North Shore Trust and Savings 
 
 North Shore Trust and Savings, a federally-chartered stock savings institution, was established in 1921 as North Shore Building and Loan, an Illinois-chartered institution. The Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of NSTS Bancorp, Inc., and operates as a traditional savings institution focused primarily on serving the banking needs of customers in our market area of Lake County, Illinois and adjacent communities. We operate from our headquarters and main banking office in Waukegan, Illinois, as well as two additional full-service branch offices located in Waukegan and Lindenhurst, Illinois, respectively. We have a loan production office in Chicago, Illinois. Our primary business activity is attracting deposits from the general public and using those funds to originate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and purchase investments. We are subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the OCC ). 
 
 Conversion of North Shore MHC 
 
 Pursuant to the conversion, North Shore MHC converted from the mutual holding company to the stock holding company corporate structure. Upon the completion of the conversion on January 18, 2022, North Shore MHC and NSTS Financial Corporation ceased to exist, and the Bank became a wholly owned subsidiary of NSTS Bancorp, Inc. 
 
 Our Business and Franchise 
 
 For 100 years, we have served Lake County, Illinois and the surrounding communities. We have established deep ties to the community and developed customer relationships which have spanned generations. We pride ourselves in matching our products and services to the needs of the community. 
 
 North Shore Trust and Savings is primarily engaged in attracting deposits from the general public and using those funds to invest in loans and securities. Our principal sources of funds are customer deposits, repayments of loans, maturities of investments and funds borrowed from outside sources such as the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago FHLB ). These funds are primarily used for the origination of loans, including one- to four-family residential first mortgage loans, commercial real estate mortgage loans, multi-family residential mortgage loans and consumer loans. North Shore Trust and Savings derives its income principally from interest earned on loans and investment securities and, to a lesser extent, from fees received in connection with the origination of loans, service charges on deposit accounts and for other services. We invest in bank owned life insurance BOLI to provide us with a funding source for our benefit plan obligations. BOLI also generally provides us noninterest income that is non-taxable. North Shore Trust and Savings primary expenses are interest expense on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses. 
 
 We are an active originator of residential home mortgage loans in our market area. North Shore Trust and Savings is a traditional thrift institution with an emphasis on long-term one- to four-family residential first mortgage loans secured by residences located in our traditional market area centered in Waukegan, Illinois. As of December 31, 2022, 95.6 million, or 92.8 of our total loan portfolio, consisted of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Our business strategy is to enhance our products and services, continue to focus on long-term one- to four-family residential first mortgage loans, and to increase our holdings of commercial real estate and multi-family residential real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans are deemed attractive due to their generally higher yields and shorter anticipated lives compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. 
 
 Our headquarters office is located at 700 S. Lewis Avenue, Waukegan, Illinois, and our telephone number is (847) 336-4430. We maintain a website at www.northshoretrust.com, and we provide our customers with on-line banking services. Information on our website should not be considered a part of this filing.

Market Area and Competition 
 
 We are headquartered in Waukegan, Illinois. In addition to our main office, we have two additional full service offices in Waukegan and Lindenhurst, Illinois, respectively, and one loan production office in Chicago, Illinois. We currently are evaluating sites for additional loan production branch offices in surrounding communities to be established over the next few years. 
 
 Our market area consists of Lake County and Cook County which are located in Illinois, and Kenosha County which is located in Wisconsin. The largest employers in Lake County are pharmaceutical and healthcare companies, including Abbott Laboratories, AbbVie, and Baxter International. The largest employers in Cook County are government entities, including the U.S. Government, Chicago Public Schools, and the City of Chicago. Kenosha County s largest employers include Amazon, Uline, and Snap-on. Overall, Lake, Cook, and Kenosha counties have a diversified employment base which helps to maintain a relatively stable economy. 
 
 We face significant competition in originating loans and attracting deposits. This competition stems primarily from credit unions, commercial banks, other savings banks and savings associations, and mortgage-banking companies. Many of the financial service providers operating in our market area are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than we do. We face additional competition for deposits from short-term money market funds and other corporate and government securities funds, mutual funds and from other non-depository financial institutions such as brokerage firms and insurance companies. 
 
 Lending Activities 
 
 General . As of December 31, 2022, our net loan portfolio totaled 103.4 million or 39.1 of total assets. Our principal lending activity has been the origination of loans collateralized by one- to four-family residential real estate loans located in our market area. We also originate commercial real estate, multi-family residential mortgage loans and consumer loans, consisting of loans secured by deposits at North Shore Trust and Savings and other collateral and unsecured personal loans.

Loan Originations, Participations and Sales. Our lending activities are subject to underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our board of directors and management. Loan originations are obtained through a variety of sources, primarily existing customers as well as new customers obtained from referrals and local advertising and promotional efforts. One- to four-family residential mortgage loan applications and consumer loan applications are taken at any of North Shore Trust and Savings branch offices or customers may submit an application on-line. Applications for other loans typically are taken personally by one of our loan officers, although they may be received by a branch office initially and then referred to a loan officer. All loan applications are processed and underwritten centrally at our branch office located in Lindenhurst, Illinois. 
 
 Our one- to four-family residential first mortgage loans are written on standardized documents used by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac and Federal National Mortgage Association Fannie Mae ). Our underwriting standards generally require that new one- to four-family residential mortgage loans conform to secondary market standards but a portion of our one- to four-family residential mortgage loans are considered non-conforming due to factors such as the borrower s job status or income, the condition or age of the residence or other factors. For loans which are secured by real estate, property valuations are undertaken by an independent third-party appraiser approved by our board of directors. 
 
 Consistent with our interest rate risk strategy, we have sold, on a servicing released basis a significant portion of our fixed rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. We consider our balance sheet as well as market conditions on an ongoing basis in making decisions as to whether to hold loans we originate for investment or to sell such loans choosing the strategy that we believe is most advantageous to us from a profitability and risk management standpoint. 
 
 In addition to originating loans, during the year ended December 31, 2022, we purchased nine loans totaling 5.3 million, which consisted primarily of 1-4 family adjustable rate mortgages in our primary lending area. Prior to purchasing, these loans were reviewed for compliance with our underwriting criteria. All loans were purchased with servicing retained by the originating bank. We actively monitor the performance of these loans through the receipt of regular reports from the originating lender regarding the loan's performance. As of December 31, 2022, all purchased loans are paying as pursuant to their contractual terms. 
 
 Further, although we have not previously purchased participation interests in commercial real estate mortgage loans, we will consider purchasing such participation interests from other financial institutions in our market area. Such participations will be reviewed for compliance with our underwriting criteria before they are purchased. We will actively monitor the performance of such loans made in the future through the receipt of regular reports from the lead lender regarding the loan s performance, physically inspecting the loan security property on a periodic basis, discussing the loan with the lead lender on a regular basis and receiving copies of updated financial statements from the borrower.

 One- to Four-Family Residential Mortgage Lending . One of our primary lending activities continues to be the origination of loans secured by first mortgages on one- to four-family residences in our market area. As of December 31, 2022, 95.6 million, or 92.8 of our total loan portfolio, consisted of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. 
 
 Applications for one-to four-family residential mortgage loans are accepted at any of our banking offices for processing, which consists primarily of obtaining all documents required to complete the underwriting, which includes making a determination whether the loan meets our underwriting standards. While our one- to four-family residential first mortgage loans are written on standardized documents used by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, our underwriting standards do not require that new one- to four-family residential mortgage loans conform to secondary market standards. A small portion of our one- to four-family residential mortgage loans are considered non-conforming , due to factors such as the borrower s job status or income, the condition or age of the residence or other factors and are not readily saleable into the secondary mortgage market. We currently originate fixed-rate, fully amortizing mortgage loans with maturities up to 30 years. We also offer adjustable rate mortgage ARM loans where the interest rate either adjusts on an annual basis or is fixed for the initial three or five years and then adjusts annually. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 15.6 of our one- to four-family residential mortgage loans maturing after December 31, 2023 were ARM loans. Our ARM loans have a cap on any increase or decrease in the interest rate of up to 2 at any adjustment date and a 5 cap above or below the initial interest rate over the life of the loan. The interest rate on our ARM loans is based on the one-year Treasury or SOFR. 
 
 Although adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans may reduce our vulnerability to changes in market interest rates because they periodically reprice, as interest rates increase, the required payments due from the borrower also increase (subject to rate caps), increasing the potential for default by the borrower. At the same time, the ability of the borrower to repay the loan and the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. Upward adjustments of the contractual interest rate are also limited by the maximum periodic and lifetime rate adjustments permitted by our loan documents. As a result, the effectiveness of adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans in compensating for changes in market interest rates may be limited during periods of rapidly rising interest rates. 
 
 We underwrite one- to four-family residential mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios which generally do not exceed 97 in the case of ARM loans and 95 in the case of fixed-rate loans, provided that the borrower obtains private mortgage insurance on loans that exceed 80 of the appraised value of the secured property. We also require that title insurance, hazard insurance and, if appropriate, flood insurance be maintained on all properties securing real estate loans. We require that a licensed appraiser from our list of approved appraisers perform and submit to us an appraisal on all properties securing one- to four-family first mortgage loans. Our mortgage loans generally include due-on-sale clauses which provide us with the contractual right to deem the loan immediately due and payable in the event the borrower transfers ownership of the property. Due-on-sale clauses are an important means of adjusting the yields of fixed-rate mortgage loans in portfolio and we generally exercise our rights under these clauses.

Multi-Family Residential and Commercial Real Estate Lending . As of December 31, 2022, our commercial real estate and multi-family residential loans amounted to an aggregate of 7.1 million, or 7.0 of our total loan portfolio. We plan to moderately increase our emphasis on commercial real estate loans and multi-family residential real estate loans as they generally have shorter terms to maturity, improving North Shore Trust and Savings interest rate risk profile, and provide higher yields than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, our multi-family residential mortgage loans amounted to 3.2 million, or 3.2 of the total loan portfolio. Our multi-family residential mortgage loans, which are underwritten and approved in a manner consistent with our commercial real estate loans, are secured by residential properties with more than four units or secured by multiple one- to four-family residential properties located in our market area. At December 31, 2022, our largest multi-family residential mortgage loan was an 861,000 loan secured by various one- to four-family investment homes and one multi-family apartment building located in Waukegan and North Chicago, Illinois, and was performing in accordance with its terms. At December 31, 2022, we had a total of 10 multi-family residential mortgage loans and the average size of our multi-family residential mortgage loans was approximately 324,000. 
 
 Our commercial real estate loan portfolio amounted to 3.9 million, or 3.8 of the total loan portfolio, at December 31, 2022. These commercial real estate loans included 12 loans secured primarily by investor properties, which include multiple one- to four-family residences. Additionally, North Shore Trust and Savings has two commercial real estate loans secured by retail frontage. The two largest commercial real estate loans outstanding were 1.8 million and 1.2 million, and both loans were paying in accordance with all of their contractual terms. 
 
 Although terms for commercial real estate and multi-family residential loans vary, our underwriting standards generally allow for terms not exceeding 30 years and loan-to-value ratios of not more than 75 . Interest rates are typically adjustable, based upon designated market indices such as The Wall Street Journal prime rate, or fixed-rate, and fees are charged to the borrower at the origination of the loan. The actual lives of such loans generally are less than their contractual terms to maturity due to prepayments and re-financings. Generally, we obtain personal guarantees of the principals as additional collateral for commercial real estate and multi-family residential loans. 
 
 Commercial real estate and multi-family residential lending involves a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential lending. These risks include larger loans to individual borrowers and loan payments that are dependent upon the successful operation of the project or the borrower s business. These risks can be affected by supply and demand conditions of rental housing units, office and retail space and other commercial space in the project s market area. We attempt to minimize these risks for loans we originate by soliciting loans from businesses with existing operating performance. We also use conservative debt coverage ratios in our underwriting, and periodically monitor the operation of the business or project and the physical condition of the property. At December 31, 2022, none of our commercial real estate or multi-family loans were delinquent more than 30 days, nor were any on non-accrual. We have had no charge-offs of commercial real estate and multi-family residential loans for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 Various aspects of commercial real estate and multi-family residential transactions are evaluated in an effort to mitigate the additional risk in these types of loans. In our underwriting procedures, consideration is given to the stability of the property s cash flow history, future operating projections, current and projected occupancy levels, location and physical condition. Generally, we impose a debt service ratio (the ratio of net cash flows from operations before the payment of debt service to debt service) of not less than 1.25x in the case of commercial real estate and multi-family residential loans. We also evaluate the credit and financial condition of the borrower, and if applicable, the guarantor. Appraisal reports prepared by independent appraisers are obtained on each loan to substantiate the property s market value and are reviewed by us prior to the closing of the loan.

Consumer Lending . In our efforts to provide a full range of financial services to our customers, we offer various types of consumer loans. Our consumer loans amounted to 249,000, or 0.2 , of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, our consumer loans were comprised of loans secured by deposits, auto loans and unsecured personal loans. 
 
 Consumer loans generally have higher interest rates and shorter terms than residential loans; however, they have additional credit risk due to the type of collateral securing the loan or in some cases the absence of collateral. We had no charge-offs on consumer loans during the year ended December 31, 2022, however, for the year ended December 31, 2021, we charged off a 99,000 unsecured consumer loan because it was six months past due. Our collection efforts are continuing. 
 
 Loan Approval Procedures and Authority . Our board of directors establishes North Shore Trust and Savings lending policies and procedures. Our Loan Policy is reviewed on at least an annual basis by our management team in order to propose modifications as a result of market conditions, regulatory changes and other factors. All modifications must be approved by our Board of Directors. 
 
 Various officers or combinations of officers of North Shore Trust and Savings have the authority within specifically identified limits to approve new loans. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum loan amount that may be approved by an individual officer is 648,250, which is consistent with secondary market limits for conforming loans. Loans up to 1.0 million are reviewed by our management loan committee, with a minimum of two members approval. Our board level loan committee has authority to approve loans up to 2.5 million. All other loans must be approved by the board of directors of North Shore Trust and Savings. 
 
 Asset Quality 
 
 General . One of our key objectives has been, and continues to be, maintaining a high level of asset quality. In addition to maintaining credit standards for new originations which we believe are sound, we are proactive in our loan monitoring, collection and workout processes in dealing with delinquent or problem loans. 
 
 When a borrower fails to make a scheduled payment, we attempt to cure the deficiency by making personal contact with the borrower. Initial contacts are generally made within 30 days after the date the payment is due. In most cases, deficiencies are promptly resolved. If the delinquency continues, late charges are assessed, and additional efforts are made to collect the deficiency. All loans which are designated as special mention, substandard, doubtful or delinquent 90 days or more are reported to the board of directors of North Shore Trust and Savings on a monthly basis. 
 
 We stop accruing interest on loans non-accrual loans) at the time the loan is 90 days past due unless the credit is adequately collateralized and in process of collection. Interest income is not accrued on these loans until the borrower s financial condition and payment record demonstrate an ability to service the debt. 
 
 Property acquired through foreclosure is initially recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, which is fair value of the related assets at the date of foreclosure, less estimated costs to sell. Thereafter, if there is a further deterioration in value, we charge earnings for the diminution in value. Our policy is to obtain an appraisal on real estate subject to foreclosure proceedings prior to the time of foreclosure. We obtain re-appraisals on a periodic basis, generally on at least an annual basis, on foreclosed properties. We also conduct inspections on foreclosed properties. 
 
 We account for our impaired loans in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Loans are reviewed on a regular basis. Loans are listed on the watch/special mention list where management has some concern that the collateral or debt service ability may not be adequate, although the collectability of the contractual loan payments is still probable. If a loan deteriorates in asset quality, the classification is changed to substandard, doubtful or loss depending on the circumstances and the evaluation. When a loan is determined to be impaired, the measurement of the loan in the allowance for loan losses is based on present value of expected future cash flows, except that all collateral-dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, loans identified as impaired and individually evaluated for impairment, amounted to 873,000 and 1.1 million, respectively. 
 
 Federal regulations and our policies require that we utilize an internal asset classification system as a means of reporting problem and potential problem assets. We have incorporated an internal asset classification system, consistent with federal banking regulations, as a part of our credit monitoring system. We currently classify problem and potential problem assets as special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss assets. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are required to be designated special mention. 
 
 A savings institution s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by Federal bank regulators which can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances. The federal banking agencies have adopted an interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan losses. The policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of management for the assessment and establishment of allowances and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation guidelines. Generally, the policy statement recommends that institutions have effective systems and controls to identify, monitor and address asset quality problems; that management analyze all significant factors that affect the collectability of the portfolio in a reasonable manner; and that management establish acceptable allowance evaluation processes that meet the objectives set forth in the policy statement. General valuation allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allocations, have not been allocated to specific problem assets. When an insured institution classifies one or more assets, or portions thereof, as loss, it is required to charge off such amount. 
 
 Our allowance for loan losses includes a portion which is allocated by type of loan, based primarily upon our periodic reviews of the risk elements within the various categories of loans. The specific components relate to certain impaired loans. The general components cover non-classified loans and are based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors in response to changes in risk and market conditions. Our management believes that, based on information currently available, the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which covers all known and inherent losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable at each reporting date. However, actual losses are dependent upon future events and, as such, further additions to the level of the allowance for loan losses may become necessary. As of January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) . Refer to Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Current Accounting Developments" for further discussion. 
 
 We review and classify loans on no less frequently than a quarterly basis and our board of directors is provided with reports on our classified and criticized assets. We classify assets in accordance with the management guidelines described above. At December 31, 2022, we had no loans classified as doubtful or loss, 188,000 of loans classified as substandard and 43,000 of loans designated as special mention.

Troubled Debt Restructurings . We occasionally modify loans to extend the term or make other concessions to help a borrower stay current on his or her loan and to avoid foreclosure. We consider modifications only after analyzing the borrower s current repayment capacity, evaluating the strength of any guarantors based on documented current financial information, and assessing the current value of any collateral pledged. We generally do not forgive principal or interest on loans but may do so if it is in our best interest and increases the likelihood that we can collect the remaining principal balance. We may modify the terms of loans to lower interest rates (which may be at below market rates), to provide for fixed interest rates on loans where fixed rates are otherwise not available, to provide for longer amortization schedules, or to provide for interest-only terms. These modifications are made only when a workout plan has been agreed to by the borrower that we believe is reasonable and attainable and in our best interests. During the year ended December 31, 2022, one loan which was classified as TDR was moved to nonaccrual status due to late payments. As of December 31, 2022, our loans which were classified as TDRs and were on accrual status and not more than 90 days past due amounted to 685,000. With the exception of the one loan moved to nonaccrual, all of such TDRs were performing in accordance with their restructured terms at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses. We maintain the allowance at a level believed, to the best of management s knowledge, to cover all known and inherent losses in the portfolio that are both probable and reasonable to estimate at each reporting date. Management reviews the allowance for loan losses on no less than a quarterly basis in order to identify those inherent losses and to assess the overall collection probability for the loan portfolio. Our evaluation process includes, among other things, an analysis of delinquency trends, non-performing loan trends, the level of charge-offs and recoveries, prior loss experience, total loans outstanding, the volume of loan originations, the type, size and geographic concentration of our loans, the value of collateral securing the loan, the borrower s ability to repay and repayment performance, the number of loans requiring heightened management oversight, national and local economic conditions and industry experience. Such risk ratings are periodically reviewed by management and revised as deemed appropriate. At December 31, 2022, and 2021, our allowance for loan losses amounted to 624,000 and 779,000 respectively. The establishment of the allowance for loan losses is significantly affected by uncertainties and management judgment and there is a likelihood that different amounts would be reported under different conditions or assumptions. Various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require North Shore Trust and Savings to make additional provisions for estimated loan losses based upon judgments different from those of management.

The investment policy is designed primarily to manage the interest rate sensitivity of the assets and liabilities, to generate a favorable return without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk, to complement the lending activities and to provide and maintain liquidity. The current investment policy generally permits investments in debt securities issued by the U.S. government and U.S. agencies, municipal bonds, and corporate debt obligations, as well as investments in preferred and common stock of government agencies and government sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHLB of Chicago. The policy also permits investments in mortgage-backed securities, including pass-through securities issued and guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Government National Mortgage Association Ginnie Mae ). 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, our securities available-for-sale portfolio totaled 121.2 million, or 45.9 of total assets at such date. The largest component of our investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2022 was investment in collateralized mortgage obligations issued by Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac, which amounted to 37.2 million, followed by pass-through mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac, which amounted to 35.7 million. Our investment in U.S. government and federal agency obligations as of December 31, 2022, was 21.4 million and our investment in municipal obligations as of December 31, 2022, was 19.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we invested in short term U.S. Treasuries, which amounted to 7.3 million as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Ginnie Mae is a government agency within the Department of Housing and Urban Development which is intended to help finance government-assisted housing programs. Ginnie Mae securities are backed by loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The timely payment of principal and interest on Ginnie Mae securities is guaranteed by Ginnie Mae and backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. Freddie Mac is a private corporation chartered by the U.S. Government. Freddie Mac issues participation certificates backed principally by conventional mortgage loans. Freddie Mac guarantees the timely payment of interest and the ultimate return of principal on participation certificates. Fannie Mae is a private corporation chartered by the U.S. Congress with a mandate to establish a secondary market for mortgage loans. Fannie Mae guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on Fannie Mae securities. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae securities are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. 
 
 Investments in mortgage-backed securities involve the risk that actual prepayments will be greater than estimated prepayments over the life of the security, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such instruments thereby changing the net yield on such securities. There is also reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities or in the event such securities are redeemed by the issuer. In addition, the market value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. 
 
 Investment securities are classified at the time of acquisition as securities available for sale, held to maturity or trading. Securities classified as held to maturity must be purchased with the intent and ability to hold that security until its final maturity and can be sold prior to maturity only under rare circumstances. Held-to-maturity securities are accounted for based upon the amortized cost of the security. Available-for-sale securities can be sold at any time based upon needs or market conditions. Available-for-sale securities are accounted for at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses on these securities, net of income tax provisions, reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2022, all securities were classified as securities available for sale. At December 31, 2022, we had no investments in a single issuer other than securities issued by U.S. Government agencies or U.S. Government sponsored enterprises, which had an aggregate book value in excess of 10 of our stockholders equity. At December 31, 2022, the available-for-sale securities portfolio had a net unrealized loss position of 15.6 million. Some investment securities held in the portfolio have declined in value but do not presently represent realized losses. Unrealized losses on investment securities have not been recognized into income because the securities are of high credit quality, the Bank has the intent and ability to hold the securities for the foreseeable future, and the declines in fair value are primarily due to market volatility and increased market interest rates. The fair values are expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity dates. 
 
 The following table sets forth the amount of investment securities which mature during each of the periods indicated and the weighted average yields for each range of maturities as of December 31, 2022. Maturities may differ from contractual maturities in mortgage-backed securities because the mortgages underlying the securities may be called or repaid without any penalties. Therefore, these securities have been included in based on average remaining life. The below yields represent tax equivalent yield.

Investment Activities 
 
 Investments in mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual prepayments will be greater than estimated prepayments over the life of the security, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such instruments thereby changing the net yield on such securities. There is also reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities or in the event such securities are redeemed by the issuer. In addition, the market value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. 
 
 Additionally, we hold interest-bearing deposits at financial institutions throughout the United States. Some of these accounts have balances above the FDIC s per account insurance limit of 250,000. The amount of our total deposits with accounts over the FDIC's insurance limit of 250,000 was 43.6 million, or 24.4 of total deposits, and 42.5 million or 14.9 of total deposits, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We monitor that credit risk on a quarterly basis. We also hold funds in the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and the FHLB of Chicago. 
 
 Sources of Funds 
 
 General . Deposits, loan repayments and prepayments, proceeds from investment sales, calls, maturities and pay-downs, cash flows generated from operations and FHLB of Chicago advances are the primary sources of our funds for use in lending, investing and for other general purposes. 
 
 Deposits . We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms. Our deposits consist of checking, both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing, money market, savings and time deposit accounts. As of December 31, 2022, 69.0 of the funds deposited with North Shore Trust and Savings were in core deposits, which are deposits other than time deposits. 
 
 The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market rates, prevailing interest rates and competition. Our deposits are obtained predominantly from the areas where our branch offices are located. We have historically relied primarily on customer service and long-standing relationships with customers to attract and retain these deposits; however, market interest rates and rates offered by competing financial institutions significantly affect our ability to attract and retain deposits. 
 
 We use traditional means of advertising deposit products, including broadcast and print media and we generally do not solicit deposits from outside our market area. In recent years, we have emphasized the origination of core deposits.

 Borrowings . Historically, we have not utilized advances from the FHLB of Chicago. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the FHLB offered advances with a 0 interest rate that the Bank utilized. On May 12, 2022, the Bank repaid the existing 0 interest rate FHLB advance totaling 5.0 million that was due on May 23, 2022. Additionally, on May 21, 2021, the Bank repaid the existing non-interest bearing FHLB advance totaling 4.0 million that was due on May 24, 2021.

As of December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings. The Bank is eligible to borrow up to a total of 68.6 million and 60.8 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which would be collateralized by 86.6 million and 76.8 million of first mortgage loans under a blanket lien arrangement at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additionally, at December 31, 2022 we had a 10.0 million federal funds line of credit with the BMO Harris Bank, none of which was drawn at December 31, 2022. 
 
 Expense and Tax Allocation 
 
 North Shore Trust and Savings has an agreement with NSTS Bancorp, Inc., to provide it with certain administrative support services for compensation not less than the fair market value of the services provided. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the total of these services was 411,000. In addition, North Shore Trust and Savings and NSTS Bancorp, Inc. have an agreement that establishes a method for allocating and for reimbursing the payment of their consolidated tax liability. 
 
 Employees and Human Capital Resources 
 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 35 full-time equivalent employees. None of such employees are represented by a collective bargaining group, and we believe that our relationship with our employees is excellent. The success of our business is highly dependent on our employees, who provide value to our customers and communities. Our workplace culture provides a set of core values: a concern for others, trust, respect, hard work and a dedication to our customers. We seek to hire well-qualified employees who are also a good fit for our value system. 
 
 We believe that our ability to attract and retain top quality employees is a key to our future success. During 2022, we elevated Nathan E. Walker to Chief Executive Officer of North Shore Trust and Savings. Additionally, we welcomed Ronald K. Jackson to the Mortgage Lending Team as the VP of Mortgage Originations. Ronald comes to us with over 29 years experience in the mortgage industry, primarily in our lending area. We continue to elevate individuals from within the organization into new roles and we expect to continue to assess our management and staffing needs and are likely to add personnel in the future in order to fully implement our business strategy. 
 
 In an effort to continue our investment in our employees and as part of the conversion, North Shore Trust and Savings established the Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") for its employees. Shares held in the ESOP will be released and allocated to employees on an annual basis based on the ratio of each such participant's annual compensation. 
 
 The safety, health and wellness of our employees is a top priority. The COVID-19 pandemic presented a unique challenge with regard to maintaining employee safety while continuing successful operations. Through teamwork and the adaptability of our management and staff, we were able to provide a safely distanced working environment for employees performing customer-facing activities, at branches and operations centers. On an ongoing basis, we further promote the health and wellness of our employees by strongly encouraging work-life balance, offering flexible work schedules, and keeping the dollar amount of the employee portion of health care premiums relatively low.

Employee retention helps us operate efficiently and achieve one of our business objectives, which is being a low-cost provider. We believe our commitment to living out our core values, actively prioritizing concern for our employees well-being, supporting our employees career goals, offering competitive wages and providing valuable fringe benefits aids in retention of our top-performing employees. 
 
 Federal Income Taxation 
 
 General . NSTS Bancorp, Inc. and North Shore Trust and Savings are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal and state income taxation is only intended to summarize certain pertinent income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the applicable tax rules. North Shore Trust and Savings income tax returns have not been audited by a taxing authority during the past five years. 
 
 Beginning in 2022, NSTS Bancorp, Inc. filed a consolidated federal income tax return with North Shore Trust and Savings. Any cash distributions made by NSTS Bancorp, Inc. to its stockholders would be treated as cash dividends and not as returns of capital to stockholders for federal and state income tax purposes. 
 
 Method of Accounting . For federal income tax purposes, we report income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and use a December 31 tax year for filing our federal income tax returns. 
 
 Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction . NSTS Bancorp, Inc., as an affiliate of North Shore Trust and Savings, is able to exclude from its income for federal income tax purposes 100 of the dividends received from North Shore Trust and Savings. 
 
 State Taxation 
 
 NSTS Bancorp, Inc. is subject to Illinois corporate income tax and replacement tax based on its Illinois taxable income and Wisconsin corporate income tax on its Wisconsin taxable income. 
 
 SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 
 
 General 
 
 As a federal savings association, North Shore Trust and Savings is subject to examination and regulation by the OCC, and is also subject to examination by the FDIC as deposit insurer. The federal system of regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which North Shore Trust and Savings may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the FDIC s Deposit Insurance Fund, and not for the protection of stockholders. North Shore Trust and Savings, also, is a member of and owns stock in the FHLB of Chicago, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. 
 
 Under this system of regulation, the regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory, enforcement, rulemaking and examination activities and policies, including rules or policies that: establish minimum capital levels; restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments; govern the classification of assets; provide oversight for the adequacy of loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes; and establish the timing and amounts of assessments and fees. Moreover, as part of their examination authority, the banking regulators assign numerical ratings to banks and savings institutions relating to capital, asset quality, management, liquidity, earnings and other factors. These ratings are inherently subjective and the receipt of a less-than-satisfactory rating in one or more categories may result in enforcement action by the banking regulators against a financial institution. A less than satisfactory rating may also prevent a financial institution, such as North Shore Trust and Savings or its holding company, NSTS Bancorp, Inc., from obtaining necessary regulatory approvals to access the capital markets, pay dividends, acquire other financial institutions or establish new branches. 
 
 In addition, we must comply with significant anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws and regulations, Community Reinvestment Act laws and regulations, and fair lending laws and regulations. Government agencies have the authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on institutions that fail to comply with these laws and regulations, which could significantly affect our business activities, including our ability to acquire other financial institutions or expand our branch network.

Table of Contents 

As a savings and loan holding company, NSTS Bancorp, Inc. is required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. It is required to file certain reports with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to examination by and the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve Board. NSTS Bancorp, Inc. is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the federal securities laws. 
 
 Any change in applicable laws or regulations, whether by the OCC, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board, the SEC or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial performance of NSTS Bancorp, Inc. and North Shore Trust and Savings. 
 
 Set forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are applicable to North Shore Trust and Savings and NSTS Bancorp, Inc. The description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed in this filing, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on North Shore Trust and Savings and NSTS Bancorp, Inc. 
 
 Federal Banking Regulation 
 
 Business Activities . A federal savings association derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners Loan Act, as amended, and applicable federal regulations. Under these laws and regulations, a federal savings association may generally invest in mortgage loans secured by residential real estate without an aggregate limit, and commercial business, commercial real estate and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets, subject to overall percentage of assets or capital limits. Federal savings associations are also subject to a Qualified Thrift Lender Test, or QTL Test, which generally requires that a specified percentage of overall assets be residential mortgages and related investments. 
 
 Effective July 1, 2019, the OCC issued a final rule, pursuant to a provision of the Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act EGRRCPA ), that permits a federal savings association to elect to exercise national bank powers without converting to a national bank charter. The election is available to federal savings associations that had total consolidated assets of 20 billion or less as of December 31, 2017. North Shore Trust and Savings has not exercised the covered savings association election. 
 
 A federal savings association that has exercised the covered savings association election generally has the same rights and privileges as a national bank that has its main office in the same location as the home office of the covered savings association. The covered savings association is also subject to the same duties, restrictions, liabilities and limitations applicable to a national bank. A covered savings association retains its federal savings association charter and continues to be subject to the corporate governance laws and regulations applicable to such associations, including as to its bylaws, board of directors and stockholders, capital distributions and mergers. 
 
 A covered savings association may make loans to its customers without regard to the lending restrictions applicable to federal savings associations, such as the percentage of capital or assets limits on various types of loans and the QTL Test. However, federal savings associations that have made such an election are subject to the narrower authority of national banks in certain areas such as branching and subsidiary activities in certain respects. A covered savings association may generally not retain any assets, subsidiaries or activities not permitted for national banks. 
 
 Applicable regulations authorize a federal association that has exercised the covered savings association election to terminate the election and thereby again operate as a federal savings association that has not made a covered savings association election. We have no current plans to elect to be treated as a covered savings association. 
 
 Capital Requirements . Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5 , a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0 , a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8.0 , and a 4.0 Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. 
 
 EGRRCPA required the federal banking agencies, including the OCC, to establish a community bank leverage ratio, referred to in this filing as the CBLR, of between 8 and 10 for institutions with assets of less than 10 billion. The community bank leverage is the ratio of a bank s tangible Tier 1 equity capital to average total consolidated assets and was established by the regulators at 9 . Institutions with capital complying with the ratio and otherwise meeting the specified requirements and electing the alternative framework are considered to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. A qualifying institution may opt in and out of the CBLR framework on its quarterly call report. The CBLR option was effective January 1, 2020 and is available to institutions with assets of less than 10 billion that meet other specified criteria. The federal banking agencies issued a rule implementing the lower ratio, effective April 23, 2020. The rule also established a two-quarter grace period for a qualifying institution whose leverage ratio falls below the 8 requirement so long as the bank maintains a leverage ratio of 7 or greater. Another rule was issued to transition to the 9 CBLR by increasing the ratio to 8.5 for calendar year 2021 and 9 thereafter. A qualifying community bank that exercises the election and has capital equal to or exceeding the applicable percentage is considered compliant with all applicable regulatory capital requirements. Qualifying institutions may elect to utilize the CBLR in lieu of the generally applicable risk-based capital requirements. North Shore Trust and Savings has elected to utilize the CBLR framework.

Table of Contents 

As of December 31, 2022, North Shore Trust and Savings capital exceeded all applicable requirements including the applicable conservation buffer. 
 
 Loans-to-One Borrower . Generally, a federal savings association, including a covered savings association, may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15 of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, equal to 10 of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the excess is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of December 31, 2022, North Shore Trust and Savings was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations. 
 
 Capital Distributions . Federal regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings association, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the savings association s capital account. A federal savings association must file an application with the OCC for approval of a capital distribution if: 

the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the savings association s net income for that year to date plus the savings association s retained net income for the preceding two years; 

the savings association would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution; 

the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or regulatory condition; or 

the savings association is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings, generally due to an unsatisfactory CAMELS rating or being subject to a cease and desist order or formal written agreement that requires action to improve the institution s financial condition. 

Even if an application is not otherwise required, every savings association that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as North Shore Trust and Savings, must still file a notice with the Federal Reserve Board at least 30 days before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution. 

19

Table of Contents 

A notice or application related to a capital distribution may be disapproved if: 

the federal savings association would be undercapitalized following the distribution; 

the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or 

the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement. 

In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act generally provides that an insured depository institution may not make any capital distribution if, after making such distribution, the institution would fail to meet any applicable regulatory capital requirement. A federal savings association also may not make a capital distribution that would reduce its regulatory capital below the amount required for the liquidation account established in connection with its conversion to stock form. 
 
 Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws . All insured depository institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers. The OCC is required to assess the federal savings association s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. A savings association s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the OCC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. 
 
 On July 20, 2021, the OCC, FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board issued a joint statement committing to work together to strengthen and modernize the Community Reinvestment Act rules. On May 5, 2022, the OCC, FDIC and Federal Reserve Board issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking with the goals of (i) expanding access to credit, investment and basic banking services in low- and moderate-income communities, (ii) adapting to changes in the banking industry, including internet and mobile banking, (iii) providing greater clarity, consistency and transparency, (iv) tailoring Community Reinvestment Act evaluation and data collection to bank size and type, and (v) maintaining a unified approach. However, these agencies have not yet issued a new proposed rule. At this time, no rules have been proposed or finalized, and we are unable to determine what impact, if any, any finalized rule may have on the operations of North Shore Trust and Savings. 
 
 The Community Reinvestment Act requires all institutions insured by the FDIC to publicly disclose their rating. North Shore Trust and Savings received an Outstanding Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal examination. 
 
 Transactions with Related Parties . An insured depository institution s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulation. An affiliate is generally a company that controls, or is under common control with, an insured depository institution such as North Shore Trust and Savings. NSTS Bancorp, Inc. is an affiliate of North Shore Trust and Savings because of its control of North Shore Trust and Savings. In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative limits and collateral requirements. In addition, federal regulations prohibit a savings association from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve the purchase of low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. 
 
 North Shore Trust and Savings authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10 stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders: 

be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and 

not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of North Shore Trust and Savings capital. 

In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by North Shore Trust and Savings board of directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved. 
 
 Enforcement . The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings associations and has authority to bring enforcement action against all institution-affiliated parties, including directors, officers, stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on a federal savings association. Formal enforcement action by the OCC may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution and the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to 25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as 1 million per day. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or recommend to the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular federal savings association. If such action is not taken, the FDIC has authority to take the action under specified circumstances.

Standards for Safety and Soundness . Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties. 
 
 Branching . A federal savings association that has elected covered savings association status is subject to the laws and regulations governing the establishment of branches by national banks. Generally, intrastate and interstate branching is authorized to the extent that the law of the state involved authorizes branching for banks that it charters. Such authority is subject to OCC approval for new branches. 
 
 Prompt Corrective Action . Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulators take prompt corrective action with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For this purpose, the law establishes five capital categories: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Under applicable regulations, an institution is deemed to be well-capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0 or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5 or greater. An institution is adequately capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0 or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5 or greater. An institution is undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 , a leverage ratio of less than 4.0 or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5 . An institution is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0 , a leverage ratio of less than 3.0 or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0 . An institution is considered to be critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0 . 
 
 At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on the payment of dividends, and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. An undercapitalized bank s compliance with a capital restoration plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5.0 of the institution s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an undercapitalized bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. Significantly undercapitalized banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional restrictions, including a regulatory order to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, ceasing receipt of deposits from correspondent banks, dismissal of directors or officers and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status. 
 
 The previously referenced final rule establishing an elective community bank leverage ratio regulatory capital framework provides that a qualifying institution whose capital exceeds the community bank leverage ratio and opts to use that framework will be considered well-capitalized for purposes of prompt corrective action. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, North Shore Trust and Savings met the criteria for being considered well-capitalized. 
 
 Insurance of Deposit Accounts . The Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions such as North Shore Trust and Savings, generally up to a maximum of 250,000 per separately insured depositor. The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. 
 
 Under the FDIC s risk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less risky of failure pay lower assessments. Assessments for institutions of less than 10 billion of assets are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of an institution s failure within three years.

Table of Contents 

The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of North Shore Trust and Savings. We cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future. 
 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance. 
 
 Privacy and Cybersecurity . The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA, and its implementing regulations issued by federal regulatory agencies require financial institutions (including banks) to adopt policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about their customers to non-affiliated third parties. In general, financial institutions are required to explain to customers their policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information and, unless otherwise required or permitted by law, financial institutions are prohibited from disclosing such information except as provided in their policies and procedures. Specifically, the GLBA established certain information security guidelines that require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to develop, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, to protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. North Shore Trust and Savings currently has a privacy protection policy and security program in place and believes that such policy and program are in compliance with applicable regulations. 
 
 Recent cyber-attacks against banks and other financial institutions that resulted in unauthorized access to confidential customer information have prompted the federal banking regulators to issue extensive guidance on cybersecurity. Among other things, financial institutions are expected to design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and ensure that their risk management processes address the risks posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to authenticate customers accessing Internet-based services. A financial institution also should have a robust business continuity program to recover from a cyberattack and procedures for monitoring the security of third-party service providers that may have access to nonpublic data at the institution. 
 
 In November 2021, the federal regulators finalized a rule concerning notification requirements for banks related to significant computer security incidents. Under the final rule, a bank or its holding company is required to notify its applicable federal banking regulators within 36 hours of incidents that have materially disrupted or degraded, or are reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, the banking organization s ability to deliver services to a material portion of its customer base, jeopardize the viability of key operations of the organization, or impact the stability of the financial sector. The rule was effective April 1, 2022 and compliance was required by May 1, 2022. 
 
 Anti-Money Laundering and the USA PATRIOT Act . North Shore Trust and Savings is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act. These statutes and related rules and regulations impose requirements and limitations on specified financial transactions and accounts and other relationships intended to guard against money laundering and terrorism financing. The principal requirements for an insured depository institution include (i) establishment of an anti-money laundering program that includes training and audit components, (ii) establishment of a know your customer program involving due diligence to confirm the identities of persons seeking to open accounts and to deny accounts to those persons unable to demonstrate their identities, (iii) the filing of currency transaction reports for deposits and withdrawals of large amounts of cash, (iv) additional precautions for accounts sought and managed for non-U.S. persons and (v) verification and certification of money-laundering risk with respect to private banking and foreign correspondent banking relationships. For many of these tasks a bank must keep records to be made available to its primary federal regulator. Anti-money laundering rules and policies are developed by a bureau within the Treasury Department, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ("FinCEN"), but compliance by individual institutions is overseen by its primary federal regulator. 
 
 North Shore Trust and Savings has established appropriate anti-money laundering and customer identification programs. North Shore Trust and Savings also maintains records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, files reports of certain cash transactions exceeding 10,000 (daily aggregate amount) and reports suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion or other criminal activities pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act. North Shore Trust and Savings otherwise has implemented policies and procedures to comply with the foregoing requirements. 
 
 The Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC publishes lists of persons, organizations and countries suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. If North Shore Trust and Savings finds a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, North Shore Trust and Savings must freeze or block such account or transaction, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities.

On January 1, 2021, Congress passed the Corporate Transparency Act as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, which enacted the most significant overhaul of the anti-money laundering laws since the USA PATRIOT Act. Notable amendments include (i) significant changes to the collection of beneficial ownership information and the establishment of a beneficial ownership registry, which requires corporate entities (generally, any corporation, limited liability company, or other similar entity with 20 or fewer employees and annual gross income of 5 million or less) to report beneficial ownership information to FinCEN (which will be maintained by FinCEN and made available upon request to financial institutions); (ii) enhanced whistleblower provisions, which provide that one or more whistleblowers who voluntarily provide original information leading to the successful prosecution of violations of the anti-money laundering laws in any judicial or administrative action brought by the Secretary of the Treasury or the U.S. Attorney General resulting in monetary sanctions exceeding 1 million (including disgorgement and interest but excluding forfeiture, restitution, or compensation to victims) will receive not more than 30 of the monetary sanctions collected and will receive increased protections; (iii) increased penalties for violations of anti-money laundering laws and regulations; (iv) improvements to existing information sharing provisions that permit financial institutions to share information relating to suspicious activity reports with foreign branches, subsidiaries, and affiliates (except those located in China, Russia, or certain other jurisdictions) for the purpose of combating illicit finance risks; and (v) expanded duties and enforcement powers for FinCEN. Many of the amendments, including those with respect to beneficial ownership, require FinCEN to promulgate rules. On September 29, 2022, FinCEN finalized the first of three proposed rules to implement changes to the beneficial ownership requirements and related amendments set forth in the Corporate Transparency Act. The final rule prescribes which corporate entities created in or registered to do business in the U.S. will be required to report beneficial ownership information directly to FinCEN. The rule is effective and compliance is required on January 1, 2024. On December 15, 2022, FinCEN issued a second proposed rule to establish and manage access to beneficial ownership information that FinCEN will collect and maintain once all three rules are finalized. At this time, due to the fact that two of the proposed rules have not yet been finalized and issued, respectively, we are unable to determine what impact, if any, the finalized rules may have on the operations of North Shore Trust and Savings. 
 
 Prohibitions against Tying Arrangements . Federal savings associations are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution. 
 
 Other Regulations 
 
 Interest and other charges collected or contracted by North Shore Trust and Savings are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Loan operations are also subject to state and federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the: 

Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; 

Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; 

Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; and 

Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws. 

The deposit operations of North Shore Trust and Savings also are subject to, among others, the: 

Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; 

Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as Check 21 ), which gives substitute checks, such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; and 

Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services. 

Federal Home Loan Bank System 
 
 North Shore Trust and Savings is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. Each Federal Home Loan Bank provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions, and such member institutions are required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. North Shore Trust and Savings was in compliance with this requirement as of December 31, 2022 based on its ownership of 550,000 in capital stock of the FHLB of Chicago. The stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. North Shore Trust and Savings reviews for impairment, based on the ultimate recoverability, the cost basis of the FHLB of Chicago s stock. As of December 31, 2022, no impairment had been recognized.

Holding Company Regulation 
 
 NSTS Bancorp, Inc. is a unitary savings and loan holding company subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over NSTS Bancorp, Inc. and its non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a risk to North Shore Trust and Savings. 
 
 As a savings and loan holding company, NSTS Bancorp, Inc. s activities are limited to those activities permissible by law for financial holding companies (if NSTS Bancorp, Inc. makes an election to be treated as a financial holding company and meets the other requirements to be a financial holding company) or multiple savings and loan holding companies. NSTS Bancorp, Inc. has no present intention to make an election to be treated as a financial holding company. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. Such activities include lending and other activities permitted for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, insurance and underwriting equity securities. Multiple savings and loan holding companies are authorized to engage in activities specified by federal regulation, including activities permitted for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act. 
 
 Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5 of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board, and from acquiring or retaining control of any depository institution not insured by the FDIC. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board must consider such factors as the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on and the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. A savings and loan holding company may not acquire a savings institution in another state and hold the target institution as a separate subsidiary unless it is a supervisory acquisition or the law of the state in which the target is located authorizes such acquisitions by out-of-state companies. 
 
 As a savings and loan holding company with less than 3.0 billion in consolidated assets, NSTS Bancorp, Inc. is currently exempt from consolidated regulatory capital requirements. 
 
 The Federal Reserve Board has promulgated regulations implementing the source of strength doctrine that require holding companies, including savings and loan holding companies, to act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. 
 
 The Federal Reserve Board has issued supervisory policies regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company s net income for the past four quarters, net of capital distributions previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also states that a holding company should inform the Federal Reserve Board supervisory staff before redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, at the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of NSTS Bancorp, Inc. to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
 
 Change in Control Regulations 
 
 Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a savings and loan holding company, such as NSTS Bancorp, Inc., unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25 of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the institution s directors or a determination by the regulator that the acquirer has the power, directly or indirectly, to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the institution. There is a presumption of control upon the acquisition of 10 or more of a class of voting stock if the holding company involved has its shares registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or, if the holding company involved does not have its shares registered under the Exchange Act, if no other persons will own, control or hold the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting security after the acquisition.

 This discussion and analysis reflects the consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data, and is intended to enhance your understanding of the financial condition and results of operations of NSTS Bancorp, Inc. and North Shore Trust and Savings for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The purpose of this discussion is to provide information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from the consolidated financial statements. You should read the information in this section in conjunction with the other business and financial information provided in this annual report. 
 
 Overview 
 
 North Shore Trust and Savings is a community-oriented savings institution headquartered in Waukegan, Illinois. We operate as a traditional thrift relying on the origination of long-term one- to four-family residential mortgage loans secured by property in Lake County, Illinois and surrounding communities. We also originate multi-family and commercial real estate loans and, to a lesser extent, construction, home equity, and consumer loans. We currently operate three full-service banking offices in Lake County, Illinois and one loan production office in Chicago. Our primary sources of funds consist of attracting deposits from the general public and using those funds along with funds from the FHLB of Chicago and other sources to originate loans to our customers and invest in securities. As of December 31, 2022, we had total assets of 264.2 million, including 103.4 million in net loans and 121.2 million of securities available for sale, total deposits of 178.7 million and total equity of 80.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had a net income of 27,000 compared to a net loss of 55,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 
 Our results of operations depend, to a large extent, on net interest income, which is the difference between the income earned on our loan and investment portfolios and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Our net interest income is largely determined by our net interest spread, which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, and the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Results of operations are also affected by our provisions for loan losses, fee income and other noninterest income and noninterest expense. Noninterest expense principally consists of compensation, office occupancy and equipment expense, data processing, advertising and business promotion and other expenses. We expect that our noninterest expenses will increase as we grow and expand our operations. In addition, our compensation expense will increase due to the new stock benefit plans we intend to implement. Our results of operations and financial condition are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions, particularly changes in interest rates, changes in accounting guidance, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities.

Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 In reviewing and understanding financial information for NSTS Bancorp, Inc., you are encouraged to read and understand the significant accounting policies used in preparing our financial statements. These policies are described in Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page 47 of this filing. Our accounting and financial reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and to general practices within the banking industry. Accordingly, the financial statements require certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions, which are believed to be reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods presented. The JOBS Act of 2012 contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an emerging growth company we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. 
 
 The following accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These policies require numerous estimates or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or may be subject to variations which may significantly affect our reported results and financial condition for the period or in future periods. 
 
 Employee Retention Credit. Under the provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act signed into law on March 27, 2020 and the subsequent extension of the CARES Act, the Bank was eligible for a refundable employee retention credit subject to certain criteria. The Bank qualified for the tax credit for the quarters ended June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021 under the CARES Act. The Bank utilized the gross receipts method of calculating eligibility. Based on the eligibility, the tax credit is equal to 70 of qualified wages paid to employees during a quarter, and the limit on qualified wages per employee is 10,000 of qualified wages per quarter. 
 
 The Employee Retention Credit of 503,000 was recorded during the second quarter of 2022, when the Bank determined it was eligible. The credit is recorded as other non-interest income and offsets 503,000 of salaries and employee benefits expense previously recorded during 2021. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Bank has received 259,000 of the Employee Retention Credit, which represents the tax credit for the quarter ended June 30, 2021. The Bank cannot reasonably estimate when it will receive the remaining refunds. A receivable is recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets to reflect the remaining amount of the credit yet to be received. The CARES Act and related Employee Retention Credit was terminated as of September 30, 2021, and therefore the Company does not expect to file for any additional refunds. 
 
 Allowance for Loan Losses . We have identified the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses as a critical accounting policy where amounts are sensitive to material variation. The allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate for probable losses that are inherent in our loan portfolio but which have not yet been realized as of the date of our balance sheet. It is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance. The allowance is an amount that management believes will cover known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio based on evaluations of the collectability of loans. The evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the types and amount of loans in the loan portfolio, historical loss experience, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, estimated losses relating to specifically identified loans, and current economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including, among others, exposure at default, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impacted loans, value of collateral, estimated losses on our commercial and residential loan portfolios, and general amounts for historical loss experience. All of these estimates may be susceptible to significant changes as more information becomes available. 
 
 While management uses the best information available to make loan loss allowance evaluations, adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions or changes in accounting guidance. Historically, our estimates of the allowance for loan loss have not required significant adjustments from management s initial estimates. In addition, the OCC as an integral part of their examination processes periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses. The OCC may require the recognition of adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on its judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from management s estimates, additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods.

Total Assets . Total assets decreased 76.7 million, or 22.5 , to 264.2 million at December 31, 2022 compared to 340.9 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease is a direct result of a decrease in cash and cash equivalents as a result of refunds issued due to the oversubscription of stock purchases related to the stock offering and conversion. 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents. The funds received as part of the conversion were primarily held in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2021, and excess funds were disbursed during the first quarter of 2022. The disbursement resulted in a decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the period. Additionally, management continued to deploy the remaining funds from the stock offering primarily in securities available for sale, resulting in a further decrease to the balance of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021. The Bank monitors our liquidity position on a daily basis and continues to maintain levels of liquid assets deemed adequate by management. 
 
 Securities Available for Sale . Securities available for sale increased 20.2 million, or 20.0 , to 121.2 million at December 31, 2022 compared to 101.0 million at December 31, 2021. This increase was the result of management's efforts to reduce the cash and cash equivalents balance by investing in higher yielding assets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Bank purchased 59.5 million in securities available for sale, which was partially offset by principal repayments and maturities of 22.9 million, an increase in the unrealized loss on available for sale securities of 15.4 million, due to increases in market interest rates, and amortization and accretion of premiums and discounts of 958,000. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Bank purchased U.S. Treasury Notes of 12.3 million, resulting in a slight adjustment to the mix of the securities available-for-sale as well as reducing the duration of the portfolio while maintaining a higher yielding portfolio. 
 
 Loans, net . Our loans, net, increased by 6.8 million, or 7.0 , to 103.4 million at December 31, 2022 compared to 96.5 million at December 31, 2021. The increase in loans was primarily driven by the purchase of a loan pool consisting of 9 loans totaling 5.3 million. The loan pool was purchased with a 113,000 premium that is amortized over the life of the loans. The loans included in the loan pool followed the same underwriting standards required for loans originated by the Bank and are 1-4 family residential mortgages located in Cook County. Additionally, this pool has a weighted average coupon of 4.13 , with adjustable rates set to adjust in 3-7 years. The Bank originated 16.5 million in loans for the portfolio during the year, offset by loan repayments of 15.3 million. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, the allowance for loan losses was 624,000, a decrease of 155,000 compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to a decrease in specific reserves on troubled debt restructurings as a result of payoffs, and general economic improvements during 2022. During the year ending December 31, 2022, six impaired loans, totaling 302,000 as of December 31, 2021, with a combined specific reserve of 29,000 as of December 31, 2021 paid off in full. The rolling average unemployment rate in Kenosha/Lake Counties continues to decline, resulting in a reduction to qualitative adjustments in the allowance for loan losses. Additionally, the Bank has reduced its qualitative adjustment due to reduced COVID-19 uncertainties. The Bank has not experienced losses specific to COVID-19 during the pandemic. Non-performing loans, consisting of 2 loans, were 154,000 at December 31, 2022 compared to 143,000 at December 31, 2021. 
 
 Deposits . Our total deposits were 178.7 million at December 31, 2022, a decrease of 106.9 million, or 37.4 , from 285.6 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease in deposits was primarily the result of refunds issued due to the oversubscription of stock purchases related to the stock offering and a capital infusion into the Bank in the amount of half the net proceeds received as part of the conversion. As of December 31, 2021, prior to the conversion, the Company held a deposit account at the Bank of approximately 87.3 million. Subsequent to the conversion, the balance of the deposit account held at the Bank is eliminated during consolidation. Additionally, prior to September 30, 2021, the Bank received an increase in funds within the deposit accounts as individuals opened accounts to receive priority in purchasing stock as part of the offering. Subsequent to the conversion, approximately 10.0 million in funds remaining in those accounts were withdrawn by depositors. A majority of these funds were held in short-term time deposits and were subject to interest penalties upon withdrawal. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, deposits continued to decrease as a result of various large customers moving money to high yielding accounts outside the Bank. Management continues to actively monitor the deposit balances and interest rates offered to maintain an adequate level of liquidity.

Other Borrowings . During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Bank repaid the 0 interest FHLB Advance of 5.0 million, resulting in no Other Borrowings as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Total Equity . Total equity increased 35.3 million, or 78.1 , to 80.5 million at December 31, 2022, from 45.2 million at December 31, 2021. The increase in total equity is the result of the net proceeds of the conversion stock offering, less unallocated shares of the ESOP, offset by the increase in the unrealized loss on securities available for sale. At December 31, 2022, our ratio of total equity to total assets was 30.5 .

Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 
 
 General. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had net income of 27,000, compared to a net loss of 55,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net income is primarily the result of an increase in interest income on securities available-for-sale, a decrease in interest expense on deposits, recognition of the Employee Retention Credit and a higher reversal of the provision for loan losses, offset by an increase in noninterest expense. 
 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased 1.5 million, or 36.6 , to 5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our interest rate spread increased to 2.01 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 1.64 for the year ended December 31, 2021, and our net interest margin increased to 2.15 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 1.75 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest rate spread and net interest margin was primarily the result of the deployment of funds from the conversion into higher yielding assets, such as securities available-for-sale, while maintaining deposit rates. 
 
 Average interest-earning assets of 259.2 million in 2022 increased 25.7 million compared to 2021. The increase in average earning assets was driven by the funds received as part of the conversion. With the additional funds we had a 24.7 million, or 26.2 , increase in average securities available for sale, as a result of the decision to invest available cash in securities available for sale to achieve a higher yield. The average outstanding balance of loans decreased 695,000, or 0.7 , in 2022; however, due to higher interest rates earned on the loan portfolio of 7 basis points, interest earned increased 49,000, or 1.4 . 
 
 Notwithstanding a general increase in market interest rates during 2022, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 8 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The net decrease in our funding costs was primarily driven by a decrease in the average yield of time deposits. During the first quarter of 2022, subsequent to the conversion closing, certain customers withdrew their funds held in time deposits prior to the maturity of these deposits. Upon the withdrawal of these funds, the customers were charged an interest penalty which resulted in a lower overall funding cost during the quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2022, management increased interest rates on premium money market accounts and new time deposits to stay competitive with rates offered in our market area.

Reversal of Provision for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings as losses are estimated to have occurred in our loan portfolio. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the collectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. 
 
 The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, estimated value of the underlying collateral, and prevailing economic conditions. The evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. 
 
 A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information or events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan is impaired, the measurement of such impairment is based upon the fair value of the collateral of the loan. If the fair value of the collateral is less than the recorded investment in the loan, we will recognize the impairment by creating a valuation allowance with a corresponding charge against earnings. 
 
 An allowance is also established for uncollectible interest on loans classified as substandard. The allowance is established by a charge to interest income equal to all interest previously accrued, and income is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash payments are received. When, in management s judgment, the borrower s ability to make interest and principal payments is back to normal, the loan is returned to accrual status. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, a reversal of the provision for loan losses of 230,000 was recorded due to a decrease in specific reserves on troubled debt restructurings as a result of payoffs and general economic improvements during 2022. The rolling average unemployment rate in Kenosha/Lake Counties continues to decline. Additionally, the Bank has reduced its qualitative adjustment due to reduced COVID-19 uncertainties. The Bank has not experienced losses specific to COVID-19 during the pandemic. Additionally, we recorded net recoveries of 75,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to net charge-offs of 68,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

The establishment of the allowance for loan losses is significantly affected by uncertainties and management judgment and there is a likelihood that different amounts would be reported under different conditions or assumptions. Various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require us to make additional provisions for estimated loan losses based upon judgments different from those of management.

Noninterest income stayed flat at 1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Bank recognized a one time Employee Retention Credit of 503,000. The Employee Retention Credit was recorded during the second quarter of 2022, when management determined the Bank was eligible. The credit is recorded as other non-interest income and offsets 503,000 of salaries and employee benefits expense previously recorded during 2021. The CARES Act and related Employee Retention Credit was terminated as of September 30, 2021, and therefore the Company does not expect to file for any additional refunds. This increase in other non-interest income was offset by a decrease in gain on sale of securities and gain on sale of loans. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Bank did not sell any securities available for sale, primarily as a result of the unrealized loss position of the securities. Management does not currently intend to sell securities in an unrealized loss position. Additionally, during 2022, we sold 8.6 million in loans compared to 21.2 million during 2021. The decrease in the sale of mortgage loans was partially due to the decision to originate a higher percentage of loans for the portfolio, as well as an overall decrease in total loans originated during 2022.

Noninterest expense increased 1.3 million, or 23.2 , to 6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The primary drivers for the increase in noninterest expense are salaries and employee benefits and professional services expenses. Salaries and employee benefits increased 705,000 as a result of a continued investment in our employees, including an increase in average headcount from 35 employees during 2021 to 37 employees during 2022 primarily in management roles, 246,000 in expenses related to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan, annual raises and merit increases. Professional service fees increased 361,000 to 500,000 during the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase is the result of additional expenses associated with being a public company and are expected to reoccur in future periods. Other noninterest expense increased 190,000 during the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to additional expenses associated with the filing for the Employee Retention Credit.

We expect noninterest expense to increase because of costs associated with operating as a newly public company, including the increased compensation expenses associated with the purchase of shares of common stock by our employee stock ownership plan and the implementation of stock-based benefit plans, if approved by our stockholders. In addition, we will incur increased noninterest expense related to the implementation of our business strategy related to planned additions to our employee base and potential new loan production office openings. 
 
 Provision for Income Tax Expense (Benefit). During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Bank recorded income tax expense of 146,000, consisting of 133,000 current tax benefit, 64,000 deferred tax expense and 215,000 change in valuation allowance. Federal net operating losses as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are 1.7 million and 1.5 million, respectively, and do not expire. During 2022, management assessed the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated is the cumulative taxable loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2022. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as our projections for future growth. 
 
 On the basis of this evaluation, as of December 31, 2022, a valuation allowance of 150,000 on federal net operating losses has been recorded to recognize only the portion of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted, and an additional valuation allowance recorded, if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is present and additional weight cannot be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth. 
 
 NOL carryforwards for state income tax purposes were approximately 3.9 million and 3.2 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and will begin expiring in 2023. Due to the uncertainty that the Bank will be able to generate future state taxable income sufficient to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards, a full valuation allowance of 371,000 has been recorded on the related deferred tax asset. 
 
 There were no uncertain tax positions outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. As of December 31, 2022, tax years remaining open for State of Illinois and Wisconsin were 2018 through 2021. Federal tax years that remained open were 2019 through 2021. As of December 31, 2022, there were also no unrecognized tax benefits that are expected to significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. 
 
 Exposure to Changes in Interest Rates 
 
 Our ability to maintain net interest income depends upon our ability to earn a higher yield on interest-earning assets than the rates we pay on deposits and borrowings. Our interest-earning assets consist primarily of securities available-for-sale and long-term residential and commercial mortgage loans, which generally have fixed rates of interest. Consequently, our ability to maintain a positive spread between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings will be adversely affected as market rates of interest continue to rise. 
 
 Net Portfolio Value Analysis . Our interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of models which generate estimates of the change in its net portfolio value ("NPV") over a range of interest rate scenarios. NPV represents the market value of portfolio equity, which is different from book value, and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities (that is, the difference between incoming and outgoing discounted cash flows of assets and liabilities) with adjustments made for off-balance sheet items. The NPV ratio, under any interest rate scenario, is defined as the NPV in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario. The OCC provides a quarterly report on the potential impact of interest rate changes upon the market value of portfolio equity. Management reviews the quarterly reports from the OCC, which show the impact of changing interest rates on net portfolio value. The following table sets forth our NPV as of December 31, 2022 and reflects the changes to NPV as a result of immediate and sustained changes in interest rates as indicated.

Net Interest Income Analysis . In addition to modeling changes in NPV, we also analyze potential changes to net interest income NII for a 12-month period under rising and falling interest rate scenarios. The following table shows our NII model as of December 31, 2022.

The table above indicates that as of December 31, 2022, in the event of an immediate and sustained 300 basis point increase in interest rates, our net interest income for the twelve months ending December 31, 2023 would be expected to decrease by 736,000, or 10.3 to 6.4 million. 
 
 Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. The above table assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the date indicated remains constant uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the table provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our NPV and will differ from actual results.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 North Shore Trust and Savings maintains levels of liquid assets deemed adequate by management. We adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows, repay our borrowings, and to fund loan commitments. We also adjust liquidity, as appropriate, to meet asset and liability management objectives. 
 
 Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and proceeds from the sale and maturities of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the FHLB of Chicago and a 10.0 million unsecured Fed Funds facility with BMO Harris Bank. At December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding advances from the FHLB of Chicago and had the capacity to borrow approximately 68.6 million from the FHLB of Chicago. Additionally, we had no outstanding balance with BMO Harris Bank. 
 
 While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. 
 
 Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was 3.0 million and 1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of net change in loans receivable and net change in investment securities, was 44.5 million and 11.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities, consisting primarily of the activity in deposit accounts, proceeds from the issuance of common stock and FHLB of Chicago advances, was (67.0) million and 100.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Time deposits that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2022, totaled 30.6 million. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize FHLB of Chicago advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, North Shore Trust and Savings was well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. During the year ended December 31, 2020, North Shore Trust and Savings elected to begin using the CBLR. Under CBLR, if a qualifying depository institution or depository institution holding company elects to use such measure, such institution or holding company will be considered well capitalized if its ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets (i.e., leverage ratio) exceeds 8 in 2020, 8.5 in 2021 and 9 in 2022, subject to a limited two quarter grace period, during which the leverage ratio cannot go 100 basis points below the then applicable threshold, and will not be required to calculate and report risk-based capital ratios. North Shore Trust and Savings Tier 1 capital to Average Assets was 24.81 and 16.11 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements . At December 31, 2022, we had 793,000 of outstanding commitments to originate loans. Our total letters and lines of credit and unused lines of credit totaled 2.9 million at December 31, 2022.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 
 
 The financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on our performance than does the effect of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services, since such prices are affected by inflation to a larger extent than interest rates. 
 
 Current Accounting Developments 
 
 The following ASU has been issued by the FASB but is not yet effective. 
 
 The FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326) . The ASU introduces a new credit loss model, the current expected credit loss model ("CECL"), which requires earlier recognition of credit losses, while also providing additional transparency about credit risk. 
 
 The CECL model utilizes a lifetime expected credit loss measurement objective for the recognition of credit losses for loans, held-to-maturity securities, and other receivables at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired. The expected credit losses are adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit losses. For available for-sale securities where fair value is less than cost, credit-related impairment, if any, will be recognized in an allowance for credit losses and adjusted each period for changes in expected credit risk. This model replaces the multiple existing impairment models, which generally require that a loss be incurred before it is recognized. 
 
 The CECL model represents a significant change from existing practice and may result in material changes to our accounting for financial instruments. We are evaluating the effect ASU 2016-13 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The impact of the ASU will depend upon the state of the economy, and the nature of our loan portfolio at the date of adoption. The new standard is effective January 1, 2023 for emerging growth companies. 
 
 Management has developed a CECL allowance model which calculates reserves over the life of the loan and is largely driven by peer data adjusted for portfolio characteristics unique to us. Management will periodically refine the model as needed. We expect to incur a 250,000 to 300,000 after-tax charge, during the first quarter of 2023 as a result of the adoption of CECL, which will decrease the opening stockholders equity balance as of January 1, 2023. The total estimated impact equates to a 9 to 12 basis point decrease to the tangible common equity ratio. Management is in the process of finalizing the review of the most recent model run and finalizing assumptions including qualitative adjustments and economic forecasts.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls Procedures 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by NSTS Bancorp, Inc. in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and is accumulated and communicated to NSTS Bancorp, Inc.'s management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Management of NSTS Bancorp, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of published financial statements. Internal control over financial reporting includes self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified. 
 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of NSTS Bancorp, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) . Based on this assessment, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have determined that NSTS Bancorp, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the specified criteria. 
 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes made in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, NSTS Bancorp, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of 
 NSTS Bancorp, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of NSTS Bancorp, Inc. and its Subsidiary (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 The Bank operates primarily in the northern suburbs of Chicago, Illinois. The Bank offers a variety of financial services to customers in the surrounding community. Financial services consist primarily of 1 - 4 family mortgage loans, savings accounts, and certificate of deposit accounts. There are no significant concentrations of loans to any one industry or customer. The Bank s exposure to credit risk is significantly affected by changes in the economy in the Bank s market area. 
 
 All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

 The Employee Retention Credit was recorded during the second quarter of 2022, when the Bank determined it was eligible. The credit is recorded as other non-interest income and offsets of salaries and employee benefits expense previously recorded during 2021. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Bank has received of the Employee Retention Credit, which represents the tax credit for the quarter ended June 30, 2021. The Bank cannot reasonably estimate when it will receive the remaining refunds. A receivable is recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets to reflect the remaining amount of the credit yet to be received. The CARES Act and related Employee Retention Credit was terminated as of September 30, 2021, and therefore the Company does not expect to file for any additional refunds. 

at December 31, 2022 and 2021 and is evaluated for impairment at each reporting date. 

unless mortgage insurance is obtained and generally does not grant loans that would be classified as subprime upon origination. The overall health of the economy, including unemployment rates and housing prices, will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment. 
 
 Although terms for commercial real estate and multi-family residential loans vary, our underwriting standards generally allow for terms not exceeding years and loan-to-value ratios of not more than . Interest rates are typically adjustable, based upon designated market indices such as The Wall Street Journal prime rate, or fixed-rate, and fees are charged to the borrower at the origination of the loan. The actual lives of such loans generally are less than their contractual terms to maturity due to prepayments and re-financings. Generally, we obtain personal guarantees of the principals as additional collateral for commercial real estate and multi-family residential loans. 
 
 Commercial real estate and multi-family residential lending involve a greater degree of risk than one - to four -family residential lending. These risks include larger loans to individual borrowers and loan payments that are dependent upon the successful operation of the project or the borrower s business. These risks can be affected by supply and demand conditions of rental housing units, office and retail space and other commercial space in the project s market area. We attempt to minimize these risks for loans we originate by soliciting loans from businesses with existing operating performance. We also use conservative debt coverage ratios in our underwriting, and periodically monitor the operation of the business or project and the physical condition of the property. 
 
 Consumer Loans 
 Loans in this segment are generally to individuals and are supported by non-real estate collateral, such as deposit accounts and personal property. Unsecured loans are also included in this segment. Repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower or borrowers. 
 
 Allocated Component 
 The allocated component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. Based on internal ratings, loans are evaluated for impairment on a loan-by-loan basis. Impairment is measured by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. An allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. 
 
 A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all circumstances surrounding the loan and borrower, including the length of the delay, reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the amount of principal and interest owed. 
 
 The Bank periodically may agree to modify the contractual terms of loans. When a loan is modified and a concession is made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, the modification is considered a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). All TDRs are classified as impaired and management performs an impairment analysis at the time of restructuring.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , securities were pledged to secure public deposits or for other purposes as required or permitted by law. At December 31, 2022 and 2021 , there were no holdings of securities of any one issuer, other than the U.S. Government and its agencies, in an amount greater than 10 of equity. 
 
 Information pertaining to securities with gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2022 and 2021 , aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position, is as follows: 

U.S. government agency obligations

 Collateralized mortgage obligations 
 Total 
 December 31, 2021 
 U.S. government agency obligations

 Collateralized mortgage obligations 
 Total 

There were no securities with other than temporary impairment losses at December 31, 2022 or 2021 respectively. 
 
 Unrealized losses have not been recognized into income because, based on management s evaluation, the decline in fair value is largely due to increased market rates, temporary market conditions and trading spreads, and, as such, are considered to be temporary by the Bank. In addition, management has the intent and ability to hold these securities until they mature or they recover their carrying values. 
 
 All U.S. Treasuries, U.S. government agency obligations, mortgage-backed residential obligations and collateralized mortgage obligations are agency-issued or government-sponsored enterprise issued. Agency-issued securities are generally guaranteed by a U.S. government agency, such as the Government National Mortgage Association. Government-sponsored enterprises, such as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal National Mortgage Association, or the Small Business Administration, have either a direct or implied guarantee by the U.S. government. 
 
 The Bank holds two classifications of municipal bonds, general obligation bonds and revenue bonds. General obligation bonds are backed by the general revenue of the issuing municipality, while revenue bonds are supported by a specific revenue source. All general obligation and revenue bonds have a bond rating of investment grade by Standard and Poor s or Moody s Investor Services or are not rated. The bonds that are not rated have been in a loss position less than 12 months. As of December 31, 2022, all municipal bond securities are paying as agreed.

The Bank evaluates collectability based on payment activity and other factors. The Bank uses a graded loan rating system as a means of identifying potential problem loans, as follows: 
 
 Pass 
 Loans in these categories are performing as expected with low to average risk. 
 
 Special Mention 
 Loans in this category are internally designated by management as watch loans. These loans are starting to show signs of potential weakness and are closely monitored by management. 
 
 Substandard 
 Loans in this category are internally designated by management as substandard. Generally, a loan is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the paying capacity of the obligors or the current net worth of the collateral pledged. Substandard loans present a distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain losses if such weaknesses are not corrected. 
 
 Doubtful 
 Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those designated as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses may make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, highly questionable and improbable. 
 
 On an annual basis, or more often if needed, the Bank formally reviews the ratings on commercial loans. In addition, the Bank performs an independent review of a significant portion of the commercial loan portfolio. Management uses the results of the independent review as part of its annual review process.

The difference between the income tax expense shown on the statements of income and the amounts computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before income taxes is primarily due to tax-exempt income, the change in valuation allowance, and the adjustment of deferred taxes for enacted changes in tax laws. The provision for income taxes differs from that computed are as follows:

The Bank does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly in the next twelve months. Federal net operating losses (NOL) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are million, and million, respectively, and do not expire. During 2022, management assessed the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated is the cumulative taxable loss incurred over the three -year period ended December 31, 2022. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as our projections for future growth. 
 
 On the basis of this evaluation, as of December 31, 2022, a valuation allowance of on Federal NOLs has been recorded to recognize only the portion of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted, and an additional valuation allowance recorded, if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is present and additional weight cannot be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth. Our projections for growth are based on growth within our deposit and loan portfolios and maintaining an adequate net interest margin. 
 
 NOL carryforwards for state income tax purposes were approximately million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively, and will begin expiring in 2023. Due to the uncertainty that the Bank will be able to generate future state taxable income sufficient to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards, a full valuation allowance of has been recorded on the related deferred tax asset. 
 
 There were uncertain tax positions outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 . As of December 31, 2022 , tax years remaining open for State of Illinois and Wisconsin were 2018 through 2021. Federal tax years that remained open were 2019 through 2021. As of December 31, 2022 , there were also unrecognized tax benefits that are expected to significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.

Failure to exceed the leverage ratio thresholds required under CBLR in the future, subject to any applicable grace period, would require the Company to return to the risk-based capital ratio thresholds previously utilized under the fully phased-in Basel III Capital Rules to determine capital adequacy. 
 
 The Company's principal source of funds for dividend payments is dividends received from the Bank. Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay without prior approval of regulatory agencies. Under these regulations, the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay in any calendar year is limited to the current year's profits, combined with the retained profit of the previous two years, subject to the capital requirements described above which include a requirement that the Bank maintain a capital conservation buffer of on all risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid additional limitations on capital distributions.

Management implemented a 401 (k)-benefit plan during 2007. Employee contributions are matched up to the first of compensation contributed by the employee. Employer match contributions totaled for 2022 and for 2021 . 
 
 As part of the conversion, North Shore Trust and Savings established the Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") for its employees. Shares of the ESOP will be released and allocated to employees based on the ratio of each such participant's compensation. Refer to Note 12 for additional information surrounding the ESOP and related expenses. 

shares of Company common stock in the Company s initial public offering at per share with the proceeds of a twenty-five ) year loan from the Company in the amount of million. The interest rate on the ESOP loan is fixed at . The Bank intends to make annual contributions to the ESOP that at a minimum will permit the ESOP to repay the principal and interest due on the ESOP debt. However, the Bank may prepay the principal of the note, partially or in full and without penalty or premium at any time and from time to time without prior notice to the holder. Any dividends declared on Company common stock held by the ESOP and not allocated to the account of a participant can be used to repay the loan. As the ESOP loan is repaid, shares of Company common stock pledged as collateral for the loan are released from the loan suspense account for allocation to Plan participants on the basis of each active participant s proportional share of compensation. Participants vest in their ESOP allocations after five years of service. In connection with the implementation of the ESOP, participants were given credit for past service with the Bank for vesting purposes. Participants will become fully vested upon death, disability, retirement, a change in control, or termination of the ESOP. Generally, participants will receive distributions from the ESOP upon separation from service. The plan reallocates any unvested shares of common stock forfeited upon termination of employment among the remaining participants in the plan. 
 
 ESOP compensation represents the average fair market value of the shares of Company common stock allocated or committed to be released as of that date. The difference between the market price and the cost of shares committed to be released is recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. Dividends, if any, on allocated shares are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings and dividends, if any, on unallocated shares are recorded as a reduction of the debt service. The ESOP compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was .

Concentrations of Credit Risk 
 The Bank generally originates single-family residential loans within its primary lending area which is Waukegan, Illinois and the surrounding area. The Bank s underwriting policies require such loans to be made at approximately loan-to-value, based upon appraised values, unless private mortgage insurance is obtained, or the loan is guaranteed by the government. These loans are secured by the underlying properties. 
 
 The Bank maintains its cash in deposit accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank or other institutions, the balances of which may exceed federally insured limits. The Bank has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The Bank believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The Bank assumes interest rate risk (the risk that general interest rate levels will change) as a result of its normal operations. As a result, fair values of its financial instruments will change when interest rate levels change, and that change may be either favorable or unfavorable to the Bank. Management attempts to match maturities of assets and liabilities to the extent believed necessary to minimize interest rate risk. However, borrowers with fixed rate obligations are less likely to prepay in a rising rate environment and more likely to prepay in a falling rate environment. Conversely, depositors who are receiving fixed rates are more likely to withdraw funds before maturity in a rising rate environment and less likely to do so in a falling rate environment. Management monitors rates and maturities of assets and liabilities and attempts to minimize interest rate risk by adjusting terms of new loans and deposits and by investing in securities with terms that mitigate the overall interest rate risk. 
 
 Litigation 
 Due to the nature of its business activities, the Bank is at times subject to legal action which arises in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Bank.

Exhibit 4.1 

DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT S SECURITIES 
 REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 
 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 

Our common stock is the only class of our securities that is registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). The following description of our common stock is a summary and does not purport to be complete. It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to our Certificate of Incorporation (the Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws (the Bylaws ), each of which are incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.1 is a part. 

General 

NSTS Bancorp, Inc. is authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of common stock, par value of 0.01 per share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.01 per share. As of December 31, 2022, there are 5,397,959 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. NSTS Bancorp, Inc. has not issued shares of preferred stock. Each share of common stock has the same relative rights as, and is identical in all respects to, each other share of common stock. Upon payment of the subscription price for the common stock, in accordance with the plan of conversion, all of the shares of common stock are duly authorized, fully paid and nonassessable. 

The shares of common stock represent non-withdrawable capital, are not an account of an insurable type, and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. 

Common Stock 

Dividends . NSTS Bancorp, Inc. may pay dividends on its common stock if, after giving effect to such dividends, it would be able to pay its debts in the usual course of business and its total assets would exceed the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount needed to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of stockholders whose preferential rights on dissolution are superior to those receiving the dividends. However, even if NSTS Bancorp, Inc. s assets are less than the amount necessary to satisfy the requirement set forth above, NSTS Bancorp, Inc. may pay dividends from: its net earnings for the fiscal year in which the distribution is made; and its net earnings for the preceding fiscal year. The payment of dividends by NSTS Bancorp, Inc. is also subject to limitations that are imposed by applicable regulation, including restrictions on payments of dividends that would reduce NSTS Bancorp, Inc. s net assets below the then-adjusted balance of its liquidation account. The holders of common stock of NSTS Bancorp, Inc. are entitled to receive and share equally in dividends as may be declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. If NSTS Bancorp, Inc. issues shares of preferred stock, the holders thereof may have priority over the holders of the common stock with respect to dividends. 

Voting Rights . The holders of common stock of NSTS Bancorp, Inc. have exclusive voting rights in NSTS Bancorp, Inc. They elect NSTS Bancorp, Inc. s board of directors and act on other matters as are required to be presented to them under Delaware law or as are otherwise presented to them by the board of directors. Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote per share and do not have any right to cumulate votes in the election of directors. Any person who beneficially owns more than 10 of the then-outstanding shares of NSTS Bancorp, Inc. s common stock, is not entitled or permitted to vote any shares of common stock held in excess of the 10 limit. If NSTS Bancorp, Inc. issues shares of preferred stock, holders of the preferred stock may also possess voting rights. Certain matters require the approval of 75 of our outstanding voting stock as described in our Certificate of Incorporation. 

As a federally-chartered stock savings association, corporate powers and control of North Shore Trust and Savings are vested in its board of directors, who elect the officers of North Shore Trust and Savings and who fill any vacancies on the board of directors. Voting rights of North Shore Trust and Savings are vested exclusively in the owners of the shares of capital stock of North Shore Trust and Savings, which is NSTS Bancorp, Inc., and voted at the direction of NSTS Bancorp, Inc. s board of directors. Consequently, the holders of the common stock of NSTS Bancorp, Inc. do not have direct control of North Shore Trust and Savings. 

Liquidation . In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of North Shore Trust and Savings, NSTS Bancorp, Inc., as the holder of 100 of North Shore Trust and Savings capital stock, would be entitled to receive all assets of North Shore Trust and Savings available for distribution, after payment or provision for payment of all debts and liabilities of North Shore Trust and Savings, including all deposit accounts and accrued interest thereon, and after distribution of the balance in the liquidation account to eligible account holders and supplemental eligible account holders. In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of NSTS Bancorp, Inc., the holders of its common stock would be entitled to receive, after payment or provision for payment of all its debts and liabilities (including payments with respect to its liquidation account to all eligible account holders and supplemental eligible account holders), all of the assets of NSTS Bancorp, Inc. available for distribution. If preferred stock is issued, the holders thereof may have a priority over the holders of the common stock in the event of a liquidation or dissolution. 

Preemptive Rights . Holders of the common stock of NSTS Bancorp, Inc. are not entitled to preemptive rights with respect to any shares that may be issued. The common stock is not subject to redemption. 

Preferred Stock 

None of the shares of NSTS Bancorp, Inc. s authorized preferred stock are issued. Preferred stock may be issued with preferences and designations as our board of directors may from time to time determine. Our board of directors may, without stockholder approval, issue shares of preferred stock with voting, dividend, liquidation and conversion rights that could dilute the voting strength of the holders of common stock and may assist management in impeding an unfriendly takeover or attempted change in control. 

Listing 

Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol NSTS . 

Transfer Agent 

The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Pacific Stock Transfer.
