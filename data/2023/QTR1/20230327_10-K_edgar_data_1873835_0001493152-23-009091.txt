surveys, market research, consultant surveys, publicly available information, reports of governmental agencies and industry publications,
articles and surveys. Industry surveys, publications, consultant surveys and forecasts generally state that the information contained
therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed.
While we believe that such studies and publications are reliable, we have not independently verified market and industry data from third-party
sources. 

RISK
FACTOR SUMMARY 

Our
business is subject to significant risks and uncertainties that make an investment in us speculative and risky. Below we summarize what
we believe are the principal risk factors but these risks are not the only ones we face, and you should carefully review and consider
the full discussion of our risk factors in the section titled Risk Factors, together with the other information in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occurs (or if any of those listed elsewhere in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K occur), our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, revenue, and future prospects could be seriously
harmed. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important
factors that adversely affect our business. 

Risks
Relating to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs 

We
 have incurred substantial losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial and increasing losses
 for the foreseeable future. 

We
 need significant additional financing to fund our operations and complete the development and, if approved, the commercialization
 of our product candidates. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product
 development programs or commercialization efforts. 

Raising
 additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to
 our product candidates on unfavorable terms to us. 

4 

Risks
Relating to the Development and Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates 

We
 have a limited number of product candidates, all which are still in early clinical or pre-clinical development. If we do not obtain
 regulatory approval of one or more of our product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be
 materially adversely affected. 

Clinical
 trials are expensive, time consuming, difficult to design and implement, and involve uncertain outcomes. Results of previous pre-clinical
 studies and clinical trials may not be predictive of future results, and the results of our current and planned clinical trials may
 not satisfy the requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities. 

We
 may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials given the limited number of patients who have the diseases for which
 our product candidates are being studied which could delay or prevent the start of clinical trials for our product candidates. 

Our
 product candidates may have undesirable side effects that may delay or prevent marketing approval or, if approval is received, require
 them to be taken off the market, require them to include safety warnings or otherwise limit their sales. 

We
 are dependent on third parties for manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates. If we are not able to secure favorable
 arrangements with such third parties or the third parties upon whom we rely do not perform, including failure to perform to our specifications
 or comply with applicable regulations, our business and financial condition could be harmed. 

If
 any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval, the approved products may not achieve broad market acceptance among physicians,
 patients, the medical community and third-party payors, in which case revenue generated from their sales would be limited. 

Even
 if we receive regulatory approval to commercialize any of the product candidates that we develop, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory
 obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. 

If
 any product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit
 commercialization of our product candidates. 

Current
 and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product
 candidates and affect the prices we may obtain for such product candidates. If we fail to comply with regulations, we could face
 substantial enforcement actions, including civil and criminal penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could
 be adversely affected. 

Risks
Relating to our Business and Operations 

If
 the market opportunities for our current and potential future product candidates are smaller than we believe they are, our ability
 to generate product revenue may be adversely affected and our business may suffer. 

Our
 products will face significant competition, and if they are unable to compete successfully, our business will suffer. 

Any
 international operations we undertake may subject us to risks inherent with operations outside of the United States. 

Risks
Relating to our Intellectual Property 

We
 may be subject to claims that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged
 trade secrets. 

Our
 intellectual property may not be sufficient to protect our product candidates from competition, which may negatively affect our business.
 We may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patents and other intellectual property
 rights. 

We
conduct certain research and development operations through our Australian wholly-owned subsidiary. If we lose our ability to operate
in Australia, or if our subsidiary is unable to receive the research and development tax credit allowed by Australian regulations, our
business and results of operations could suffer. 

Risks
Related to Owning our Common Stock 

We
 are currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. If we are unable to maintain listing of our securities on Nasdaq or any stock
 exchange, our stock price could be adversely affected and the liquidity of our stock and our ability to obtain financing could be
 impaired and it may be more difficult for our stockholders to sell their securities. 

Because
 certain of our stockholders control a significant number of shares of our common stock, they may have effective control over actions
 requiring stockholder approval. 

We
 do not intend to pay cash dividends on our shares of common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our shares.

ITEM
1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

Immix
Biopharma, Inc. has the following two business units: 

ImmixBio .
ImmixBio is focused on developing Tissue Specific Therapeutics targeting solid tumors and immune-dysregulated diseases. As of February
2023, 19 patients with advanced solid tumors were treated with IMX-110, ImmixBio s lead candidate. 

Nexcella .
Our majority-owned subsidiary, Nexcella, Inc. (formerly known as Immix Biopharma Cell Therapy, Inc.), is engaged in the discovery and development of novel cell therapies for hematologic
malignancies (blood cancers) and other indications. As of February 2023, 42 patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (90 
overall response rate at therapeutic dose) and 5 relapsed/refractory light chain (AL) amyloidosis patients (100 organ response,
100 complete response rate) have been treated with next-generation CAR-T NXC-201. 

IMMIXBIO
 TISSUE SPECIFIC THERAPEUTICS FOR SOLID TUMORS 

Overview
of ImmixBio 

We
are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a novel class of Tissue-Specific Therapeutics TSTx TM in
oncology and inflammation. Our lead asset, IMX-110, is currently in Phase 1b/2a clinical trials for solid tumors in the United States
and Australia. IMX-110 is a negatively-charged TSTx that simultaneously disables resistance pathways with a poly-kinase inhibitor (which
inhibits multiple kinases simultaneously) and induces tumor cell death with an apoptosis inducer (which activates apoptosis, a non-inflammatory
programmed cell death pathway), leveraging our TME Normalization TM Technology, delivered deep into the tumor micro-environment TME ). Our proprietary System Multi-Action RegulaTors SMAR x T Tissue-Specific TM Platform produces
drugs that accumulate at intended therapeutic sites at 3-5 times the rate of conventional medicines. Our TME Normalization Technology
allows our drug candidates to circulate in the bloodstream, exit through tumor blood vessels and simultaneously attack all components
of the TME. To date, we have not generated any revenues. Since inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing
product and technology rights, conducting research and development, organizing and staffing our Company, business planning and raising
capital. 

Pipeline 

Our
SMAR x T Tissue-Specific TM Platform has produced 3 drug candidates which we believe derisks the clinical development
of each subsequent candidate due to shared design elements across tolerability, chemistry, manufacturing and controls, regulatory understanding,
and multi-target therapeutic approach, the first of which is IMX-110, currently in Phase 1b/2a oncology clinical trials.

Our
Lead Product Candidate 

IMX-110,
currently in Phase 1b/2a clinical trials, is a Tissue-Specific Therapeutic TM with TME Normalization TM , a technology
that we are developing initially for soft tissue sarcoma STS ). Tumor growth is sustained by hypoxia (low oxygen concentration)
and acidosis (an excessively acidic condition) which produce recurring waves of activation of multiple kinases that upregulate NF- B,
STAT3 and other key transcriptional factors which cause recurrent inflammation. This inflammatory environment activates the TME to provide
metabolic and structural support to the tumor and to recruit Treg T-cells (immune cells suppressing immune response) to suppress anti-tumor
immune response. IMX-110 s poly-kinase inhibitor polyphenol curcuminoid complex PCC halts this fundamental tumor-sustaining
inflammation by blocking multiple kinases and interfering with NF- B and STAT3 activation, interrupting the positive feedback loop
underlying the inflammatory cycle. With tumor-sustaining inflammation halted, IMX-110 s apoptosis inducer (Polyethylene glycol
 phosphatidylethanolamine PEG-PE )-doxorubicin complex) is then able to induce tumor cell death where conventional
therapies have been hampered by resistance caused by NF- B and STAT3 activation. 

As
of February 2023, we have treated the first 2 patients in our ongoing Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of IMX-110 + Novartis/BeiGene anti-PD-1
Tislelizumab. 

As
of February 2023, we have treated 17 patients in our ongoing Phase 1b/2a clinical trial in the United States and Australia. 100 of these
patients received between 3 and 13 lines of therapy prior to IMX-110. Zero drug-related serious adverse events and zero dose interruptions
due to toxicity have been observed in our 1b/2a clinical trial to-date. In our trial, we observed radiological progression-free-survival
of 6 months in 50 of our STS patients, with a 4-month median progression free survival mPFS across all STS patients.
mPFS is the time that patients live without their cancer progressing. The trial includes patients with leiomyosarcoma, carcinosarcoma,
poorly differentiated soft tissue sarcoma, cholangiocarcinoma, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, esophageal cancer,
breast cancer, and nasopharyngeal cancer. 

In
August 2021, we entered into a Clinical Collaboration and Supply Agreement with BeiGene Ltd. BeiGene for a combination
Phase 1b clinical trial in solid tumors of IMX-110 and anti-PD-1 Tislelizumab (the subject of a collaboration and license agreement among
BeiGene and Novartis). In genetic mouse models of pancreatic cancer, IMX-110 has demonstrated an immunomodulation effect, turning cold 
tumors hot, and, in combination with murine anti-PD-1, IMX-110 produced extended survival versus multi-drug combinations.
The goal of this study is to demonstrate the potential for TSTx to be an integral component of combination therapies for a wide range
of advanced solid tumors. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we and BeiGene shall form a committee made up of an equal number
of individuals, but not more than two representatives of each of our Company and BeiGene, which shall, among other things, coordinate
activities with respect to the trial; provided, however, we shall be entitled to receive, review or approve any budgets or other costs
relating to the trial. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we shall be responsible for all costs associated with the manufacturing
and supply of IMX-110 for the trial as well as all costs associated with conducting the trial and BeiGene shall be responsible for costs
associated with supplying Tislelizumab for the trial. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Tislelizumab supplied by BeiGene is lost,
damaged or destroyed or becomes unable to comply with applicable specifications while under our control, BeiGene shall not be required
to replace such Tislelizumab and in the event BeiGene replaces such Tislelizumab, it may charge us a reasonable replacement cost. The
agreement shall continue until the earlier of (i) the one year anniversary of the date upon which we provide BeiGene with the trial s
final clinical study report and (ii) the date of termination of the trial. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement (i)
upon 30 days prior written notice to the other party if, in the case of our Company, we cease the development of IMX-110 or, in the case
of BeiGene, it ceases the development, marketing and sale of Tislelizumab, (ii) upon written notice to the other party if there have
been one or more serious adverse events indicating a patient safety issue with continuing the trial, (iii) upon written notice to the
other party if a regulatory authority withdraws approval of IMX-110 or Tislelizumab, as applicable, and/or the trial, (iv) upon 60 days 
notice to the other party with or without reason, (v) immediately upon written notice to the other party if such other party consummates
a Change of Control Transaction (as defined in the agreement) and/or (vi) upon written notice to the other party in the event such other
party is in material breach of the agreement and has not cured such breach within 60 days after receipt of notice from the non-breaching
party. As of the date hereof, we have not paid any amounts to BeiGene. 

In
September 2021, the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation ODD to IMX-110 for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. If a product that has ODD subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease
for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA
may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for 7 years (except in limited circumstances,
such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity). 

In
January 2022, the FDA granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation RPDD to IMX-110 for the treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma,
a life-threatening pediatric cancer in children. RPDD qualifies us to receive fast track review and a priority review voucher PRV at the time of marketing approval of IMX-110.

Our
Other Product Candidates 

IMX-111
is a Tissue-Specific Biologic TM built on our TME Normalization TM Technology with proprietary GLUT1 antibody biomarker
targeting coupled with our poly-kinase inhibitor / apoptosis inducer. IMX-111 takes advantage of the fact that GLUT1 is an essential
cancer biomarker that is overexpressed on 92 of colorectal cancer cells and other tumor types. Furthermore, the degree of its overexpression
correlates with more advanced stages of tumor progression. Building on the well-tolerated profile of our lead candidate from our ongoing
clinical trial, we believe IMX-111 is the first cancer therapeutic to be developed that takes advantage of GLUT1 overexpression in cancer. 

IMX-120
is a Tissue-Specific Biologic TM built on our Immune Normalization Technology TM for inflammatory bowel disease with
proprietary GLUT1 antibody biomarker targeting coupled with polyphenol poly-kinase inhibitors. IMX-120 takes advantage of the fact that
overexpression and activation of GLUT1 on overactive immune cells has been shown to be widely present in patients with inflammatory bowel
diseases IBD ). Similar to tumor growth, the inflammatory processes active in IBD are caused by recurring waves of activation
of multiple kinases that upregulate NF- B, STAT3 and other key transcriptional factors. IMX-120 s polyphenol poly-kinase
inhibitors block upstream kinase signal transduction systems that activate NF- B and STAT3. GLUT1 presents an ideal targeting moiety
(component of a drug) for these overactive immune cells, allowing for tissue-specific delivery of IMX-120.

Our
SMAR x T Tissue-Specific Platform consists of 3 pillars: first, System-Tissue Biology Model Development, which allows us to
develop robust mechanisms of action in complex pathologies; second, Purpose-Built Physical Biochemistry Engine, which allows us to generate
actionable drug candidates; and third, Predictive Valuation Framework, which allows us to conduct highly predictive IND-enabling activities.

Figure
3: SMARxT Tissue-Specific TM Platform Overview 

Specifically,
the 3 pillars of our platform are: 

1)
 System-Tissue Biology Model Development : Interplay of cellular elements define and drive disease states. Based on transcriptional
and epigenetic factors operating in key cell types, we have built a proprietary model of network motifs driving human pathologies such
as cancer and auto-immune/inflammatory diseases. We believe this model represents the most complete view of biologic interrelationships
on an organismal and tissue level. We apply this model in the early stages of our drug development to overcome systemic factors that
have prevented traditional targeted therapies effectiveness in complex pathologies such as cancer and inflammatory
bowel disease. 

2)
 Purpose-Built Physical Biochemistry Engine : Traditional drug development focuses on one drug, one target approach.
In contrast, our proprietary physical biochemistry engine is designed to incorporate wide-ranging elements into our drug design, encompassing
a diverse target profile, allowing our drugs to operate simultaneously in time and space to jointly combat disease at the tissue and
organismal level. 

3)
 Predictive Validation Framework : Using our unique relationships and our internal expertise, we have developed a proprietary framework
of high-efficiency, rapid development in vitro and in vivo animal models that have high relatability to human disease,
minimizing the traditional poor predictive value of animal models. 

The
application of the SMAR x T Tissue-Specific Platform in oncology is TME Normalization TM Technology, and in inflammation
is Immune Normalization TM Technology.

Figure
4: TME Normalization TM Technology 

The
TME is made up of a tightly packed mass of: 1) cancer associated fibroblasts CAFs ), 2) tumor-associated macrophages/immune
cells TAMs ), and 3) cancer itself. The TME s unique biophysical properties include regions of varying degrees of
hypoxia, acidosis and an immunosuppressive milieu. As cancer cells outgrow their blood supply, the resulting hypoxia and acidosis shift
their metabolism towards glycolysis, lactate and lipids. This, in turn, shapes the responses of proximal fibroblasts and resident immune
cells. Fibroblasts begin to secrete lactate that is taken up by nearby cancer cells and consumed as fuel. Lactate in the TME reprograms
the macrophages toward the M2 tolerant pro-inflammatory phenotype that drives immunosuppression. At the same time, the
TME hypoxia produces increased levels of reactive oxygen species that enhance tumorigenicity (tendency to form tumors) and immunosuppressive
functions of Treg T-cells, as well as resistance to immune drugs such as PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Our TME Normalization TM Technology
reverses the hypoxia- and acidosis-activated genetic programs in every cellular component of the TME, normalizing the TME,
and reactivating apoptosis cell death pathways. This technology offers an attractive opportunity to reshape the pathological niche that
is the TME and overcome the critical factors that have hampered available treatments to date.

Figure
5: Representation of the TME Composed of CAFs, TAMs, and Cancer Cells 

Our
TME Normalization TM Technology causes tumor apoptosis, a non-inflammatory tumor-cell death (instead of necroptosis, which
results in repeat reignition of the inflammatory cascade leading to tumor progression). Thus, when the inflammatory cascade is inhibited,
tumor resistance can be suppressed, enabling tumor cell apoptosis by ImmixBio therapies. 

We
believe that our TME Normalization TM Technology is a promising direction of research that may enable a new generation of high-therapeutic
index drugs (drugs that have high relative safety as defined by the ratio of toxic to effective dose), unlocking additional therapeutic
benefit without adding toxicity. 

IMX-110
- Tissue-Specific Therapeutic TM with TME Normalization TM Technology 

IMX-110
Market Opportunity 

The
first potential indication we intend to pursue for IMX-110 is STS. STSs are cancers that arise from muscle, fat, nerves, fibrous tissues,
blood vessels or deep skin tissues. Globally, there are roughly 116,000 new cases of soft tissue sarcomas each year, of which 21,500
are in the European Union and 40,500 are in China. According to American Cancer Society, there were roughly 13,000 new cases of soft
tissue sarcomas in the United States during 2020 and about 13,400 new cases of soft tissue sarcomas in the United States are anticipated
in 2023. Approximately 160,000 people live with soft tissue cancers in the United States. The five-year survival rate for all stages
of STS is 65.4 in the United States, but this falls to 17.1 for patients with late-stage metastatic disease. 

The
global soft tissue sarcoma market is estimated to reach approximately 6.5 billion by 2030 from the estimated 2.9 billion in 2019. Drugs
used to treat STS include conventional doxorubicin, eribulin (marketed as Halaven , by Eisai Co, Ltd), pazopanib (marketed as Votrient ,
by Novartis), and trabectedin (marketed as Yondelis , by Janssen/Johnson Johnson). 

844
million is the total publicly disclosed combined annual sales of eribulin (Halaven ), pazopanib (Votrient ), and trabectedin
(Yondelis according to the most recent available annual reports. 

Objective
response rates are increasingly considered as poor surrogates of clinical activity in STS. Therefore, lack of progression, or progression
free survival PFS ), is used as the primary measure of treatment success in STS. 

11 

Conventional
doxorubicin, in three separate studies as a first-line therapy, produced a mPFS (meaning the time patients live without their cancer
progressing) in STS patients of 2.5 months, 4.6 months, and 2.7 months according to Lorigan et al., 2007, Judson et al., 2014 and Chawla
et al., 2015. 

Eribulin
(Halaven ), was trialed in a study in which 50 of patients received three or more lines of previous chemotherapy prior to eribulin.
Eribulin produced a mPFS in STS patients of 2.6 months according to Sch ffski et al., 2016. 

Pazopanib
(Votrient ), was trialed in a study in which 21 of patients received three or more lines of treatment prior to pazopanib. Pazopanib
produced a mPFS in STS patients of 4.6 months according to van der Graaf et al., 2012. 

Trabectedin
(Yondelis was trialed in a study in which 12 of patients received three or more lines of chemotherapy prior to trabectedin. Trabectedin
produced a mPFS in STS patients of 4.2 months according to Demetri et al., 2016. 

IMX-110
Clinical Data 

As
of March 2023, we have treated 17 patients in our ongoing Phase 1b/2a clinical trial in the United States and Australia, of which 8 patients
completed a tumor measurement after the enrollment measurement. Of those 8 patients, a range of late-stage STSs were represented, including:
leiomyosarcoma, cholangiocarcinoma, carcinosarcoma, and poorly differentiated sarcoma. 

4
months was the mPFS observed in STS patients treated with IMX-110 in the United States in our ongoing Phase 1b/2a clinical trial. 

6
months of radiological PFS was observed in 50 of our STS patients treated with IMX-110. 

100 
of these patients received between 3 and 13 lines of therapy prior to IMX-110. 

Zero
drug-related serious adverse events and zero dose interruptions due to toxicity have been observed in our 1b/2a clinical trial to-date.

 time of enrollment (312mm diameter across 5 target lesions). 

- 
 A
 77 year old male STS patient with 8 lines of prior therapy experienced 4 month PFS. 

- 
 A
 27 year old female STS patient with 3 lines of prior therapy experienced 4 month clinical PFS and 6 month radiological PFS.

In
addition to IMX-110 STS data, a colorectal cancer patient originally considered for hospice, was subsequently treated with IMX-110 for
10 months with zero serious drug-related adverse events. This patient experienced 4 month PFS on half of what we expect to be IMX-110 s
recommended Phase 2 therapeutic dose.

Development Strategy 

Figure

We
plan to treat an additional 30 STS patients in our Phase 2a trial with IMX-110 as a first-line therapy. 

We
expect our Phase 2a trial to require around 24 months after the first patient is dosed in 2023. The basis for IMX-110 as a first-line
therapy in STS is threefold: 

- 
 encouraging
 clinical trial mPFS (4 month mPFS) data and tolerability data in our IMX-110 Phase 1b dose escalation trial; 

- 
 we
 have identified precedent FDA clinical trial design for a first-line treatment; and 

- 
 interest
 from leading STS PIs. 

Subsequently,
we plan to initiate an 80 patient Phase 2b/3 clinical trial.

IMX-110
is a negatively-charged Tissue-Specific Therapeutic TM built on our TME Normalization TM Technology encapsulating
a synergistic 5:1 ratio of poly-kinase inhibitor (PCC) and apoptosis inducer (PEG-PE doxorubicin complex) delivered deep into the TME. 

IMX-110
is the first clinical-stage drug built on our TME Normalization TM Technology.

IMX-110
is 14-16 nanometers in diameter, and is about the size of an Immunoglobulin G IgG antibody. Tumor blood vessels have
perforations of several hundred nanometers in diameter. Once IMX-110 has exited the bloodstream toward the tumor, it must traverse the
fibrous extracellular matrix, laid down by CAFs, that encases and scaffolds the tumor. IMX-110 s small size enables IMX-110 to
exit perforated tumor blood vessels and penetrate the fibrous extracellular matrix.

 female mice (7 weeks old) at a volume of 0.1 ml/10g body weight. After defined time periods (15 min, 1, 4, 24, and 48 h), mice
were anesthetized with diethylether and tumor samples were collected. Adapted from Yokoyama, et al., 1999. We did not fund or sponsor
this study, and we were not involved in this study or its publication.) 

We
believe IMX-110 s negative charge enables it to be electrostatically attracted to the tumor, and accumulate at tumor sites at a
rate 4-9 times higher than the rate of existing standard of care chemotherapies such as conventional doxorubicin. 

Figure
14: IMX-110 12x Tumor Killing vs. Conventional Doxorubicin 

(See
below paragraph for study description. Adapted from Sarisozen, et al., 2016) 

We
observed that IMX-110 has statistically significantly increased apoptosis in 3D spheroid U87MG glioblastoma model as measured by increase
in caspase 3/7 activity after 24 hours versus groups treated with: control group (empty micelles), 0.1 M free doxorubicin (free DOX),
0.1 M micellular doxorubicin (DOX micelles), 20 M micellular curcumin (CUR micelles). The primary endpoint of the study was level
of apoptosis as measured by increase in caspase 3/7 activity after 24 hours of treatment. 3D Spheroid U87MG glioblastoma cells were treated
with 0.1 M DOX and 20 M CUR in micellar formulations for 24 h, followed by the Apo-ONE Homogeneous Caspase-3/7 Assay. Results
were normalized against the control group and presented as mean SD. Our employees were involved in the design of this study
and Ilya Rachman, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors, was a co-author of the results published in 2016.
Results were generated in triplicate using 15 spheroids per treatment. 

IMX-110 s
synergistic combination induces caspase 3/7 activity, a proxy for apoptosis/tumor cell killing, at a rate of 12 times higher than that
of conventional doxorubicin, and at a rate 5 times higher than micellular doxorubicin, confirming IMX-110 s potent tumor cell killing
activity.

 Intracellular
Mechanism of Action 

Specifically,
IMX-110 induces potent tumor killing by blocking multiple tumor escape pathways targeted by FDA approved targeted agents and targeted
agents in development. 

Leveraging
its multi-kinase inhibition capabilities, not only does IMX-110 block activation of NF- B and STAT3, IMX-110 also simultaneously
blocks activation of other well-known cancer-related proteins such as COX2, BCL2, BCL-xL, Survivin, c-myc, Notch, and Hes1. With these
pathways shut down, IMX-110 is able to activate apoptosis through double-stranded DNA breaks caused by IMX-110 s apoptosis inducer
(PEG-PE doxorubicin complex).

Pre-clinical Data 

We
have funded and sponsored pre-clinical experiments to characterize the activity profile of IMX-110 in a range of solid tumor models,
including genetic KPC pancreatic mouse model, xenograft mouse models of various cancers, and in vitro with various cancer cell
lines. 

We
observed that IMX-110 has statistically significantly inhibited tumor growth in a pre-clinical study that we funded and was
conducted on an industry sponsored research basis in a HCT-116 colon cancer xenograft mouse model (which is poorly sensitive to
doxorubicin). The primary endpoint of the study was tumor growth inhibition as measured by tumor volume, with the secondary endpoint
being overall survival. Female nude (NU/NU) mice bearing 250mm 3 HCT-116 tumors were treated every 2 days starting at day
0 (7 total tail vein injections, arrows correspond to injection days) at a dose of 4 mg/kg CUR and 0.4 mg/kg DOX (six mice per
dosing group). Survival was determined when the tumor reached 1000mm 3 . Our employees were involved in the design of this
study and Ilya Rachman, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors, was a co-author of the results published
in 2013. No adverse side effects of IMX-110 were observed as measured by lack of weight loss.

In
this pre-clinical study of IMX-110 in the HCT-116 colorectal cancer xenograft mouse model, at day 24, 80 of mice treated with 1 cycle
of low-dose IMX-110 were alive while all control animals were dead. 

We
observed that IMX-110 monotherapy has statistically significantly inhibited tumor growth in a pre-clinical study that we funded and
was conducted in a genetic pancreatic cancer (KPC) mouse model. The primary endpoint of the study was tumor growth inhibition as
measured by tumor volume and weight. Transgenic mice (Pdx1-Cre) were treated every day starting at day 0 (5 total tail vein
injections, arrows correspond to injection days) at a dose of 6 mg/kg CUR and 1.4 mg/kg DOX (at least six mice per dosing group).
Survival was determined when the tumor reached 1500mm 3 . Surviving animals were euthanized after the last blood collection
prior to Day 30, tumors were excised, measured, weighted, photographed and sectioned for histological analysis. Our employees were
involved in the design of this study and the results are unpublished. No adverse side effects of IMX-110 were observed as measured
by lack of weight loss.

In
published literature, the effect of a combination of murine anti-PD-1, gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel, and murine anti-CD40 was studied
in a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (KPC), and produced median survival of 42 days. 

The
primary endpoint of the study was tumor growth inhibition as measured by tumor volume and weight. Mice were treated intraperitoneally
(i.p.) with murine anti-PD-1 (RMP1-14; BioXcell; 200 mg/dose) on days 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 (after enrollment), with chemotherapy
(gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel) injected i.p. at 120 mg/kg (for each chemotherapeutic) on day 1, and agonistic anti-CD40 (FGK45; BioXcell;
100 mg injected on day 3. For isotype controls, rat IgG2a (2A3; BioXcell; 100 mg) and rat IgG2b (LTF-2; BioXcell; 200 mg/dose) were used
(6-8 mice per group). Duration of survival was studied. We did not fund or sponsor this study, and we were not involved in this study
or its publication.

Market Opportunity 

The
first potential indication we intend to pursue for IMX-111 is colorectal cancer CRC ). CRCs are cancers that arise from
the colon, rectum and anus. According to American Cancer Society, there were roughly 153,020 new cases of colorectal cancer in the United
States in 2023. Globally, there are roughly 1,930,000 new cases of colorectal cancer each year, of which 519,500 are in Europe, 148,500
are in Japan, 20,500 are in Australia and New Zealand, and 555,000 are in China. The five-year survival rate in the United States for
all stages of CRC is 65.1 , but this falls to 15.1 for patients with late-stage metastatic disease. 

The
colorectal cancer market is estimated to reach approximately 31.2 billion by 2025 from the estimated 26.3 billion in 2019. Drugs used
to treat CRC include conventional irinotecan, oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, pembrolizumab (marketed as Keytruda , by Merck Co.),
nivolumab (marketed as Opdivo , by Bristol Meyers Squibb), bevacizumab (marketed as Avastin , by Roche), and ramucirumab (marketed
as Cyramza , by Eli Lilly). 

41.11
billion is the total publicly disclosed combined annual sales of pembrolizumab (Keytruda , Merck Co.), nivolumab (Opdivo ),
bevacizumab (Avastin ), and ramucirumab (Cyramza according to the most recent available annual reports. 

25 

However,
these therapies are either approved in combination with chemotherapies, or in a small subset of colorectal cancer patients.

distant, and other staging, and includes approximately 63 of all patients newly diagnosed with CRC annually. Treatment of aCRC typically
involves removal of sections of the colon (colectomy) or rerouting of the intestine by colostomy. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy, including
the above drugs, are also used to treat aCRC patients.

the secondary endpoint being overall survival. Female nude (NU/NU) mice bearing 150mm 3 MDA-MB-231 tumors were treated
every 2 days starting at day 20 except last injection administered at day 33 (7 total IV injections) at a dose of 6 mg/kg CUR and 1
mg/kg DOX (at least six mice per dosing group). Survival was determined when the tumor reached 1000mm 3 . Our employees
were involved in the design of this study and Ilya Rachman, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors, was
a co-author of the results published in 2014. No adverse side effects of IMX-111 were observed as measured by lack of weight
loss.

In
this pre-clinical study of IMX-111 in the MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer xenograft mouse model, treatment with one cycle of
low-dose IMX-111 resulted in 50 reduction in tumor mass, versus 33 growth in controls. The IMX-111 treatment effect lasted throughout
the 52 day experiment duration.

 for
CRC 

IMX-111
is a Tissue-Specific Biologic TM built on our TME Normalization TM Technology with proprietary GLUT1 antibody biomarker
targeting facilitating preferential accumulation in glucose-consuming cancer cells such as CRC. IMX-111 takes advantage of the fact that
GLUT1 is an essential cancer biomarker that is overexpressed on 92 of colorectal cancer tumor cells and other tumor types. Furthermore,
the degree of its overexpression correlates with more advanced stage of tumor progression. IMX-111 is the first cancer therapeutic to
take advantage of this fact by coupling anti-GLUT1 antibody to our poly-kinase inhibitor / apoptosis inducer. 

IMX-111
is 17-23 nanometers in diameter, which is just larger than the size of an IgG antibody.

GLUT1
is a glucose transporter which is overexpressed on 92 of CRC, making GLUT1 a prime biomarker for IMX-111 targeting in CRC.

(Adapted
from Shen, et al., 2011 and Haber, et al., 1998. Shen, et al.: Expression of GLUT1 in 163 primary patient colorectal cancer tumors was
examined using real-time PCR. Haber, et al.: GLUT1 glucose transporter immunostaining was studied in normal colon and benign colon adenomas
and in 112 colorectal carcinomas from patients with known clinical outcomes. We did not fund or sponsor these studies, and we were not
involved in these studies or their publication.) 

GLUT1
overexpression in CRC correlates with advanced, later stage (stage III-IV) disease. Heavy GLUT1 staining is observed in cancerous colorectal
tissue versus healthy normal colon. 

Figure
27: IMX-111 Tissue-Specific Biologic TM with TME Normalization TM Technology 

 Intracellular
Mechanism of Action 

Once
IMX-111 enters the TME, consisting of: 1) CAFs, 2) TAMs/immune cells, and 3) cancer itself, it binds to its GLUT1 biomarker target and
empties its poly-kinase inhibitor / apoptosis inducer payload into these cells, causing tumor apoptosis. Specifically, IMX-111 induces
potent tumor killing by blocking multiple tumor escape pathways targeted by FDA approved targeted agents and targeted agents in development
(see Table 1). 

IMX-111
Development Strategy 

We
plan to conduct IND-enabling studies for IMX-111 in 2023 (completing in in the first half 2024), pursuing advanced colorectal cancer
as the initial indication. We anticipate filing an IND for IMX-111 in in the first half 2024. We plan to initiate a Phase 1b/2a study
with IMX-111 in solid tumors in the United States and Australia, with the first patient anticipated to be dosed in 2024. We plan for
IMX-111 to pursue advanced colorectal cancer as its initial indication.

IMX-120
Tissue-Specific Biologic TM with Immune Normalization Technology TM for inflammatory bowel disease 

IMX-120
Market Opportunity 

The
first potential indications we intend to pursue for IMX-120 are ulcerative colitis UC and severe Crohn s disease CD ), which are both forms of inflammatory bowel disease IBD ). IBD is estimated to affect over 2,000,000
people in the United States and over 5,000,000 people globally. IBD is a complex gastrointestinal disease caused primarily by a dysregulated
immune system. 

Drugs
used to treat IBD include adalimumab (marketed as Humira , by Abbvie), ustekinumab (marketed as Stelara , by Janssen/Johnson
 Johnson), and vedolizumab (marketed as Entyvio , by Takeda). 

36.27
billion is the total publicly disclosed combined annual sales of adalimumab (Humira ), ustekinumab (Stelara ), and vedolizumab
(Entyvio , Takeda) according to the most recent available annual reports. 

Endpoints
for clinical trials in IBD are measured in terms of remission rates at 4-8 weeks post treatment. 

For
adalimumab (Humira ), in a study of moderate-to-severe UC who received concurrent treatment with oral corticosteroids or immunosuppressants,
overall rates of clinical remission at week 8 were 16.5 on adalimumab and 9.3 on placebo, according to Sandborn et al., 2012. 

For
ustekinumab (Stelara ), in a study of moderate-to-severe UC, overall rates of clinical remission at week 8 were 15.6 on 130mg intravenous
ustekinumab and 5.3 on placebo, according to Sands et al., 2019. 

For
vedolizumab (Entyvio ), in a study of moderately to severely active UC, overall rates of clinical remission at week 6 were 17 on
vedolizumab and 5 on placebo, according to the FDA Entyvio Prescribing Label. 

UC
and CD are two of the most common forms of IBD. Both UC and CD are chronic, relapsing, remitting, inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal
tract that begin most commonly during adolescence and young adulthood. UC involves the innermost lining of the large intestine, and symptoms
include abdominal pain and diarrhea, frequently with blood and mucus. CD can affect the entire thickness of the bowel wall and all parts
of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. CD symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other more systemic symptoms such
as weight loss, nutritional deficiencies, and fever. 

The
current standard of care for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe IBD is typically anti-inflammatory agents. The majority
of IBD patients do not respond to first-line anti-tumor necrosis factor agents. The approvals of the first anti-tumor necrosis factor
agent for the treatment of CD in 1998 and newer biological agents, including anti-integrin and anti-IL12/23, have improved the care of
moderate-to-severe IBD. 

However,
these subsequently approved therapies in UC have generally failed to demonstrate a clinical remission effect size of more than 15 relative
to placebo. Moreover, among those patients who do respond to therapy, up to 50 will lose response over time. Additionally, the markets
for UC and CD represent a high unmet need patient population. Only 2 out of 5 UC patients are on advanced therapy.

IMX-120
Composition and Mechanism of Action 

Figure
28: IMX-120 Tissue-Specific Biologic TM with Immune Normalization Technology TM for Inflammatory Bowel Disease 

IMX-120,
built on our SMAR x T Tissue-Specific TM Platform with shared CMC and design elements with our other drug candidates,
is a Tissue-Specific Biologic TM with proprietary GLUT1/confidential target antibody encapsulating polyphenol poly-kinase inhibitors
selectively silencing disease-causing inflammatory bowel immune cells. 

Driving
inflammatory bowel disease are the interactions between 3 components of the immune synapse: 1) gut-lining enterocytes, 2) gut microbes,
and 3) gut-resident immune cells. Cellular contacts and signaling molecules exchanged between these components activate abnormal inflammatory
responses in immune cells driving a self-sustaining feed-forward loop of pathological inflammation in gastrointestinal tissues. Through
simultaneous repression of pathological inflammatory signaling in all of these components at the same time, Immune Normalization TM
 Technology halts this self-sustaining feed-forward loop propagated among these 3 components, addressing the root cause of inflammatory
pathologies. 

IBD
is caused by a dysregulated, chronic, pathological immune response by bowel immune cells to the microbiome and other components of the
gastrointestinal cellular environment. In the process of becoming dysregulated, cytotoxic T-cells and macrophages secrete signaling cytokines,
resulting in a self-sustaining feed-forward loop of inflammation. Similar to tumor growth, these inflammatory processes active in IBD
are caused by recurring waves of activation of multiple kinases that upregulate NF- B, STAT3 and other key transcriptional factors. 

IMX-120
takes advantage of the fact that overexpression and activation of GLUT1 on overactive immune cells has been shown to be widely present
in patients with IBD. IMX-120 s polyphenol poly-kinase inhibitors block upstream kinase signal transduction systems that activate
NF- B and STAT3, thus shutting down the self-sustaining feed-forward loop of inflammation. GLUT1 presents an ideal targeting moiety
for these overactive immune cells, allowing for tissue-specific delivery of IMX-120. 

Curcuminoid
polyphenols have been generally well-tolerated in multiple clinical trials, two of which are summarized below. 

In
a randomized, multi-center placebo-controlled, double-blind study of 50 mesalamine-treated patients with active mild-to-moderate ulcerative
colitis (UC) (defined by the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index, or SCCAI) who did not respond to an additional 2 weeks of the maximum
dose of mesalamine oral and topical therapy, patients were randomly assigned to groups who were given curcumin capsules (3 g/day, n =
26) or an identical placebo (n = 24) for 1 month, with continued mesalamine. The primary endpoint was the rate of clinical remission
(SCCAI 

32 

In
a randomized, double-blinded study performed at 5 independent medical centers in Japan, curcuminoid Theracurmin (360 mg/day, 20 patients)
or placebo (10 patients) was administered to patients with active mild-to-moderate Crohn s disease (CD) for 12 weeks. The agent s
clinical activity was assessed by evaluating clinical and endoscopic remission, healing of anal lesions, and blood levels of inflammatory
markers. The primary endpoint was the difference in Crohn s disease activity index, or CDAI, improvement between the Theracurmin
and placebo groups when comparing week 12 to week 0. No serious adverse events were observed in either group throughout the study. The
primary results of the trial at 4 weeks are outlined in the figure below (right hand side). 

For
both studies, because of the lack of previous data on the subject, a formal power analysis calculation of sample size was not performed.
Also for both studies, P

(Adapted
from Lang, et al., 2015 and Sugimoto et al., 2020. See above paragraphs for study descriptions) 

Despite
an almost complete lack of bioavailability in oral form, a polyphenol (curcumin) showed signs of clinical activity in a 50 patient UC
study, with >50 remission rate in the treatment arm at week 4 compared to a 0-13 remission rate in a control group at week 4. In
a 30 patient CD study, a polyphenol (theracurmin) produced a 35 clinical remission rate in the treatment arm at week 4 compared to 0 
in a control group at week 4. 

With
IMX-120 s proprietary GLUT1 targeting, we believe the potential for IMX-120 in IBD is favorable.

In
inflammatory bowel disease in mice, GLUT1 appears to be required for metabolic reprogramming of CD4 T cells into T effector cells that
are critical for induction of disease-causing inflammation (above figure left hand side graphical abstract). In mice, GLUT1 inhibition
results in the reduction of global tissue inflammatory score observed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining (above figure right hand

NEXCELLA
 CELL THERAPIES FOR HEMATOLOGIC MALIGNANCIES 

Overview
of Nexcella 

Nexcella,
Inc, our majority-owned subsidiary, is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of novel cell
therapies for oncology and other indications. We believe cell therapies are one of the forward pillars of medicine, and our mission is
to harness the power of cell therapies to rapidly engineer safe, effective, accessible treatments to improve patient outcomes in oncology
and other indications. Our N-GENIUS cell engineering platform with EXPAND technology has already produced clinical-stage NXC-201, which
we believe is the first outpatient autologous chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy CAR-T ). Autologous cells refer
to the patient s own cells (versus allogeneic, which refers to another person s cells). NXC-201 targets B-cell maturation
antigen BCMA for multiple myeloma MM and AL amyloidosis ALA ). Though CAR-T cell therapies
have shown benefits to date, they have historically faced barriers to adoption due to prolonged hospitalization with frequent intensive
care unit ICU stays due to unpredictable onset and duration of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome ICANS neurotoxicity and grade 3 and 4 cytokine release syndrome CRS ), leading to a 15-day median hospital
stay for CAR-T treatments today. NXC-201 has already demonstrated class-leading 90 overall response rates, 59 complete response rates,
and favorable tolerability in MM (exemplified by no ICANS neurotoxicity over 42 multiple myeloma patients). According to the National
Cancer Institute, overall response refers to the percentage of patients whose cancer shrinks or disappears after
treatment and complete response refers to the disappearance of all signs of cancer in response to treatment. 
Additionally, 8 ALA patients have also been treated by NXC-201 to-date with a 100 hematologic complete response rate, of which 5 published patients demonstrated 100 hematologic complete response
rate and 100 cardiac,
liver, and renal organ system response rate. Based on NXC-201 short (median onset day 1, median duration 2 day) low-grade CRS, we believe
NXC-201 could require only a 2-3 day hospital stay, potentially reducing hospital stay costs by 80-87 and make NXC-201 the first and
only potential outpatient CAR-T in development. Additionally, outpatient treatment could create a much larger accessible market/wider
access for NXC-201 (99 of CAR-T today is administered in large academic medical centers, which account for only 5 of medical centers
by count today in the US). 

35 

We
estimate the current market size for multiple myeloma therapies is 18 billion, expected to reach 29 billion in 2027, according to Wilcock,
et al. Nature Reviews . The Amyloidosis market was 3.6 billion in 2017, expected to reach 6 billion in 2025. 

We believe our N-GENIUS platform with EXPAND
technology will allow us to treat additional BCMA-positive indications such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL ), follicular
lymphoma FL ), Waldenstrom s macroglobulinemia, and B-cell lymphoma with NXC-201. We believe our platform will also
accelerate the development of CAR-T NXC-301 for acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL ), large B-Cell lymphoma LBCL and mantle cell lymphoma MCL ), as well as NXC-401 for Acute myeloid leukemia AML ). We plan to treat oncology
and other indications. 

Our
Lead Product Candidate (Nexcella) 

NXC-201,
currently in Phase 1b/2a clinical trials for relapsed or refractory r/r MM and relapsed or refractory (r/r) ALA, is a next generation
autologous CAR-T targeting BCMA. BCMA is a highly expressed protein in a number of hematologic malignancies including MM. When an antigen
such as BCMA is expressed on cancer cells, NXC-201 is able to target and kill those cancer cells, sparing healthy tissue. BCMA has been
shown to be over-expressed on MM, LBCL, CLL, ALA and other plasma cell dyscrasia diseased cells.

Multiple Myeloma Clinical Data To-Date 

Published
in Haematologica in 2022 and presented at the 5th European CAR T-cell Meeting, we recently announced positive interim results
for the 42 patients enrolled in our ongoing NEXTIVATE-1 (NCT04720313) Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of NXC-201, our lead product candidate,

Cleveland Clinic, for patients above 50 years of age, NT proBNP >900 (pg/mL) could mean heart function is unstable. Of the 4 patients

reduction) (units: pg/mL), respectively, after treatment with NXC-201. 

NXC-201:
Potentially The First Outpatient CAR-T 

We
believe NXC-201 is the first and only potential next-generation CAR-T treatment that could be delivered as an outpatient
treatment. 

Outpatient therapy may enable NXC-201
to address a much larger accessible market/wider access to NXC-201 CAR-T therapy (99 of CAR-T today is administered in large academic
medical centers, which account for only 5 of medical centers by count today in the US). Additionally, NXC-201 treatment may result in
an 80-87 reduction in hospital stay costs (2-3 day hospital stay NXC-201 vs. 15-day CAR-T standard). 

In
multiple myeloma, as of the October 23, 2022 data cutoff, low-grade CRS duration of median 2 days at therapeutic dose (range: 1-7 days)
(n=42) points to NXC-201 potentially becoming the first and only out-patient CAR-T for Multiple Myeloma and other BCMA-positive malignancies. 

In
AL amyloidosis, as of the October 23, 2022 publication date, no grade 4 CRS was observed, and CRS duration of median 4 days at therapeutic
dose (range: 1-5 days) (n=5) points to NXC-201 potentially becoming the first and only out-patient CAR-T for AL Amyloidosis.

Our
Market Opportunity (Nexcella) 

The
hematologic cancer market size is 60 billion today, growing to 120 billion in 2028. 

NXC-201
 Multiple Myeloma 

We
estimate the current market size for multiple myeloma therapies is 18 billion, expected to reach 29 billion in 2027, according to Wilcock,
et al. Nature Reviews . 

Multiple
myeloma MM is an incurable blood cancer of plasma cells that starts in the bone marrow and is characterized by an excessive
proliferation of these cells. Despite initial remission, unfortunately, most patients are likely to relapse. There are 34,470 patients
in the United States diagnosed with MM each year. Prognosis for patients who do not respond to or relapse after treatment with standard
therapies, including protease inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents remains poor. 

MM
is the third most common hematological malignancy in the United States and Europe, representing approximately 10 of all hematological
cancer cases, 20 of deaths due to hematological malignancies and impacting over 100,000 patients globally each year. The Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results SEER Program database projects that approximately 35,000 new cases of MM in the United States and over
35,000 new cases in six select markets within Europe and Asia. 

40 

In
2021, the FDA approved idecabtagene vicleucel (marketed as ABECMA by Bristol Myers Squibb), at the time the only BCMA-targeted CAR-T
for multiple myeloma. ABECMA was approved based on a 100-patient, open-label MM study which resulted in a complete response rate
of 28 and >= Grade 3 neurotoxicity of 8 at the therapeutic dose, according to the ABECMA FDA approval label.

a BCMA-targeted CAR-T for multiple myeloma. CART-ddBCMA was evaluated in a clinical trial in which 19 patients were treated at the therapeutic
dose, which resulted in a complete response rate of 71 , and >= Grade 3 neurotoxicity of 4 , according to Arcellx, Inc. 

NXC-201
 AL amyloidosis 

We
estimate the current market size for amyloidosis therapies is 3.6 billion, expected to reach 6 billion in 2027. 

ALA
is a rare systemic disorder caused by an abnormality of plasma cells in the bone marrow. Misfolded amyloid proteins produced by plasma
cells cause buildup in and around tissues, nerves and organs, gradually affecting their function. This can cause progressive and widespread
organ damage, and high mortality rates. 

ALA
affects roughly 30,000 40,000 patients in total throughout the U.S. and Europe, and it is estimated that there are approximately
3,000 4,000 new cases of AL amyloidosis annually in the U.S., though actual incidence is likely higher as a result of under-diagnosis.
Amyloidosis has a one-year mortality rate of 47 percent, 76 percent of which is caused by cardiac amyloidosis. 

ALA remains a high unmet need disease with just one FDA approved therapy
in the last two decades - daratumumab. 

In
2021, the FDA approved daratumumab (marketed as DARZALEX by Janssen/Johnson Johnson), which is the only FDA approved therapy
for AL amyloidosis. Daratumumab (DARZALEX was trialed in an ALA study where daratumumab was combined with cyclophosphamide + bortezomib
+ dexamethasone in a 4-drug combination, which produced a 53 hematologic complete response rate with a 42 organ response rate (cardiac)
according to Kastritis, et al., 2021. 

Why
Now? 

We are leveraging market CAR-T experience so far manufacturing consistency,
automation technology, efficacy, tolerability. 

Demand
 for MM CAR-Ts continues to exceed supply there are currently only 2 MM CAR-Ts on
 the market. 

Still
 common with approved CAR-Ts: High grade Cytokine Release Syndrome (> grade 3) and neurotoxicity
 side-effects. 

Bi-specifics/Allogeneic
 CAR-Ts still work in progress.

Our
Pipeline (Nexcella) 

We
are building a broad and scalable pipeline that has positioned us to capitalize on the potential of our proprietary platform technologies
and achieve long-term growth and sustainability within the field of cell therapy. We believe our N-GENIUS platform and EXPAND technology
will enable us to target a range of hematologic malignancies. 

We
have worldwide rights to all of our programs and have summarized our preclinical and clinical programs in the pipeline chart below: 

We
are in the process of extending our ongoing NEXICART-I (NCT04720313) Phase 1b/2a clinical trial to the United States, which could cause
NEXICART-I to be a registrational clinical trial, generating clinical data that could be included in a Biologics License Application
(BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Based on our current regulatory pathway, we believe that results from our NEXICART-I
trial, if positive, together with clinical results from our United States studies could be sufficient to support the filing of a BLA. 

Our
Platform and Technologies (Nexcella) 

Our
N-GENIUS platform has broad potential utility in hematologic and autoimmune disease. 

Our N-GENIUS platform, which has produced NXC-201, consists three key elements:
(1) Purpose-Built Cell Therapy Evidence Capture Engine + Relational Database, which relates Nexcella internal data to external to accelerate
therapy design, manufacture, and preclinical; (2) proprietary EXPAND technology, which is applied to multiple cell therapy indications,
already utilized to create NXC-201, to potentially increase efficacy and tolerability; and (3) Atomized, Novel Binding Scaffold Generation
Engine, which allows us to make the correct binding for every molecule. We believe key characteristics of NXC-201 may apply to other products
candidates produced by the N-GENIUS Platform. Those 3 key characteristics are: (a) high transduction efficiency (lower dose may lead to
lower toxicity), (b) low tonic signaling (lower off-target toxicity may lead to lower toxicity), and (c) anti-exhaustion capability (increased
persistence may lead to efficacy over an extended period of time). 

42 

Our
Clinical Development Plan and Milestones (Nexcella) 

We
are in the process of extending our ongoing NEXICART-I (NCT04720313) Phase 1b/2a clinical trial to the United States, which could cause
NEXICART-I to be a registrational clinical trial, generating clinical data that could be included in a Biologics License Application
(BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We also intend to rapidly pursue clinical development of NXC-201 in AL Amyloidosis,
in earlier lines of multiple myeloma therapy, and other BCMA-positive hematologic malignancies on an outpatient basis. 

In
MM, we plan to enroll approximately 100 patients in our ongoing open-label study at the recommended phase 2 dose, then submit a BLA for
approval to the FDA. 

In
ALA, we plan to enroll approximately 30-40 patients in an open-label study at the recommended phase 2 dose, then submit a BLA for approval
to the FDA. 

In
2023, we plan to continue to report interim data results from our ongoing phase 1b/2a NXC-201 clinical trial, complete a pre-IND meeting
with the FDA, file an IND for US phase 2 trial for NXC-201, and open a US clinical trial for NXC-201. 

We
plan to submit our first NXC-201 BLA to the FDA in the first half of 2025. 

43 

We
believe that the foundation of our competitive advantage is our proprietary technology, clinical evidence, track record of execution,
manufacturing success, and assembly of a proven management team. We believe these advantages may position us to achieve significant market
share in a large and attractive market and to ultimately transform the cell therapy market, contributing to a significant advancement
in medicine. 

Manufacturing 

We
have already established a track record of producing 7 batches of our TSTx according to current Good Manufacturing Practice cGMP ),
and have treated 17 patients so-far in our ongoing Phase 1b/2a clinical trial as of February 2023. 

We
will continue to leverage our established technical, manufacturing, analytical, quality, cGMP, project management expertise and existing
relationships to contract with appropriate CMOs to manufacture our TSTx TM moving forward. 

We
currently do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. To date, we have obtained active pharmaceutical ingredients API and drug product for our product candidates from several third party contract manufacturers. We are in the process of developing our
supply chain for each of our product candidates and have entered into agreements pursuant to which third-party contract manufacturers
will provide us with necessary quantities of API and drug product on a project-by-project basis based upon our needs. We rely, and expect
to continue to rely for the foreseeable future, on FDA, EMA, or other jurisdiction-registered third-party contract manufacturing organizations
to produce our product candidates for pre-clinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates
receive marketing approval. As part of the manufacture and design process for our product candidates, we rely on internal, scientific
and manufacturing know-how and trade secrets and the know-how and trade secrets of third-party manufacturers. We also contract with additional
third parties for the filling, labeling, packaging, storage and distribution of investigational drug products. We believe that this strategy
allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment
and personnel while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the development of our product candidates. We maintain agreements
with our manufacturers that include confidentiality and intellectual property, and quality provisions to protect our proprietary rights
related to our product candidates and satisfy regulatory requirements. 

Competition 

The
biotechnology industry is extremely competitive in the race to develop new products. While we believe we have significant competitive
advantages with our years of expertise in systems biology drug design, pharmacology and drug delivery, and clinical depth, trials and
expertise, and intellectual property position, we currently face and will continue to face competition for our development programs from
groups that are developing therapies for oncology and inflammation. The competition is likely to come from multiple sources, including
larger pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and academic institutions. 

Companies
developing therapies for both oncology and inflammation include, but are not limited to, Kymera Therapeutics Inc., Morphic Holding Inc.,
and RAPT Therapeutics Inc. Companies developing therapies for IBD (including UC and CD) include, but are not limited to, Arena Pharmaceuticals
Inc., Landos Biopharma Inc., and Seres Therapeutics Inc. 

Companies
developing CAR-Ts targeting multiple myeloma include, but are not limited to, Janssen/Johnson Johnson, Bristol Myers Squibb, and
Arcellx, Inc. Companies developing therapies for AL amyloidosis include, but are not limited to, Prothena Corp, Caelum Biosciences (Now
Alexion/AstraZeneca), and Janssen/Johnson Johnson. 

IMX-110
 Soft Tissue Sarcoma 

Drugs
in trials to treat STS include nivolumab (marketed as Opdivo , by Bristol Meyers Squibb), ipilimumab (marketed as Yervoy , by
Merck Co), and pembrolizumab (marketed as Keytruda , by Merck Co). 

44 

Nivolumab
(Opdivo ), was trialed in a study in which 61 of patients had received at least three previous lines of chemotherapy prior to nivolumab.
Nivolumab monotherapy produced a mPFS in sarcoma of 1.7 months, according to D Angelo et al., 2018. 

Nivolumab
(Opdivo and ipilimumab (Yervoy ), were trialed in a study in which 61 of patients had received at least three previous lines
of chemotherapy prior to a combination of nivolumab + ipilimumab. Nivolumab + ipilimumab combination therapy produced a mPFS in sarcoma
of 4.1 months, according to D Angelo et al., 2018. 

Pembrolizumab
(Keytruda , Merck Co), was trialed in a study in which 42 of patients had received at least three previous lines of chemotherapy
prior to pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab monotherapy produced a mPFS in sarcoma of 4.2 months, according to Tawbi et al., 2017. 

In
addition to the above, companies with approved therapies and that are developing therapies for soft tissue sarcoma include, but are
not limited to, BioAtla Inc., Epizyme Inc., Nanobiotix SA, C4 Therapeutics, Inc., Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc, Eisai, Novartis,
Mirati Therapeutics, Inc., and Janssen/Johnson Johnson. 

Intellectual
Property 

Our
success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how,
to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our strategy
is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States
and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, and product candidates
that are important to the development and implementation of our business. Our patent portfolio is intended to cover our product candidates
and related components, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, our proprietary reagents and assays, and any other

47 

Agreements
with Nexcella 

Founders
Agreement 

Effective
December 8, 2022, we entered a Founders Agreement with Nexcella (the Nexcella Founders Agreement ). Pursuant to the Nexcella
Founders Agreement, in consideration for the time and capital expended in the formation of Nexcella and the identification of specific
assets, the acquisition of which benefit Nexcella, we received 250,000 shares of Nexcella s Class A Preferred Stock, 1,000,000
shares of Nexcella s Class A Common Stock, and 5,000,000 shares of Nexcella s common stock. In addition, pursuant to the
Nexcella Founders Agreement, prior to a Qualified IPO (as defined in Nexcella s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation,
as amended (the Nexcella COI )) or Qualified Change in Control (as defined in the Nexcella COI), we shall provide funds
to Nexcella as requested by Nexcella, in good faith, to be evidenced by a senior unsecured promissory note. The Nexcella Founders Agreement
has a term of 15 years, which, upon expiration, automatically renews for successive one-year periods unless terminated by us upon notice
at least six months prior to the end of the term or upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the Nexcella Founders Agreement).
In exchange for the time and capital expended in the formation of Nexcella and the identification of specific assets, the acquisition
of which benefit Nexcella, on December 21, 2022, the Company loaned Nexcella approximately 2.1 million, evidenced by a senior unsecured
promissory note, which note matures on January 31, 2030, accrues interest at a rate of 7.875 per annum and is convertible into shares
of common stock of Nexcella at a conversion price of 2.00 per share, subject to adjustment; provided, however, that such note shall
automatically convert into shares of Nexcella common stock immediately prior to certain conversion triggers set forth in the note. Nexcella
may not prepay the note without our prior written consent . 

The
Class A Preferred Stock is identical to the common stock other than as to conversion rights, the PIK Dividend right (as defined below)
and voting rights. 

Each
share of Class A Preferred Stock is convertible, at our option, into one share of Nexcella s common stock, subject to certain adjustments.
As a holder of Nexcella s Class A Preferred Stock, we will receive on each March 13 (each a PIK Dividend Payment Date until the date all outstanding Class A Preferred Stock is converted into Nexcella s common stock or redeemed (and the purchase
price is paid in full), pro rata per share dividends paid in additional shares of Nexcella common stock PIK Dividends such that the aggregate number of shares of common stock issued pursuant to such PIK Dividend is equal to 2.5 of Nexcella s fully-diluted
outstanding capitalization on the date that is one business day prior to any PIK Dividend Payment Date. In addition, as a holder of Class
A Preferred Stock, we shall be entitled to cast for each share of Class A Preferred Stock held as of the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to vote on matters presented to the stockholders of Nexcella, the number of votes that is equal to 1.1 times a
fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of (A) the shares of outstanding Nexcella common stock and (B) the whole shares of Nexcella
common stock into which the shares of outstanding Nexcella Class A Common Stock and the Class A Preferred Stock are convertible and the
denominator of which is number of shares of outstanding Nexcella Class A Preferred Stock. 

Each
share of Class A Common Stock is convertible, at our option, into one share of Nexcella s common stock, subject to certain adjustments.
In addition, upon a Qualified IPO or Qualified Change in Control, the shares of Class A Common Stock, will automatically convert into
one share of Nexcella s common stock; provided however, if at that time, the Class A Common Stock is not then convertible into
a number of shares of Nexcella common stock (or such other capital stock or securities at the time issuable upon the conversion of the
Class A Common Stock) that have a value of: (a) in the case of a Qualified IPO, at least 5,000,000 based on the initial offering price
in such offering, or (b) in the case of a Qualified Change in Control, at least 5,000,000 in cash or at least 5,000,000 of equity based
on the implied value of a share of Nexcella common stock resulting from the price paid upon the consummation of such Qualified Change
of Control, the Class A Common Stock will automatically convert into such number of shares of Nexcella common stock (or such other capital
stock or securities at the time issuable upon the conversion of the Class A Common Stock) that have a value of 5,000,000 based on the
initial offering price in such offering or the implied value of a share of Nexcella common stock resulting from the price paid upon the
consummation of such Qualified Change of Control (or if such Qualified Change of Control results in the Class A Shares being exchanged
solely for cash, then 5,000,000 in cash). We shall be entitled to cast such number of votes equal to the number of whole shares
of Nexcella common stock into which our Class A Common Stock are convertible as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled
to vote on matters presented to the stockholders of Nexcella. 

In
addition to the foregoing, we shall be entitled to one vote for each share of Nexcella common stock held by us. Except as provided by
law or by the Nexcella COI, holders of Nexcella Class A Common Stock and Class A Preferred Stock shall vote together with the
holders of Nexcella common stock, as a single class. 

As
additional consideration under the Nexcella Founders Agreement, Nexcella will also: (i) pay an equity fee in shares of common stock,
payable within five business days of the closing of any equity or debt financing for Nexcella or any of its respective subsidiaries that
occurs after the effective date of the Nexcella Founders Agreement and ending on the date when we no longer have majority voting control
in Nexcella s voting equity, equal to 2.5 of the gross amount of any such equity or debt financing; and (ii) pay a cash fee equal
to 4.5 of Nexcella s annual Net Sales (as defined in the Nexcella Founders Agreement), payable on an annual basis. In the event
of a Change of Control, Nexcella will pay a one-time change in control fee equal to five times the product of (A) Net Sales for the 12
months immediately preceding the Change of Control and (B) 4.5 . 

Management
Services Agreement 

Effective
as of December 8, 2022, we entered into a Management Services Agreement (the Nexcella MSA with Nexcella. Pursuant to the
terms of the Nexcella MSA, we will render management, advisory and consulting services to Nexcella. Services provided under the Nexcella
MSA may include, without limitation, (i) advice and assistance concerning any and all aspects of Nexcella s operations, clinical
trials, financial planning and strategic transactions and financings and (ii) conducting relations on behalf of Nexcella with accountants,

Government
Regulations 

United
States Regulation of Drugs and Biologics 

We
expect that IMX-110 will be regulated by the FDA as a complex non-biologic by submitting a New Drug Application NDA ).
We expect that IMX-111 and IMX-120 will be regulated by the FDA as a biological product, or biologic, by submitting a Biologics License
Application BLA to the FDA. We expect to pursue United States and global regulatory designations, vouchers, conditional
approvals and accelerated approvals where appropriate. 

Our
business activities are subject to various laws, rules and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. 

The
FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among
other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging,
storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting
of drug products such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various pre-clinical,
clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies
or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. 

The
process required by the FDA before drug candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

completion
 of pre-clinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA s current Good Laboratory Practice
 GLP regulation; 

submission
 to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug IND ), which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must
 be updated annually or when significant changes are made; 

approval
 by an independent institutional review board IRB ), or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced; 

performance
 of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug candidate for its
 intended purpose; 

preparation
 of and submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; 

satisfactory
 completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; 

a
 determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to file the application for review; 

49 

satisfactory
 completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced
 to assess compliance with cGMP, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with current good clinical practice
 cGCP and 

FDA
 review and approval of the NDA or BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United
 States. 

Pre-clinical
and Clinical Development 

Prior
to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization
from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational
plan and the protocol(s) for clinical trials. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology,
pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing and controls information;
and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human
clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day
time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical
hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission
of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. 

Clinical
trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in
accordance with cGCP, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation
in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the
parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND
must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore,
an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and
its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities,
the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed
to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an
independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides
authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and
may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration
of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries. 

For
purposes of NDA or BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. 

Phase
 1 The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or
 condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational
 product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 

Phase
 2 The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to
 evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks.
 Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical
 trials. Some trials may combine aspects of Phase 1 and Phase 2 into a single clinical trial that can examine both safety in healthy
 volunteers and safety and preliminary efficacy in patients with a specific disease. 

Phase
 3 The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide
 statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed
 clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product
 and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. 

50 

A
registrational trial is a clinical trial that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate s
efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the drug. Generally, registrational trials are Phase 3 trials
but may be Phase 2 trials if the trial design provides a reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there
is an unmet medical need. 

In
some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain
more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the NDA or BLA. Concurrent
with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the characteristics of
the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements.
The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things,
must develop methods for testing the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies
must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

NDA
or BLA Submission and Review 

Assuming
successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development,
non-clinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product
for one or more indications. The NDA or BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent pre-clinical and clinical trials,
including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product s
chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. A determination by the FDA within 60 days of the receipt
of an NDA or BLA to file the application for review for its completeness is initiated at the time of submission. If the FDA determines
there is significance to the missing or incomplete information in the context of the proposed drug product, the proposed indication(s)
and the amount of time needed to address any given deficiency, it can issue a refusal-to-file letter. The submission of an NDA or BLA
requires payment of a substantial application user fee to FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. 

Once
an NDA has been submitted, the FDA s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application
for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both
standard and priority reviews, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective. The FDA may convene an advisory
committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect
the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing
processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within
required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure
compliance with cGCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable,
it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission
of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria
for approval. 

After
the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the product will be produced, the FDA may
issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific
prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified
in the NDA or BLA. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the
NDA or BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval
of an NDA or BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing
testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. 

51 

If
regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the
indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA or BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation
Strategy REMS ), to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known
or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their
safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution
methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to
proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval
if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace.
The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product s safety
and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing
studies. 

Expedited
Development and Review Programs 

Fast Track Designation 

The
FDA offers several expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. The fast track program is intended to
expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for
fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential
to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the
specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for frequent interactions with
the review team during product development and, once an NDA or BLA is submitted, the product may be eligible for priority review. A fast
track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA or BLA on a rolling
basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA
or BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA or BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any
required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA. 

Breakthrough Therapy Designation 

A
product intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation
to expedite its development and review. A product can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates
that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such
as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features,
as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the
development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers. 

Priority Review 

Any
product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention
of a serious disease or condition compared to marketed products. For products containing new molecular entities, priority review designation
means the FDA s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with
ten months under standard review). 

Additionally,
products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated
approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit,
or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict
an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of
the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally
require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the anticipated effect
on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for accelerated
approval, pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 

Regenerative
Medicine Advanced Therapy Designation 

With
passage of the Cures Act in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as
regenerative medicine advanced therapies. A product is eligible for RMAT designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that
is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence
indicates that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Regenerative medicine
therapies include cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue products and combination products that
use such products. The benefits of a regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation include early interactions with FDA to
expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review, and
accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints. RMAT designation may be rescinded if a product no longer meets
the qualifying criteria. 

Rare
Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program 

With
enactment of the FDASIA in 2012, Congress authorized the FDA to award priority review vouchers to sponsors of certain rare pediatric
disease product applications that meet the criteria specified in the law. This provision is designed to encourage development of new
drug and biological products for prevention and treatment of certain rare pediatric diseases. Specifically, under this program, a sponsor
who receives an approval for a drug or biologic for a rare pediatric disease may qualify for a voucher that can be redeemed
to receive a priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. The sponsor of a rare pediatric disease drug
product receiving a priority review voucher may transfer (including by sale) the voucher to another sponsor. The voucher may be further
transferred any number of times before the voucher is used, as long as the sponsor making the transfer has not yet submitted the application. 

For
the purposes of this program, a rare pediatric disease is a (a) serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious
or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years, including age groups often called neonates,
infants, children, and adolescents; and (b) rare disease or conditions within the meaning of the Orphan Drug Act. A sponsor may
choose to request RPDD, but the designation process is entirely voluntary; requesting designation is not a prerequisite to requesting
or receiving a priority review voucher. In addition, sponsors who choose not to submit a RPDD request may nonetheless receive a
priority review voucher if they request such a voucher in their original marketing application and meet all of the eligibility criteria.
The Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program was extended as part of the 2021 Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental
Consolidated Appropriations Act in December 2020. As part of this extension, after September 30, 2024, the FDA may only award a voucher
for an approved rare pediatric disease product application if the sponsor has a RPDD for the drug that was granted by September 30, 2024.
After September 30, 2026, the FDA may not award any additional rare pediatric disease priority review vouchers. 

52 

Orphan
Drug Designation 

Under
the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which
is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United
States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic
for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation
must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic
agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or
shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. 

If
a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation,
the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications,
including a full NDA or BLA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as
a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from
approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition.
Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the application user fee. 

A
designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which
it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines
that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product
to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 

Post-Approval
Requirements 

Any
products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including,
among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and
distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new
indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements,
under which FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved NDA or BLA. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors
are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections
by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us
and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of
the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any
deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly,
manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with
cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 

The
FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product
reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity
or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved
labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition
of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under an REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 

restrictions
 on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 

fines,
 warning or untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 

refusal
 of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product
 approvals; 

product
 seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; or 

injunctions
 or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

53 

The
FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics and drugs. A company can make only those claims
relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved
label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product s FDA approved
labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to
comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning or untitled letters, corrective advertising
and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the
product s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical
specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does
not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer s communications
on the subject of off-label use of their products. 

Europe 

European
Drug Development 

In
the European Union, our future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal
products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. 

Similar
to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory
controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting
out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the European Union, the EU Member States have transposed and
applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the Member State regimes. Under the current
regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by
two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority NCA ), and one or more Ethics Committees ECs ). Under
the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have
to be reported to the NCA and Ecs of the Member State where they occurred. 

The
EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial
authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency.
In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials
Directive 2001/20/EC. It is expected that the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 will apply following confirmation of full
functionality of the Clinical Trials Information System, the centralized EU portal and database for clinical trials foreseen by the Regulation,
through an independent audit, currently expected to occur in January 2022. The new Regulation will be directly applicable in all Member
States (and so does not require national implementing legislation in each Member State), and aims at simplifying and streamlining the
approval of clinical studies in the EU, for instance by providing for a streamlined application procedure via a single point and strictly
defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical study applications. 

54 

European
Drug Review and Approval 

In
the European Economic Area EEA ), which is comprised of the Member States of the European Union together with Norway, Iceland
and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization MA ). There
are two main types of Mas: 

The
 centralized MA is issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for
 Medicinal Products for Human Use CHMP ), of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The centralized
 procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy
 medicinal products (i.e. gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and medicinal products containing a new
 active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune
 dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized
 in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest
 of public health in the European Union. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MA application
 by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in
 response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of a MA application considerably beyond
 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, the EMA provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European
 Commission, who make the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA s
 recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to
 be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation
 of a MA application under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding stop-clocks, but it is possible that the
 CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate
 to conduct an accelerated assessment. 

National
 Mas, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are
 available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized
 for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this national MA can be recognized in other Member States through the mutual recognition
 procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously
 in various Member States through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted
 to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as
 the Reference Member State RMS ). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary
 of the product characteristics, or SmPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States
 (referred to as the Concerned Member States) for their approval. If the Concerned Member States raise no objections, based on a potential
 serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted
 a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Concerned Member States). 

Under
the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an
assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 

European
New Chemical Entity Exclusivity 

In
the EEA, medicinal products for human use qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional
two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator s
preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing
authorization, for a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EEA. During the additional
two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator s data
may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity period. The overall
ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization
holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization,
are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. Even if an innovative medicinal
product gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained
a marketing authorization based on an application with a complete and independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests
and clinical trials. 

55 

European
orphan designation and exclusivity 

In
the EEA, the EMA s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products
that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions which either
affect no more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, or where it is unlikely that the marketing of the medicine would generate
sufficient return to justify the necessary investment in its development. In each case, no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention
or treatment has been authorized (or, if such a method exists, the product in question would be of significant benefit to those affected
by the condition). 

In
the EEA, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers, and ten years of
market exclusivity is granted following marketing approval for the orphan product. This period may be reduced to six years if, at the
end of the fifth year, it is established that the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that
the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. During the period of market exclusivity, marketing
authorization may only be granted to a similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication if: (i) a second applicant
can establish that its product, although similar to the authorized product, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
(ii) the marketing authorization holder for the authorized product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii)
the marketing authorization holder for the authorized product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. A similar medicinal
product is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan
medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting
an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory
review and approval process. 

European
pediatric investigation plan 

In
the EEA, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree upon a pediatric investigation plan PIP ), with the EMA s
Pediatric Committee PDCO ), and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless a waiver applies.
The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing
authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until
there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric
clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when this data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective
or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product
does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Products that are granted a marketing
authorization with the results of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP (even where such results are negative)
are eligible for six months supplementary protection certificate extension (if any is in effect at the time of approval). In the
case of orphan medicinal products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject
to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted. 

PRIME
Designation 

In
March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few
or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority Medicines PRIME scheme is a voluntary scheme intended to encourage drug
development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation, where
the marketing authorization application will be made through the centralized procedure. Eligible products must target conditions for
which where is an unmet medical need (there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment in the EEA or, if there is,
the new medicine will bring a major therapeutic advantage) and they must demonstrate the potential to address the unmet medical need
by introducing new methods of therapy or improving existing ones. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier
entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including
but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development
program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated
contact and rapporteur from the EMA s CHMP or Committee for Advanced Therapies are appointed early in PRIME scheme facilitating
increased understanding of the product at EMA s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes
a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies. Where, during
the course of development, a medicine no longer meets the eligibility criteria, support under the PRIME scheme may be withdrawn. 

56 

Australia 

Our
clinical trial for IMX-110 is being conducted in Australia and the United States. The Therapeutic Goods Administration TGA and the National Health and Medical Research Council set the GCP requirements for clinical research in Australia, and compliance with
these codes is mandatory. Australia has also adopted international codes, such as those promulgated by the International Council for
Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use ICH ). The ICH guidelines must
be complied with across all fields of clinical research, including those related to pharmaceutical quality, nonclinical and clinical
data requirements and trial designs. The basic requirements for preclinical data to support a first-in-human trial under ICH guidelines
are applicable in Australia. Requirements related to adverse event reporting in Australia are similar to those required in other major
jurisdictions. 

Clinical
trials conducted using unapproved therapeutic goods in Australia, being those which have not yet been evaluated by the
TGA for quality, safety and efficacy must occur pursuant to either the Clinical Trial Notification Scheme CTN Scheme or the Clinical Trial Exemption Scheme CTX Scheme ). In each case, the trial is supervised by a Human Research Ethics Committee HREC ), an independent review committee set up under guidelines of the Australian National Health and Medical Research
Council that ensures the protection of rights, safety and well-being of human subjects involved in a clinical trial. A HREC does this
by reviewing, approving and providing continuing examination of trial protocols and amendments, and of the methods and material to be
used in obtaining and documenting informed consent of the trial subjects. 

The
CTN Scheme broadly involves: 

completion
 of preclinical laboratory and animal testing; 

submission
 to a HREC, of all material relating to the proposed clinical trial, including the trial protocol; 

the
 institution or organization at which the trial will be conducted, referred to as the Approving Authority , giving final
 approval for the conduct of the trial at the site, having regard to the advice from the HREC; and 

the
 investigator submitting a Notification of Intent to Conduct a Clinical Trial form, or CTN Form, to the TGA. The CTN
 form must be signed by the sponsor, the principal investigator, the chairman of the HREC and a person responsible from the Approving
 Authority. The TGA does not review any data relating to the clinical trial however CTN trials cannot commence until the trial has
 been notified to the TGA. 

Under
the CTX Scheme: 

a
 sponsor submits an application to conduct a clinical trial to the TGA for evaluation and comment; and 

a
 sponsor must forward any comments made by the TGA Delegate to the HREC(s) at the sites where the trial will be conducted. 

A
sponsor cannot commence a trial under the CTX Scheme until written advice has been received from the TGA regarding the application and
approval for the conduct of the trial has been obtained from an ethics committee and the institution at which the trial will be conducted. 

57 

Approval
for inclusion in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods ARTG is required before a pharmaceutical product may be
marketed (or imported, exported or manufactured) in Australia. In order to obtain registration of the product on the ARTG, it is required
that: 

adequate
 and well-controlled clinical trials demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the therapeutic product; 

evidence
 is compiled which demonstrates that the manufacture of the therapeutic product complies with the principles of cGMP; 

manufacturing
 and clinical data is derived to submit to the Advisory Committee on Prescription Medicines, which makes recommendations to the TGA
 as to whether or not to grant approval to include the therapeutic product in the ARTG; and 

an
 ultimate decision is made by the TGA whether to include the therapeutic product in the ARTG. 

Regulation
and Procedures Governing Approval of Products in Other Jurisdictions 

The
requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, drug licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all
cases, clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. If we fail to comply with applicable
foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product
recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 

Coverage
and Reimbursement 

Sales
of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our drugs will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health
programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements
for medical drugs and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments,
and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown
significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements
for substitution of generic drugs. 

There
may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the
purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States. Moreover, eligibility
for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including
research, development, intellectual property protection, manufacture, sale and distribution expenses. Interim reimbursement levels for
new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according
to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower-cost
drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or
rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports
of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare
coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval process
apart from Medicare determinations. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for our product candidates, once
approved, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 

In
addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements
governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. 

58 

Healthcare
Laws and Regulations 

Sales
of our product candidates, if approved, will be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states
and foreign governments in which we might conduct our business. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate
include the following: 

The
 federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a criminal statute, makes it illegal for any person or entity to knowingly and willfully, directly
 or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including
 the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program,
 such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The
 Civil Monetary Penalties Law also contains a provision that prohibits the payment of anything of value in return for referrals and
 provides for the imposition of civil penalties. 

the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 1395nn)
(the Stark Law prohibit referrals by a physician of designated health services which are payable, in whole
or in part, by Medicare or Medicaid, to an entity in which the physician or the physician s immediate family member has an investment
interest or other financial relationship, subject to several exceptions. The Stark Law also prohibits billing for services rendered pursuant
to a prohibited referral. Several states have enacted laws similar to the Stark Law. These state laws may cover all (not just Medicare
and Medicaid) patients. We consider the Stark Law in planning our products, marketing and other activities, and believe that our operations
are in compliance with the Stark Law. If we violate the Stark Law, our financial results and operations could be adversely affected. Penalties
for violations include denial of payment for the services, significant civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid
programs. 

Federal
 false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibits, among other things, any person or
 entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare
 and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent. 

Health
 Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Health Information and Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act
 and their implementing regulations at 45 C.F.R. Parts 160, 162 and 164, as amended HIPAA created additional federal
 criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud
 any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors or making any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection
 with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 

HIPAA,
 as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 and their implementing regulations,
 imposes obligations on certain types of individuals and entities regarding the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare
 transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. 

The
 federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which
 payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report
 annually to the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services information related to payments or other transfers of value made to
 physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 

Also,
many states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and may apply
regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, we may be subject
to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the federal government s and/or pharmaceutical industry s
voluntary compliance guidelines, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers
of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, as well as state and foreign laws governing the privacy
and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA. These
laws are subject to extensive and increasing enforcement by numerous federal, state, and local government agencies including the Office
of Inspector General, the Department of Justice, the CMS, the Office of Civil Rights, and various state authorities. 

Additionally,
to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws. 

Employees 

As
of March 17, 2023, we had 11 employees, 9 of which are full-time employees. Of such employees, 7 are engaged in research and development.
None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, nor have we experienced work
stoppages. We believe that relations with our employees are good. 

Our
Corporate History 

We
were incorporated as a California limited liability company in 2012 and converted to a Delaware corporation in January 2014. In August
2016, we established a wholly-owned Australian subsidiary, Immix Biopharma Australia Pty Ltd., in order to conduct various pre-clinical
and clinical activities for the development of our product candidates. In November 2022, we established a Delaware corporation, Nexcella,
Inc., in order to conduct various pre-clinical and clinical activities for the development of our product candidates. ImmixBio currently
owns 98 of Nexcella.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS. 

An
investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and the other
information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before investing in our common stock. Our business and results of operations could be
seriously harmed by any of the following risks. The risks set out below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties
not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition
and/or operating results. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be
materially adversely affected. In such case, the value and trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part
of your investment. 

Risks
Relating to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs 

We
have incurred substantial losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial and increasing losses
for the foreseeable future. 

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing
a novel class of TSTx in oncology and inflammation. Investment in biopharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because
it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that a product candidate will fail to prove effective, gain regulatory
approval or become commercially viable. We do not have any products approved by regulatory authorities and have not generated any revenues
from collaboration or licensing agreements or product sales to date, and have incurred significant research, development and other expenses
related to our ongoing operations and expect to continue to incur such expenses. As a result, we have not been profitable and have incurred
significant operating losses since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we reported net losses of 8,229,713
and 24,383,879, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of 37,985,247. 

We
do not expect to generate revenues for many years, if at all. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses
for the foreseeable future. We anticipate these losses to increase as we continue to research, develop and seek regulatory approvals
for our current product candidates and any additional product candidates we may acquire, and potentially begin to commercialize product
candidates that may achieve regulatory approval. We may also encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other
unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future
growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenues. Our expenses will further increase as we: 

conduct
 pre-clinical and clinical trials of our product candidates; 

in-license
 or acquire the rights to, and pursue development of, other products, product candidates or technologies; 

hire
 additional clinical, manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and scientific personnel; 

seek
 marketing approval for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; 

60 

establish
 sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, if we receive, or expect to receive, marketing approval for any product candidates; 

maintain,
 expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and 

add
 operational, financial and management information systems and personnel. 

We
need significant additional financing to fund our operations and complete the development and, if approved, the commercialization of
our product candidates. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development
programs or commercialization efforts. 

We
will need to raise significant additional capital to complete development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.
Although we believe that our existing cash balance of 13,436,714 as of December 31, 2022, and funds available to be raised pursuant to the Sales Agreement, will be sufficient to meet our cash, operational and liquidity requirements for at
least 12 months from March 27, 2023, our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may
need additional funds sooner than planned. 

We
expect to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future to continue the clinical development and manufacturing of our product
candidates. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development, potentially acquiring new product candidates
or technologies, conducting pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and potentially obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing
products, as well as marketing and selling products approved for sale, if any. 

Additional
funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We have no committed source of additional
capital. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may not be able to continue as a going concern or we may be
required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate pre-clinical studies, clinical trials or other development activities for our product candidates
or target indications, or delay, limit, reduce or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities
that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates. 

Raising
additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our
product candidates on unfavorable terms to us. 

We
may seek additional capital through a variety of means, including through private and public equity offerings and debt financings, collaborations,
strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the
sale of equity or convertible debt securities, or through the issuance of shares under management or other types of contracts, or upon
the exercise or conversion of outstanding derivative securities, the ownership interests of our stockholders will be diluted, and the
terms of such financings may include liquidation or other preferences, anti-dilution rights, conversion and exercise price adjustments
and other provisions that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders, including rights, preferences and privileges that are senior
to those of our holders of common stock in the event of a liquidation. In addition, debt financing, if available, could include covenants
limiting or restricting our ability to take certain actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, entering
into licensing arrangements, or declaring dividends and may require us to grant security interests in our assets, including our intellectual
property. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements
with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, products or product candidates
or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings
when needed, we may need to curtail or cease our operations. 

61 

We
currently have no source of revenues. We may never generate revenues or achieve profitability. 

Currently,
we do not generate any revenues from product sales or otherwise. Even if we are able to successfully achieve regulatory approval for
our product candidates, we do not know when we will generate revenues or become profitable, if at all. Our ability to generate revenues
from product sales and achieve profitability will depend on our ability to successfully commercialize products, including our current
product candidates and other product candidates that we may develop, in-license or acquire in the future. Our ability to generate revenues
and achieve profitability also depends on a number of additional factors, including our ability to: 

successfully
 complete development activities, including the necessary clinical trials; 

complete
 and submit either BLAs or NDAs to the FDA and obtain U.S. regulatory approval for indications for which there is a commercial market; 

complete
 and submit applications to foreign regulatory authorities; 

obtain
 regulatory approval in territories with viable market sizes; 

obtain
 coverage and adequate reimbursement from third parties, including government and private payors; 

set
 commercially viable prices for our products, if any; 

establish
 and maintain supply and manufacturing relationships with reliable third parties, legally globally compliant manufacturing of bulk
 drug substances and drug products to maintain that supply; 

develop
 distribution processes for our product candidates; 

develop
 commercial quantities of our product candidates, if approved, at acceptable cost levels; 

obtain
 additional funding if required to develop and commercialize our product candidates; 

develop
 sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for products we intend to sell; 

achieve
 market acceptance of our products; 

attract,
 hire and retain qualified personnel; and 

protect
 our intellectual property rights. 

Our
revenues for any product candidates for which regulatory approval is obtained will be dependent, in part, upon the size of the markets
in the territories for which it gains regulatory approval, the accepted price for the products, the ability to get reimbursement at any
price, and whether we own the commercial rights for that territory. If the number of our addressable disease patients is not as significant
as our estimates, the indication approved by regulatory authorities is narrower than we expect, or the reasonably accepted population
for treatment is narrowed by competition, physician choice or treatment guidelines, we may not generate significant revenues from sales
of such products, even if approved. In addition, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved
product candidates. As a result, even if we generate revenues, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding
to continue operations. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be
unable to continue our operations at planned levels and may be forced to reduce our operations. 

Our
ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to limitations. 

As of December 31, 2022, we had federal net operating loss NOLs carryforwards of approximately 5,800,000. Our NOLs generated in tax years ending on or prior to December 31, 2017 are only permitted
to be carried forward for 20 years under applicable U.S. tax laws, and will begin to expire, if not utilized, beginning in 2027. These
NOL carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Under the Tax Act, federal NOLs incurred
in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal NOLs is limited.
It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act, or whether any further regulatory changes may be adopted
in the future that could minimize its applicability. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
and certain corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, which is generally defined
as a greater than 50 change, by value, in the ownership of its equity over a three-year period, the corporation s ability to use
its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. 

62 

Risks
Relating to the Development and Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates 

We
have a limited number of product candidates, all which are still in early clinical or pre-clinical development. If we do not obtain regulatory
approval of one or more of our product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially adversely
affected. 

We
currently have no products approved for sale or marketing in any country, and may never be able to obtain regulatory approval for any
of our product candidates. As a result, we are not currently permitted to market any of our product candidates in the United States or
in any other country until we obtain regulatory approval from the FDA or regulatory authorities outside the United States. Our product
candidates are in early stages of development and we have not submitted an application, or received marketing approval, for any of our
product candidates. Obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to,
the following: 

successfully
 completing formulation and process development activities; 

completing
 clinical trials that demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidates; 

receiving
 marketing approval from applicable regulatory authorities; 

establishing
 commercial manufacturing capabilities; and 

launching
 commercial sales, marketing and distribution operations. 

Many
of these factors are wholly or partially beyond our control, including clinical advancement, the regulatory submission process and changes
in the competitive landscape. If we do not achieve one or more of these targets in a timely manner, we could experience significant delays
or may be unable to develop our product candidates at all, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

Clinical
trials are expensive, time consuming, difficult to design and implement, and involve uncertain outcomes. Results of previous pre-clinical
studies and clinical trials may not be predictive of future results, and the results of our current and planned clinical trials may not
satisfy the requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities. 

Positive
or timely results from pre-clinical or early-stage trials do not ensure positive or timely results in late-stage clinical trials or product
approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. We will be required to demonstrate with substantial evidence through
well-controlled clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in a diverse population before we can seek
regulatory approvals for their commercialization. Our planned clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we or
any of our current and future strategic partners may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical or pre-clinical
testing. 

Success
in pre-clinical studies or early-stage clinical trials does not mean that future clinical trials or registration clinical trials will
be successful because product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to the
satisfaction of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, despite having progressed through pre-clinical studies and initial clinical
trials. Product candidates that have shown promising results in early clinical trials may still suffer significant setbacks in subsequent
clinical trials or registration clinical trials. For example, a number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry, including those
with greater resources and experience than us, have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after obtaining promising
results in earlier clinical trials. Similarly, pre-clinical interim results of a clinical trial are not necessarily predictive of final
results. 

63 

If
clinical trials for our product candidates are prolonged, delayed or stopped, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize
our product candidates on a timely basis, or at all, which would require us to incur additional costs and delay our receipt of any product
revenue. 

We
may experience delays in our ongoing or future pre-clinical studies or clinical trials, and we do not know whether future pre-clinical
studies or clinical trials will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll an adequate number of patients or be completed on schedule,
if at all. The commencement or completion of these planned clinical trials could be substantially delayed or prevented by many factors,
including, but not limited to: 

discussions
 with the FDA or other regulatory agencies regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials; 

the
 limited number of, and competition for, suitable sites to conduct our clinical trials, many of which may already be engaged in other
 clinical trial programs, including some that may be for the same indication as our product candidates; 

any
 delay or failure to obtain approval or agreement to commence a clinical trial in any of the countries where enrollment is planned; 

inability
 to obtain sufficient funds required for a clinical trial; 

clinical
 holds on, or other regulatory objections to, a new or ongoing clinical trial; 

delay
 or failure to manufacture sufficient supplies of product candidates for our clinical trials; 

delay
 or failure to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial agreement terms or clinical trial protocols with prospective sites or
 clinical research organizations CROs ), the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly
 among different sites or CROs; 

delay
 or failure to obtain IRB approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site; 

slower
 than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment; 

failure
 of patients to complete the clinical trial; 

the
 inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients in studies to ensure adequate statistical power to detect statistically significant
 treatment effects; 

unforeseen
 safety issues, including severe or unexpected drug-related adverse effects experienced by patients, including possible deaths; 

lack
 of efficacy during clinical trials; 

termination
 of our clinical trials by one or more clinical trial sites; 

inability
 or unwillingness of patients or clinical investigators to follow our clinical trial protocols; 

inability
 to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment; 

clinical
 study sites failing to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at
 all, deviating from the protocol or dropping out of a study; 

inability
 to address any non-compliance with regulatory requirements or safety concerns that arise during the course of a clinical trial; 

the
 need to repeat or terminate clinical trials as a result of inconclusive or negative results or unforeseen complications in testing;
 and 

our
 clinical trials may be suspended or terminated upon a breach or pursuant to the terms of any agreement with, or for any other reason
 by, current or future strategic partners that have responsibility for the clinical development of any of our product candidates. 

64 

Changes
in regulatory requirements, policies and guidelines may also occur and we may need to significantly amend clinical trial protocols to
reflect these changes with appropriate regulatory authorities. These changes may require us to renegotiate terms with CROs or resubmit
clinical trial protocols to IRBs for re-examination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial.
Our clinical trials may be suspended or terminated at any time by the FDA, other regulatory authorities, the IRB overseeing the clinical
trial at issue, any of our clinical trial sites with respect to that site, or us. Any failure or significant delay in commencing or completing
clinical trials for our product candidates may adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval and our commercial prospects
and our ability to generate product revenue will be diminished. 

The
design or our execution of clinical trials may not support regulatory approval. 

The
design or execution of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support regulatory approval and flaws in the design or
execution of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. In some instances, there can be significant
variability in safety or efficacy results between different trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes
in trial protocols, differences in size and type of the patient populations, adherence to the dosing regimen and other trial protocols
and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. We do not know whether any clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate
consistent or adequate efficacy and safety to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates. 

Further,
the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and in determining when or
whether regulatory approval will be obtained for any of our product candidates. Our product candidates may not be approved even if they
achieve their primary endpoints in future clinical trials. The FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our trial design
and our interpretation of data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. In addition, any of these regulatory authorities may change
requirements for the approval of a product candidate even after reviewing and providing comments or advice on a protocol for clinical
trial that has the potential to result in FDA or other agencies approval. In addition, such regulatory authorities may also approve
a product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than we request or may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly
post-marketing clinical trials. The FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may not approve the labeling claims that we believe would be
necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates which may have a material adverse effect on our
business. 

We
may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials given the limited number of patients who have the diseases for which
our product candidates are being studied which could delay or prevent the start of clinical trials for our product candidates. 

Identifying
and qualifying patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidate is essential to our success. The timing of our clinical
trials depends in part on the rate at which we can recruit patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates, and
we may experience delays in our clinical trials if we encounter difficulties in enrollment. If we experience delays in our clinical trials,
the timeline for obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates will most likely be delayed. 

Many
factors may affect our ability to identify, enroll and maintain qualified patients, including the following: 

eligibility
 criteria of our ongoing and planned clinical trials with specific characteristics appropriate for inclusion in our clinical trials; 

design
 of the clinical trial; 

size
 and nature of the patient population; 

patients 
 perceptions as to risks and benefits of the product candidate under study and the participation in a clinical trial generally in
 relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating; 

65 

the
 availability and efficacy of competing therapies and clinical trials; 

pendency
 of other trials underway in the same patient population; 

willingness
 of physicians to participate in our planned clinical trials; 

severity
 of the disease under investigation; 

proximity
 of patients to clinical sites; 

patients
 who do not complete the trials for personal reasons; and 

issues
 with CROs and/or with other vendors that handle our clinical trials. 

We
may not be able to initiate or continue to support clinical trials of our product candidates for one or more indications, or any future
product candidates, if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible participants in these trials as required by
the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Even if we are able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials, if the
pace of enrollment is slower than we expect, the development costs for our product candidates may increase and the completion of our
trials may be delayed or our trials could become too expensive to complete. 

If
we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trials of our product candidates, the commercial prospects
of our product candidates could be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenue from any of our product candidates could be delayed
or prevented. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials would likely increase our overall costs, impair product candidate
development and jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval relative to our current plans. Any of these occurrences may harm
our business, financial condition, and prospects significantly. 

Our
product candidates may have undesirable side effects that may delay or prevent marketing approval or, if approval is received, require
them to be taken off the market, require them to include safety warnings or otherwise limit their sales; no regulatory agency has made
any such determination that any of our product candidates are safe or effective for use by the general public for any indication. 

All
of our product candidates are still in pre-clinical or early clinical development. Additionally, all of our product candidates are required
to undergo ongoing safety testing in humans as part of clinical trials. Consequently, not all adverse effects of drugs can be predicted
or anticipated. Unforeseen side effects from any of our product candidates could arise either during clinical development or, if approved
by regulatory authorities, after the approved product has been marketed. Therefore, the results from clinical trials may not demonstrate
a favorable safety profile in humans. The results of future clinical trials may show that our product candidates cause undesirable or
unacceptable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, and result in delay of, or failure to obtain, marketing
approval from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, or result in marketing approval from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities
with restrictive label warnings, limited patient populations or potential product liability claims. Even if we believe that our clinical
trial and pre-clinical studies demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, only the FDA and other comparable regulatory
agencies may ultimately make such determination. No regulatory agency has made a determination that any of our product candidates are
safe or effective for any indication. 

If
any of our product candidates receive marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable or unacceptable side effects caused
by such products: 

regulatory
 authorities may require us to take our approved product off the market; 

regulatory
 authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, specific warnings, and/or a contraindication or field alerts to physicians
 and pharmacies; 

66 

we
 may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product; 

we
 may be subject to limitations on how we may promote the product; 

sales
 of the product may decrease significantly; 

we
 may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and 

our
 reputation may suffer. 

Any
of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase
commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating revenue from the sale of any future products. 

We
are dependent on third parties for manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates. If we are not able to secure favorable arrangements
with such third parties, our business and financial condition could be harmed. 

We
will not manufacture any of our product candidates for commercial sale nor do we have the resources necessary to do so. In addition,
we currently do not have the capability to market our drug products ourselves. In addition to our internal sales force efforts, we have
contracted with and intend to continue to contract with specialized manufacturing companies to manufacture our product candidates. In
connection with our efforts to commercialize our product candidates, we will seek to secure favorable arrangements with third parties
to distribute, promote, market and sell our product candidates. If our internal sales force is unable to successfully distribute, market
and promote our product candidates and we are not able to secure favorable commercial terms or arrangements with third parties for the
distribution, marketing, promotion and sales of our product candidates, we may have to retain promotional and marketing rights and seek
to develop the commercial resources necessary to promote or co-promote or co-market certain or all of our drug candidates to the appropriate
channels of distribution in order to reach the specific medical market that we are targeting. We may not be able to enter into any partnering
arrangements on this or any other basis. If we are not able to secure favorable partnering arrangements, or are unable to develop the
appropriate resources necessary for the commercialization of our product candidates, our business and financial condition could be harmed. 

In
addition, we, or our potential commercial partners, may not successfully introduce our product candidates or such candidates may not
achieve acceptance by patients, health care providers and insurance companies. Further, it is possible that we may not be able to secure
arrangements to manufacture, market, distribute, promote and sell our proposed product candidates at favorable commercial terms that
would permit us to make a profit. To the extent that corporate partners conduct clinical trials, we may not be able to control the design
and conduct of these clinical trials. 

If
a third-party contract manufacturing organization CMO upon whom we rely to formulate and manufacture our product candidates
does not perform, fails to manufacture according to our specifications or fails to comply with strict regulations, our pre-clinical studies
or clinical trials could be adversely affected and the development of our product candidates could be delayed or terminated or we could
incur significant additional expenses. 

We
do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We rely on and intend to continue to rely on CMOs to formulate and manufacture our
pre-clinical and clinical materials. Our reliance on a CMO exposes us to a number of risks, any of which could delay or prevent the completion
of our pre-clinical studies or clinical trials, or the regulatory approval or commercialization of our product candidates, result in
higher costs, or deprive us of potential product revenues. Some of these risks include: 

our
 CMO failing to develop an acceptable formulation to support later-stage clinical trials for, or the commercialization of, our product
 candidates; 

67 

our
 CMO failing to manufacture our product candidate according to our specifications, the FDA s cGMP requirements, or otherwise
 manufacturing material that we, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may deem to be unsuitable in our clinical trials; 

our
 CMO being unable to increase the scale of, increase the capacity for, or reformulate the form of our product candidates. We may experience
 a shortage in supply, or the cost to manufacture our products may increase to the point where it may adversely affect the cost of
 our product candidates. We cannot assure you that our CMO will be able to manufacture our product candidates at a suitable scale,
 or we will be able to find alternative manufacturers acceptable to us that can do so; 

our
 CMO placing a priority on the manufacture of their own products, or other customers products; 

our
 CMO failing to perform as agreed upon or not remain in business; and 

our
 CMO s plants being closed as a result of regulatory sanctions, natural disasters, health epidemics or otherwise. 

Manufacturers
of pharmaceutical products are subject to ongoing periodic inspections by the FDA, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and corresponding
state and foreign agencies to ensure strict compliance with FDA mandated cGMP, other government regulations and corresponding foreign
standards. While we are obligated to audit their performance, we do not have control over our CMO s compliance with these regulations
and standards. Failure by any of our CMOs, or us, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us
or the CMOs. These sanctions may include fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of the government to grant pre-market approval
of drugs, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, seizures or recalls of product, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions,
any of which could significantly and adversely affect our business. 

In
the event that we need to change our CMOs, our pre-clinical studies, clinical trials or the commercialization of our product candidates
could be delayed, adversely affected or terminated, or such a change may result in significantly higher costs. 

Various
steps in the manufacture of our product candidates may need to be sole-sourced. In accordance with cGMP, changing manufacturers may require
the re-validation of manufacturing processes and procedures, and may require further pre-clinical studies or clinical trials to show
comparability between the materials produced by different manufacturers. Changing our current or future CMOs may be difficult for us
and could be costly, which could result in our inability to manufacture our product candidates for an extended period of time and therefore
a delay in the development of our product candidates. Further, in order to maintain our development time lines in the event of a change
in our CMOs, we may incur significantly higher costs to manufacture our product candidates. 

We
may have conflicts with our future partners that could delay or prevent the development or commercialization of our product candidates. 

We
may have conflicts with our future partners, such as conflicts concerning the interpretation of pre-clinical or clinical data, the achievement
of milestones, the interpretation of contractual obligations, payments for services, development obligations or the ownership of intellectual
property developed during our collaboration. If any conflicts arise with any of our partners, such partner may act in a manner that is
adverse to our best interests. Any such disagreement could result in one or more of the following, each of which could delay or prevent
the development or commercialization of our product candidates, and in turn prevent us from generating revenues: unwillingness on the
part of a partner to pay us milestone payments or royalties we believe are due to us under a collaboration; uncertainty regarding ownership
of intellectual property rights arising from our collaborative activities, which could prevent us from entering into additional collaborations;
unwillingness by the partner to cooperate in the development or manufacture of the product, including providing us with product data
or materials; unwillingness on the part of a partner to keep us informed regarding the progress of its development and commercialization
activities or to permit public disclosure of the results of those activities; initiating of litigation or alternative dispute resolution
options by either party to resolve the dispute; or attempts by either party to terminate the agreement. 

68 

We
may not be able to conduct, or contract others to conduct, animal testing in the future, which could harm our research and development
activities. 

Certain
laws and regulations relating to drug development require us to test our drug candidates on animals before initiating clinical trials
involving humans. Animal testing activities have been the subject of controversy and adverse publicity. Animal rights groups and other
organizations and individuals have attempted to stop animal testing activities by pressing for legislation and regulation in these areas
and by disrupting these activities through protests and other means. To the extent the activities of these groups are successful, our
research and development activities may be interrupted or delayed. 

If
any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval, the approved products may not achieve broad market acceptance among physicians,
patients, the medical community and third-party payors, in which case revenue generated from their sales would be limited. 

The
commercial success of our product candidates will depend upon their acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community.
The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including: 

limitations
 or warnings contained in the approved labeling for a product candidate; 

changes
 in the standard of care for the targeted indications for any of our product candidates; 

limitations
 in the approved clinical indications for our product candidates; 

demonstrated
 clinical safety and efficacy compared to other products; 

lack
 of significant adverse side effects; 

sales,
 marketing and distribution support; 

availability
 of coverage and reimbursement amounts from managed care plans and other third-party payors; 

timing
 of market introduction and perceived effectiveness of competitive products; 

the
 cost-effectiveness of our product candidates; 

availability
 of alternative products at similar or lower cost, including generic and over-the-counter products; 

the
 extent to which the product candidate is approved for inclusion on formularies of hospitals and managed care organizations; 

whether
 the product is designated under physician treatment guidelines as a first-line therapy or as a second- or third-line therapy for
 particular diseases; 

whether
 the product can be used effectively with other therapies to achieve higher response rates; 

adverse
 publicity about our product candidates or favorable publicity about competitive products; 

convenience
 and ease of administration of our products; and 

potential
 product liability claims. 

If
any of our product candidates are approved, but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients and the medical
community, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products, and we may not become or remain profitable. In addition, efforts
to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and
may never be successful. 

69 

Even
if we receive regulatory approval to commercialize any of the product candidates that we develop, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory
obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. 

Any
regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which
the product may be marketed or subject to certain conditions of approval, and may contain requirements for potentially costly post-approval
trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the marketed product. 

For
any approved product, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and extensive oversight by regulatory authorities, including
with respect to manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion
and recordkeeping for the product. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-approval information and reports,
as well as continued compliance with cGMP and cGCP for any clinical trials that we conduct post- approval. Later discovery of previously
unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with third-party manufacturers or
manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things: 

restrictions
 on the marketing or manufacturing of the product; 

withdrawal
 of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory product recalls; 

fines,
 warning letters or holds on clinical trials; 

refusal
 by the FDA, European Medicines Agency EMA or another competent regulatory authority to approve pending applications
 or supplements to approved applications filed by us, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 

product
 seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and 

injunctions
 or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

Occurrence
of any of the foregoing could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, the FDA s
or other regulatory authority s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit
or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the
adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval
that we may have obtained, which could adversely affect our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability. 

If
any product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit
commercialization of our product candidates. 

We
face an inherent risk of product liability lawsuits related to the testing of our product candidates in seriously ill patients, and will
face an even greater risk if product candidates are approved by regulatory authorities and commercialized. Product liability claims may
be brought against us by participants enrolled in our clinical trials, patients, health care providers or others using, administering
or selling any of our future approved products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against any such claims, we may incur substantial
liabilities. Regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in: 

decreased
 demand for any future approved products; 

injury
 to our reputation; 

withdrawal
 of clinical trial participants; 

termination
 of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs; 

70 

increased
 regulatory scrutiny; 

significant
 litigation costs; 

substantial
 monetary awards to or costly settlement with patients or other claimants; 

product
 recalls or a change in the indications for which products may be used; 

loss
 of revenue; 

diversion
 of management and scientific resources from our business operations; and 

the
 inability to commercialize our product candidates. 

If
any of our product candidates are approved for commercial sale, we will be highly dependent upon consumer perceptions of us and the safety
and quality of our products. We could be adversely affected if we are subject to negative publicity. We could also be adversely affected
if any of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies prove to be, or are asserted to be, harmful to patients.
Because of our dependence upon consumer perceptions, any adverse publicity associated with illness or other adverse effects resulting
from patients use or misuse of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies could have a material adverse
impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 

Insurance
coverage is becoming increasingly expensive. As a result, we may be unable to maintain or obtain sufficient insurance at a reasonable
cost to protect us against losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business. A successful product liability claim or
series of claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed any insurance coverage we may have, could decrease our cash resources
and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. 

Current
and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates
and affect the prices we may obtain for such product candidates. 

In
the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes
regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval for our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval
activities and affect our ability to profitably sell our product candidates. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand
post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We do not know whether additional
legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact
of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress
of the FDA s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product
labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. 

In
the United States, the Medicare Modernization Act MMA changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products.
The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on
average sales prices for drugs. In addition, this legislation authorized Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to use formularies where
they can limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of
federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. These cost reduction
initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for our product candidates
and could seriously harm our business. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow
Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results
from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. 

71 

The
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively,
the Health Care Reform Law is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth
of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance
industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The Health Care Reform Law
revised the definition of average manufacturer price for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid
drug rebates to states. Further, the law imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription
drug products. 

The
Health Care Reform Law remains subject to legislative efforts to repeal, modify or delay the implementation of the law. However, if the
Health Care Reform Law is repealed or modified, or if implementation of certain aspects of the Health Care Reform Law are delayed, such
repeal, modification or delay may materially adversely impact our business, strategies, prospects, operating results or financial condition.
We are unable to predict the full impact of any repeal, modification or delay in the implementation of the Health Care Reform Law on
us at this time. Due to the substantial regulatory changes that will need to be implemented by the Centers for Medicare Medicaid
Services and others, and the numerous processes required to implement these reforms, we cannot predict which healthcare initiatives will
be implemented at the federal or state level, the timing of any such reforms, or the effect such reforms or any other future legislation
or regulation will have on our business. 

In
addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Health Care Reform Law was enacted.
We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that
federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value
of certain development projects and reduce or eliminate our profitability. 

If
we fail to comply with healthcare regulations, we could face substantial enforcement actions, including civil and criminal penalties
and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 

As
a company involved in the healthcare industry, our business activities are subject to substantial governmental regulation. There are
significant costs involved in complying with these laws and regulations. If we are found to have violated any applicable laws or regulations,
we could be subject to civil or criminal damages, fines, sanctions or penalties, including exclusion from participation in government
healthcare programs, such as Medicare, and we may be required to change our method of operations and business strategy. A federal, state,
local or foreign government could determine that we are not operating in accordance with the law, or whether, when or how the laws, or
the interpretation thereof, will change in the future and impact our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
Any of these possibilities, if they occur, could adversely affect us. 

The
laws to which we will be subject and which could impact our business activities include the following. 

federal
 and state healthcare program anti-kickback laws (including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and Civil Monetary Penalties Law) prohibit
 among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral
 of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under
 federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Such anti-kickback laws can be implicated by, among other
 activities, marketing arrangements with ordering providers, discount or rebate programs or other inducements to purchase our products.
 Violation of these laws can result in criminal prosecution and imposition of criminal penalties and fines, as well civil monetary
 penalties and multiple damage judgments, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs; 

the
 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 1395nn) prohibit referrals by ordering
 by a physician of designated health services which include pharmaceuticals and drugs that are payable, in whole or
 in part, by Medicare or Medicaid, to an entity in which the physician or the physician s immediate family member has an investment
 interest or other financial relationship, subject to several exceptions. Financial relationships that are implicated by the Stark
 Law can include arrangements ranging from marketing arrangements and consulting agreements to medical director agreements with physicians
 who order our products. The Stark Law also prohibits billing for services rendered pursuant to a prohibited referral. Several states
 have enacted laws similar to the Stark Law. These state laws may cover all (not just Medicare and Medicaid) patients. If we violate
 the Stark Law, our financial results and operations could be adversely affected. Penalties for violations include denial of payment
 for the services, significant civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 

72 

federal
 false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented,
 claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to entities
 like us which provide coding and billing information to customers; 

HIPAA
 which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of protected health information which includes
 individually identifiable health information, demographic data, medical histories and test results; 

the
 Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act which among other things, strictly regulates drug manufacturing and product marketing, prohibits
 manufacturers from marketing drug products for off-label use and regulates the distribution of drug samples; and 

The
 Physician Payments Sunshine Act which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment
 is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually
 to the CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists,
 podiatrists, and chiropractors), certain other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and
 teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and applicable group
 purchasing organizations; 

state
 law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as, Stark Law, anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items
 or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, state laws that require pharmaceutical companies
 to comply with the pharmaceutical industry s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated
 by the federal government, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers
 of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures, or drug pricing, state and local laws that require
 the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information
 in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus
 complicating compliance efforts. 

If
our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any governmental regulations that apply to us, we may
be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business
and our financial results. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these
laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against
it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert management s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover,
achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security and fraud laws may prove costly. 

If
we are unable to effectively adapt to changes in the healthcare industry, our business may be harmed. 

Federal,
state and local legislative bodies frequently pass legislation and promulgate regulations relating to healthcare reform or that affect
the healthcare industry. As has been the trend in recent years, it is reasonable to assume that there will continue to be increased government
oversight and regulation of the healthcare industry in the future. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any new
healthcare legislation or regulations, nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of potential new legislation or regulations
on our business. It is possible that future legislation enacted by Congress or state legislatures, or regulations promulgated by regulatory
authorities at the federal or state level, could adversely affect our business. It is also possible that the changes to federal healthcare
program reimbursements to providers who purchase our products may serve as precedent to possible changes in other payors reimbursement
policies in a manner adverse to us. Similarly, changes in private payor reimbursements could lead to adverse changes in federal healthcare
programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. 

73 

There
can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully address changes in the current regulatory environment. Some of the healthcare
laws and regulations applicable to us are subject to limited or evolving interpretations, and a review of our business or operations
by a court, law enforcement or a regulatory authority might result in a determination that could have a material adverse effect on us.
Furthermore, the healthcare laws and regulations applicable to us may be amended or interpreted in a manner that could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. 

Risks
Relating to our Business and Operations 

We
may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate and fail to capitalize on product candidates that may be more
profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. 

Because
we have limited financial and managerial resources, we intend to prioritize our efforts on specific research and development programs,
including clinical development of NXC-201, IMX-110, IMX-111 and IMX-120 or other future product candidates. As a result, we may forgo
or delay pursuit of other opportunities, including with potential future product candidates that later prove to have greater commercial
potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities.
Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any
commercially viable drug candidates. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product
candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through partnership, licensing or other royalty arrangements in
cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate. 

If
the market opportunities for our current and potential future product candidates are smaller than we believe they are, our ability to
generate product revenue may be adversely affected and our business may suffer. 

Our
understanding of the number of people who suffer from certain types of cancers, hematologic malignancies and inflammatory diseases as
well as ulcerative colitis and Crohn s disease that our product candidates may have the potential to treat is based on estimates.
These estimates may prove to be incorrect, and new studies may demonstrate or suggest a lower estimated incidence or prevalence of such
diseases. The number of patients in the United States or elsewhere may turn out to be lower than expected, may not be otherwise amenable
to treatment with our current or potential future product candidates or patients may become increasingly difficult to identify and access,
all of which would adversely affect our business prospects and financial condition. 

Our
products will face significant competition, and if they are unable to compete successfully, our business will suffer. 

We
compete in an industry that is characterized by: (i) rapid technological
change, (ii) evolving industry standards, (iii) emerging competition, (iv) new product introductions and (v) an emphasis on proprietary
and novel products and product candidates. Our competitors, some of which include larger pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies,
and academic institutions, have and may develop products and technologies that will compete with our products and technologies. Specifically,
we face competition from companies developing therapies for both oncology and inflammation some of which include Kymera Therapeutics Inc.,
Morphic Holding Inc., and RAPT Therapeutics Inc. In addition, we face competition from companies developing therapies for IBD (including
UC and CD) some of which include Arena Pharmaceuticals Inc., Landos Biopharma Inc., and Seres Therapeutics Inc. Moreover, companies with
approved therapies and that are developing therapies for soft tissue sarcoma include, but are not limited to, BioAtla Inc., Epizyme Inc.,
Nanobiotix SA, C4 Therapeutics, Inc., Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc, Eisai, Novartis, and Janssen/Johnson Johnson, and a company
developing multi-kinase inhibitors is Mirati Therapeutics, Inc. We also face competition from companies developing CAR-Ts targeting multiple
myeloma, some of which include Janssen/Johnson Johnson, Bristol Myers Squibb, and Arcellx, Inc. and companies developing therapies
for AL amyloidosis some of which include Prothena Corp, Caelum Biosciences (Now Alexion/AstraZeneca), and Janssen/Johnson Johnson.
We also compete with these organizations to recruit management, scientists and clinical development personnel, which could negatively
affect our level of expertise and our ability to execute our business plan. We will also face competition in establishing clinical trial
sites, enrolling subjects for clinical trials and in identifying new product candidates. 

74 

We
believe that a significant number of products are currently under development, and may become commercially available in the future, for
the treatment of conditions for which we may attempt to develop product candidates. In addition, our products may need to compete with
drugs physicians use off-label to treat the indications for which we seek approval. This may make it difficult for us to replace existing
therapies with our products. 

Our
commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective,
have fewer side effects, are more convenient, have a broader label, are marketed more effectively, are more widely reimbursed or are
less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other comparable
foreign regulatory authorities for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors
establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Even if the product candidates we develop achieve marketing
approval, they may be priced at a significant premium over competitive products if any have been approved by then, resulting in reduced
competitiveness. Technological advances or products developed by our competitors may render our technologies or product candidates obsolete,
less competitive or not economical. 

Because
several competing companies and institutions have greater financial resources than us, they may be able to: (i) provide broader services
and product lines, (ii) make greater investments in research and development and (iii) carry on larger research and development initiatives.
Our competitors also have greater development capabilities than we do and have substantially greater experience in undertaking pre-clinical
and clinical testing of products, obtaining regulatory approvals, and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. They may also
have greater name recognition and better access to customers than us. 

Security
breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business or protected health information
or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation. 

In
the ordinary course of our business, we may collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected health information, personally
identifiable information, intellectual property and proprietary business information. We manage and maintain our applications and data
by utilizing cloud-based data center systems. These applications and data may encompass a wide variety of business-critical information,
including research and development information, commercial information and business and financial information. We face risks relative
to protecting this critical information, including loss of access risk, inappropriate disclosure risk, inappropriate modification risk
and the risk of being unable to adequately monitor our controls. 

Our
information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or viruses or breached due to employee error, malfeasance
or other disruptions. Any such breach or interruption could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed
by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in
legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, such as the federal privacy rules
for health information promulgated under HIPAA and regulatory penalties. There is no guarantee that we can continue to protect our systems
from breach. Unauthorized access, loss or dissemination could also disrupt our operations, including our ability to conduct our analyses,
provide test results, bill payors or providers, process claims and appeals, conduct research and development activities, collect, process
and prepare company financial information, provide information about any future products, manage the administrative aspects of our business
and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business. 

The
U.S. Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Health and Human Services enforces the HIPAA privacy and security rules and may impose
penalties for failure to comply with requirements of HIPAA. Penalties vary significantly depending on factors such as whether failure
to comply was due to willful neglect. These penalties include civil monetary penalties of 100 to 50,000 per violation, up to an annual
cap of 1,500,000 for identical violations. A person who knowingly obtains or discloses individually identifiable health information
in violation of HIPAA may face a criminal penalty of up to 50,000 per violation and up to one-year imprisonment. The criminal penalties
increase to 100,000 per violation and up to five-years imprisonment if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses, and to 250,000
per violation and up to 10-years imprisonment if the wrongful conduct involves the intent to sell, transfer, or use identifiable health
information for commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm. The U.S. Department of Justice is responsible for criminal prosecutions
under HIPAA. Furthermore, in the event of a breach as defined by HIPAA, there are reporting requirements to the Office of Civil Rights
under the HIPAA regulations as well as to affected individuals, and there may also be additional reporting requirements to other state
and federal regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission, and to the media. Issuing such notifications can be costly, time and
resource intensive, and can generate significant negative publicity. Breaches of HIPAA may also constitute contractual violations that
could lead to contractual damages or terminations. 

75 

In
addition, the interpretation and application of consumer, health-related and data protection laws in the United States, the European
Union, or EU, and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied
in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. If so, this could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we
change our practices, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, these data protection laws vary between states, may differ
from country to country, and may vary based on whether testing is performed in the United States or in another country. Complying with
these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures
in a manner adverse to our business. For example, we may be subject to privacy laws and regulations such as the European Union s
General Data Protection Regulation GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA ). These laws mandate
that companies satisfy requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data, including its use, protection, and the ability
of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. Failure to comply with GDPR requirements could result
in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue. The GDPR, CCPA, and other similar laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries
or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with, increase our operating costs, require significant management
time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines, negative publicity, or demands or orders
that we modify or cease existing business practices. 

Furthermore,
the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and
significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on other third parties for the manufacture of our
product candidates and to conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their computer systems could have a material adverse
effect on our business. 

The
outbreak of COVID-19, or a similar pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease in the United States or elsewhere, could have
a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including the execution of our pre-clinical
studies and clinical trials and the use and sufficiency of our existing cash. 

The
outbreak of COVID-19 evolved into a global pandemic and spread to many regions of the world. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our
business and operating results may continue to depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including
new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, including various variants, and the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact,
among others. 

The
spread of an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, may also result in the inability of our suppliers to deliver supplies to us on a timely
basis. We currently utilize third parties to, among other things, manufacture components of our product candidates and, in the future,
intend to utilize third parties to conduct our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. If either we or any third-party parties in the
supply chain for materials used in the production of our product candidates are adversely impacted by restrictions resulting from a health
epidemic such as COVID-19, which, among other things, resulted in quarantines and restrictions on travel, our supply chain may be disrupted,
limiting our ability to manufacture our product candidates for our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. 

Infections
and deaths related to a health epidemic may also disrupt the United States healthcare and healthcare regulatory systems as well
as other healthcare systems which could divert healthcare resources away from, or materially delay review and/or approval of our product
candidates by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. Furthermore, a health epidemic may also slow potential enrollment of current and
planned clinical trials, reduce the number of eligible patients for our current and planned clinical trials, create difficulties in recruiting
clinical site investigators and staff, divert healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, delay receiving approval
from local authorities to initiate our current and planned clinical trials, delay necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics
committees and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees,
interrupt key clinical trial activities (like site monitoring) and create difficulties in data collection and analysis, among other things. 

76 

The
spread of COVID-19, which caused a broad impact globally may have a material economic effect on our business. While the potential economic
impact brought by the pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, it has already caused, and is likely to result in further, significant
disruption of global financial markets which may reduce our ability to access capital either at all or on favorable terms. In addition,
a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from COVID-19 could materially and adversely affect our business
and the value of our common stock. 

The
ultimate impact of the current pandemic, or any other health epidemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know
the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, healthcare systems or the
global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations. 

Any
international operations we undertake may subject us to risks inherent with operations outside of the United States. 

We
intend to obtain market clearance for our product candidates in foreign markets; however, even with the cooperation of a commercialization
partner, conducting drug development in foreign countries involves inherent risks, including, but not limited to: difficulties in staffing,
funding and managing foreign operations; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; export restrictions; tariffs and other trade
barriers; difficulties in protecting, acquiring, enforcing and litigating intellectual property rights; fluctuations in currency exchange
rates; and potentially adverse tax consequences. If we were to experience any of the difficulties listed above, or any other difficulties,
our international development activities and our overall financial condition may suffer and cause us to reduce or discontinue our international
development and registration efforts. 

We
may not be successful in hiring and retaining key employees, including executive officers. 

Our
future operations and successes depend in large part upon the strength of our management team. We rely heavily on the continued service
of each member of our management team. Accordingly, if any member of our management team were to terminate their employment with us,
such departure may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, our future success depends on our ability to identify,
attract, hire or engage, retain and motivate other well-qualified financial, managerial, technical, clinical and regulatory personnel.
There can be no assurance that these professionals will be available in the market, or that we will be able to retain existing professionals
or to meet or to continue to meet their compensation requirements. Furthermore, the cost base in relation to such compensation, which
may include equity compensation, may increase significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Failure to establish and
maintain an effective management team and work force could adversely affect our ability to operate, grow and manage our business. 

Our
employees, consultants, commercial partners and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities,
including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements. 

We
are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other illegal activity by our employees, consultants, commercial
partners and vendors. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct that fails to comply with
FDA or other regulations, provide true, complete and accurate information to the FDA and other similar foreign regulatory bodies, comply
with manufacturing standards we may establish, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information
or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. If we obtain approval of any of our product candidates from the FDA or
any other foreign regulatory agency and begin commercializing those products in the United States or elsewhere, our potential exposure
under these laws will increase significantly, and our costs associated with compliance with these laws are likely to increase. In particular,
sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent
fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing,
discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct
could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions
and serious harm to our reputation. Additionally, we are subject to the risk that a person could allege such fraud or other misconduct,
even if none occurred. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and
prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental
investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are
instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a material
and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including the imposition of significant
civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations,
loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA or other regulatory agencies, exclusion from participation in government contracting,
healthcare reimbursement or other government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations,
or reputational harm. 

Because Immix Biopharma
and certain of its affiliates control a significant number of securities of Nexcella, it may have effective control over actions requiring
Nexcella stockholder approval. 

As of March 20, 2023, Immix Biopharma and certain of its affiliates (Ilya Rachman, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chairman and Gabriel Morris, our Chief Financial Officer and director) collectively own 5,044,988 shares of Nexcella s
common stock, or 98.50 of Nexcella s outstanding common stock, 1,000,000 shares of Nexcella s Class A common stock, or 100 
of Nexcella s outstanding Class A common stock and 250,000 shares of Nexcella s Class A preferred stock, or 100 of Nexcella s
outstanding Class A preferred stock. Therefore, Immix Biopharma would have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to
Nexcella s stockholders for approval. 

77 

Risks
Relating to our Intellectual Property 

It
is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights, and we may not be able to ensure their protection. If our patent position
does not adequately protect our product candidates, others could compete against us, which may have a material adverse effect on our
business. 

Our
commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of our current and
future product candidates, the processes used to manufacture them and the methods for using them, as well as successfully defending such
patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing
our product candidates is dependent upon the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that
cover these activities. 

The
patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions
for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical
patents has emerged to date in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions outside of the U.S. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretations
of patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the
breadth of claims that may be enforced in the patents that may be issued from the applications we currently or may in the future own
or license from third parties. Further, if any patents we obtain or license are deemed invalid and unenforceable, our ability to commercialize
or license our products or technologies could be adversely affected. 

Others
have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications covering products and technologies that are similar, identical
or competitive to ours or important to our business. We cannot be certain that any patent application owned by a third party will not
have priority over patent applications filed or in-licensed by us, or that we or our future licensors will not be involved in interference,
opposition, reexamination, review, reissue, post grant review or invalidity proceedings before U.S. or non-U.S. patent offices. 

The
degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately
protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example: 

others
 may be able to make compounds that are similar to our product candidates, but that are not covered by the claims of our patents; 

we
 might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by our pending patent applications; 

we
 might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions; 

our
 pending patent applications may not result in issued patents; 

the
 claims of our issued patents or patent applications when issued may not cover our products or product candidates; 

any
 patents that we may obtain from licensing or otherwise may not provide us with any competitive advantages; 

any
 granted patents that we rely upon may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges by third parties; and 

the
 patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business. 

78 

If
we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we may license intellectual property rights from third parties or
otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our potential licensors, we could lose rights that are important
to our business. 

We
have and may, in the future, be required to enter into intellectual property license agreements that are important to our business. These
license agreements may impose various diligence, milestone payment, royalty and other obligations on us. For example, we may enter into
exclusive license agreements with various universities and research institutions, we may be required to use commercially reasonable efforts
to engage in various development and commercialization activities with respect to licensed products, and may need to satisfy specified
milestone and royalty payment obligations. If we fail to comply with any obligations under any potential agreements with any of these
licensors, we may be subject to termination of the license agreement in whole or in part; increased financial obligations to our licensors
or loss of exclusivity in a particular field or territory, in which case our ability to develop or commercialize products covered by
the license agreement will be impaired. 

In
addition, disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a license agreement, including: 

the
 scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues; 

the
 extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing
 agreement; 

our
 diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those obligations; 

if
 a third-party expresses interest in an area under a license that we are not pursuing, under the terms of certain of our license agreements,
 we may be required to sublicense rights in that area to a third party, and that sublicense could harm our business; and 

the
 ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us. 

If
disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our future licensing arrangements
on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates. 

We
may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates. We may fail
to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we would be unable to further
develop and commercialize our product candidates, which could harm our business significantly. 

We
may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patents and other intellectual property rights. 

If
we choose to commence a proceeding or litigation to prevent another party from infringing our patents, that party will have the right
to ask the examiner or court to rule that such patents are invalid or should not be enforced against them. There is a risk that the examiner
or court will decide that our patents are not valid and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the related
inventions. There is also the risk that, even if the validity of such patents is upheld, the examiner or court will refuse to stop the
other party on the ground that such other party s activities do not infringe our rights. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court has
recently modified some tests used by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office USPTO in granting patents over the past 20
years, which may decrease the likelihood that we will be able to obtain patents and increase the likelihood of challenge to any patents
we obtain or may, in the future, license. Any proceedings or litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or defend ourselves
against claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights could be costly and divert the attention of managerial and
scientific personnel, regardless of whether such litigation is ultimately resolved in our favor. We may not have sufficient resources
to bring these actions to a successful conclusion. Moreover, if we are unable to successfully defend against claims that we have infringed
the intellectual property rights of others, we may be prevented from using certain intellectual property and may be liable for damages,
which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

79 

We
may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may prevent or delay our product development efforts and stop us from
commercializing or increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates. 

Our
success will depend in part on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We cannot guarantee
that our product candidates, or manufacture or use of our product candidates, will not infringe third-party patents. Furthermore, a third
party may claim that we are using inventions covered by the third party s patent rights and may go to court to stop us from engaging
in our normal operations and activities, including making or selling our product candidates. These lawsuits are costly and could affect
our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and scientific personnel. Some of these third parties may be better
capitalized and have more resources than us. There is a risk that a court would decide that we are infringing the third party s
patents and would order us to stop the activities covered by the patents. In that event, we may not have a viable way around the patent
and may need to halt commercialization of our product candidates. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us to pay the
other party damages for having violated the other party s patents. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have produced
a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products
or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. 

If
we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our product candidates or methods either do not infringe the patent
claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity is difficult.
For example, in the U.S., proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity
enjoyed by issued patents. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and divert management s
time and attention in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. If we are unable to avoid infringing
the patent rights of others, we may be required to seek a license, which may not be available, defend an infringement action or challenge
the validity of the patents in court. Patent litigation is costly and time consuming. We may not have sufficient resources to bring these
actions to a successful conclusion. In addition, if we do not obtain a license, develop or obtain non-infringing technology, fail to
defend an infringement action successfully or have infringed patents declared invalid, we may incur substantial monetary damages, encounter
significant delays in bringing our product candidates to market and be precluded from manufacturing or selling our product candidates. 

We
cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending applications, or that we are the
first to invent the technology, because: 

some
 patent applications in the U.S. may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued; 

patent
 applications in the U.S. are typically not published until 18 months after the priority date; and 

publications
 in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries. 

Our
competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering products and technology similar to ours. Any such
patent application may have priority over our patent applications, which could require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering
such products or technologies. If another party has filed U.S. patent applications on inventions similar to us that claims priority to
any applications filed prior to the priority dates of our applications, we may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared
by the USPTO to determine priority of invention in the U.S. It is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful if, unbeknownst to
us, the other party had independently arrived at the same or similar inventions prior to our inventions, resulting in a loss of our U.S.
patent position with respect to such inventions which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our operations. Other countries
have similar laws that permit secrecy of patent applications, and may be entitled to priority over our applications in such jurisdictions. 

80 

Some
of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than us because they have substantially
greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material
adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations. 

If
we are not able to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information, the value of our technology and
products could be significantly diminished. 

We
also rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary products and technologies, especially where we do not believe patent protection
is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our
employees, consultants and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively
prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential
information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. Costly and time-consuming
litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret
protection could adversely affect our business. 

We
may be subject to claims that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged
trade secrets. 

As is common in the biotechnology
and pharmaceutical industries, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies,
including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees or consultants do not use the proprietary
information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees or consultants have inadvertently
or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to
defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we could lose valuable intellectual
property rights or personnel, which could adversely impact our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims,
litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. 

Our
intellectual property may not be sufficient to protect our product candidates from competition, which may negatively affect our business. 

We
may be subject to competition despite the existence of intellectual property we own or in the future may license. We can give no assurances
that our intellectual property claims will be sufficient to prevent third parties from designing around patents we own or may in the
future license and developing and commercializing competitive products. The existence of competitive products that avoid our intellectual
property could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, limitations, or perceived limitations,
in our intellectual property may limit the interest of third parties to partner, collaborate or otherwise transact with us, if third
parties perceive a higher than acceptable risk to commercialization of our product candidates. 

We
may elect to sue a third party, or otherwise make a claim, alleging infringement or other violation of patents, trademarks, trade dress,
copyrights, trade secrets, domain names or other intellectual property rights that we either own or license from a third party. If we
do not prevail in enforcing our intellectual property rights in this type of litigation, we may be subject to: 

paying
 monetary damages related to the legal expenses of the third party; 

facing
 additional competition that may have a significant adverse effect on our product pricing, market share, business operations, financial
 condition, and the commercial viability of our products; and 

restructuring
 our Company or delaying or terminating select business opportunities, including, but not limited to, research and development, clinical
 trial, and commercialization activities, due to a potential deterioration of our financial condition or market competitiveness. 

81 

A
third party may also challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of the intellectual property rights that we own or in the future
may license; and, the result of these challenges may narrow the scope or claims of or invalidate patents that are integral to our product
candidates. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully defend patents we own or may license in an action against
third parties due to the unpredictability of litigation and the high costs associated with intellectual property litigation, amongst
other factors. 

Intellectual
property rights and enforcement may be less extensive in jurisdictions outside of the U.S.; thus, we may not be able to protect our intellectual
property and third parties may be able to market competitive products that may use some or all of our intellectual property. 

Changes
to patent law, including the Leahy-Smith America Invests Act, AIA or Leahy-Smith Act, of 2011 and the Patent Reform Act of 2009 and other
future article of legislation, may substantially change the regulations and procedures surrounding patent applications, issuance of patents,
and prosecution of patents. We can give no assurances that our patents can be defended or will protect us against future intellectual
property challenges, particularly as they pertain to changes in patent law and future patent law interpretations. 

In
addition, enforcing and maintaining our intellectual property protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission,
fee payment and other requirements imposed by the USPTO, courts and foreign government patent agencies, and our patent protection could
be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements which may have a material adverse effect on our business. 

We
conduct certain research and development operations through our Australian wholly-owned subsidiary. If we lose our ability to operate
in Australia, or if our subsidiary is unable to receive the research and development tax credit allowed by Australian regulations, our
business and results of operations could suffer. 

In August 2016, we formed a wholly-owned
Australian subsidiary, Immix Biopharma Australia Pty Ltd to conduct various pre-clinical and clinical activities for our product and development
candidates in Australia. We may not be able to efficiently or successfully monitor, develop and commercialize our lead products in Australia,
including conducting clinical trials. Furthermore, we have no assurance that the results of any clinical trials that we conduct for our
product candidates in Australia will be accepted by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for development and commercialization approvals. 

In
addition, current Australian tax regulations provide for a refundable research and development tax credit equal to 43.5 of qualified
expenditures. If we lose our ability to operate IBAPL in Australia, or if we are ineligible or unable to receive the research and development
tax credit, or the Australian government significantly reduces or eliminates the tax credit, our business and results of operation may
be adversely affected. 

Breakthrough Therapy Designation, Fast
Track Designation or RPDD by the FDA, and equivalents granted by other regulatory authorities, even if granted for any of our
product candidates developed for therapeutic indications, may not lead to a faster development, regulatory review or approval
process, and it does not increase the likelihood that any of our product candidates will receive marketing approval in any
jurisdiction. 

We may seek a Breakthrough Therapy Designation for some of our product
candidates. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a therapy that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other therapies,
to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate
substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects
observed early in clinical development. For therapies that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication
between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the
number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Therapies designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA may also be eligible
for priority review and accelerated approval. Designation as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly,
even if we believe one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree and
instead determine not to make such designation. In any event, the receipt of a Breakthrough Therapy Designation for a product candidate
may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to therapies considered for approval under conventional FDA
procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our product candidates qualify as breakthrough
therapies, the FDA may later decide that such product candidates no longer meet the conditions for qualification or decide that the time
period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 

We may seek Fast Track Designation for some of our product candidates
for therapeutic indications. If a therapy is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the therapy demonstrates
the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the therapy sponsor may apply for Fast Track Designation. Filling an unmet medical need is defined as providing a therapy where none
exists or providing a therapy which may be potentially better than available therapy. The FDA has
broad discretion whether or not to grant this designation, so even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for this designation,
we cannot assure you that the FDA would decide to grant it. Even if we do receive Fast Track Designation, we may not experience a faster
development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. The FDA may withdraw Fast Track Designation if it believes
that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. Fast Track Designation alone does not guarantee
qualification for the FDA s priority review procedures. 

We may seek a RPDD for some of
our product candidates. However, even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for this designation, we cannot guarantee
that FDA would agree. The FDA may award priority review vouchers to sponsors of products that meet the definition of a rare
pediatric disease. A rare pediatric disease is a (a) serious or life-threatening disease in which the
serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years, including age groups often called
neonates, infants, children, and adolescents; and (b) rare disease or conditions within the meaning of the Orphan Drug Act. 
However, this designation is at the discretion of the FDA and, even if we do receive a Rare Pediatric Disease Designation, we may
not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures and are still not guaranteed final
approval of our product candidate by the FDA. Additionally, the benefits of a RPDD may not be available for future product candidates.
After September 30, 2024, the FDA may only award a voucher for an approved rare pediatric disease product application if the sponsor has
a RPDD for the drug that was granted by September 30, 2024. After September 30, 2026, the FDA may not award any additional rare pediatric
disease priority review vouchers. 

Risks
Related to Owning our Common Stock 

The
price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially. 

You
should consider an investment in our common stock to be risky, and you should invest in our common stock only if you can withstand a
significant loss and wide fluctuations in the market value of your investment. Some factors that may cause the market price of our common
stock to fluctuate, in addition to the other risks mentioned in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, are: 

sales
 of our common stock by our stockholders, executives, and directors; 

volatility
 and limitations in trading volumes of our shares of common stock; 

82 

our
 ability to obtain financing to conduct and complete research and development activities including, but not limited to, our clinical
 trials, and other business activities; 

possible
 delays in the expected recognition of revenue due to lengthy and sometimes unpredictable sales timelines; 

the
 timing and success of introductions of new products by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our
 industry, including consolidation among competitors, customers or strategic partners; 

network
 outages or security breaches; 

our
 ability to attract new customers; 

our
 ability to secure resources and the necessary personnel to conduct clinical trials on our desired schedule; 

commencement,
 enrollment or results of our clinical trials for our product candidates or any future clinical trials we may conduct; 

changes
 in the development status of our product candidates; 

any
 delays or adverse developments or perceived adverse developments with respect to the FDA or other regulatory agencies review
 of our planned pre-clinical and clinical trials; 

any
 delay in our submission for studies or product approvals or adverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory
 approval for our product candidates; 

unanticipated
 safety concerns related to the use of our product candidates; 

failures
 to meet external expectations or management guidance; 

changes
 in our capital structure or dividend policy or future issuances of securities; 

our
 cash position; 

announcements
 and events surrounding financing efforts, including debt and equity securities; 

our
 inability to enter into new markets or develop new products; 

reputational
 issues; 

competition
 from existing technologies and products or new technologies and products that may emerge; 

announcements
 of acquisitions, partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, new products, capital commitments, or other events by us or our competitors; 

changes
 in general economic, political and market conditions in or any of the regions in which we conduct our business; 

changes
 in industry conditions or perceptions; 

changes
 in valuations of similar companies or groups of companies; 

analyst
 research reports, recommendation and changes in recommendations, price targets, and withdrawals of coverage; 

departures
 and additions of key personnel; 

83 

disputes
 and litigations related to intellectual properties, proprietary rights, and contractual obligations; 

changes
 in applicable laws, rules, regulations, or accounting practices and other dynamics; and 

other
 events or factors, many of which may be out of our control. 

In
addition, if the market for stocks in our industry or industries related to our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences
a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition
and results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that,
even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management. 

We
are currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. If we are unable to maintain listing of our securities on Nasdaq or any stock exchange,
our stock price could be adversely affected and the liquidity of our stock and our ability to obtain financing could be impaired and
it may be more difficult for our stockholders to sell their securities. 

Although
our common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, we may not be able to continue to meet the exchange s minimum
listing requirements or those of any other national exchange. If we are unable to maintain listing on Nasdaq or if a liquid market for
our common stock does not develop or is sustained, our common stock may remain thinly traded. 

The
Listing Rules of Nasdaq require listing issuers to comply with certain standards in order to remain listed on its exchange. If, for any
reason, we should fail to maintain compliance with these listing standards and Nasdaq should delist our securities from trading on its
exchange and we are unable to obtain listing on another national securities exchange, a reduction in some or all of the following may
occur, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our shareholders: 

the
 liquidity of our common stock; 

the
 market price of our common stock; 

our
 ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations; 

the
 number of investors that will consider investing in our common stock; 

the
 number of market makers in our common stock; 

the
 availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of our common stock; and 

the
 number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in shares of our common stock. 

Because
certain of our stockholders control a significant number of shares of our common stock, they may have effective control over actions
requiring stockholder approval. 

As
of March 17, 2023, our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders, and their respective affiliates, beneficially own approximately
64.73 of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to control
the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation
or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to control
the management and affairs of our Company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership might harm the market price of our common stock
by: 

delaying,
 deferring or preventing a change in corporate control; 

impeding
 a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or 

discouraging
 a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. 

84 

We
do not intend to pay cash dividends on our shares of common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our shares. 

We
currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate
declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, any future debt agreements may also preclude us from paying
or place restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends will be
at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on factors the board of directors deems relevant, including among others,
our results of operations, financial condition and cash requirements, business prospects, and the terms of any of our financing arrangements.
Therefore, any return to stockholders may be limited to the increase, if any, of our share price. There is no guarantee
that our stock will appreciate in value. 

Our
third amended and restated certificate of incorporation Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our amended
and restated bylaws (the Amended and Restated Bylaws and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage,
delay or prevent a change in control, which may cause our stock price to decline. 

Our
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for
a third party to acquire us, even if closing such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders. We are authorized to issue up
to 10 million shares of preferred stock. This preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined
at the time of issuance by our board of directors without further action by stockholders. The terms of any series of preferred stock
may include voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as to dividend, liquidation, conversion
and redemption rights and sinking fund provisions. The issuance of any preferred stock could materially adversely affect the rights of
the holders of our common stock, and therefore, reduce the value of our common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future
holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell our assets to, a third party and thereby preserve
control by the present management. 

Provisions
of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws and Delaware law also could have the effect
of discouraging potential acquisition proposals or making a tender offer or delaying or preventing a change in control, including changes
a stockholder might consider favorable. Such provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove
our management. In particular, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws and Delaware law,
as applicable, among other things: 

provide
 the board of directors with the ability to alter our Amended and Restated Bylaws without stockholder approval; 

place
 limitations on the removal of directors; 

establish
 advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon
 at stockholder meetings; and 

provide
 that vacancies on the board of directors may be filled by a majority of directors in office, although less than a quorum. 

Our
Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially
all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for
disputes with the us or our directors, officers or employees. 

Our
Certificate of Incorporation provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the State of Delaware
is the sole and exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, (ii) any action asserting a claim
of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of our Company to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action
asserting a claim against us, our directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation
Law (the DGCL or our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or our Amended and Restated Bylaws, or (iv) any
action asserting a claim against us, our directors, officers, employees or agents governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for,
as to each of (i) through (iv) above, any claim as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not
subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other
than the Court of Chancery, or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. This exclusive forum provision
would not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or any other claim
for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. To the extent that any such claims may be based upon federal law claims, Section
27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the
Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. 

85 

Section
22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability
created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. However, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
contains a federal forum provision which provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal
district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of
action arising under the Securities Act. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital
stock are deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision. 

These
choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes
with us or our directors, officers or other employees and may result in increased costs to our stockholders, which may discourage such
lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find our choice of forum provisions
contained in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional
costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial
condition. 

Failure
to maintain effective internal controls could cause our investors to lose confidence in us and adversely affect the market price of our
common stock. If our internal controls are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. 

Effective
internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports in a timely manner. Our management
concluded there was a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 as, due to our small
size, and our limited number of personnel, we did not have in place an effective internal control environment with formal processes and
procedures, including journal entry processing and review, to allow for a detailed review of accounting transactions that would identify
errors in a timely manner. A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or a combination of significant deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting such that it is reasonably possible that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

We have implemented additional
review procedures including addition of accounting consultants to remediate such weakness. While we believe that our remediation efforts
will resolve the identified material weakness, there is no assurance that such efforts will be sufficient or that additional actions will
not be necessary, which may undermine our ability to provide accurate, timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results.
Furthermore, if we remediate our current material weakness but identify new material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price
of our common stock may be negatively affected. As a result of such failures, we could also become subject to investigations by Nasdaq,
the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, and become subject to litigation from investors and stockholders, which could harm our reputation,
financial condition or divert financial and management resources from our business. 

General
Risk Factors 

Market
and economic conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition and share price. 

Concerns
over medical epidemics, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the U.S. mortgage market and a deteriorating real estate market, unstable
global credit markets and financial conditions, and volatile oil prices have led to periods of significant economic instability, diminished
liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence and discretionary spending, diminished expectations for the global
economy and expectations of slower global economic growth, increased unemployment rates, and increased credit defaults in recent years.
Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturns, volatile business environments and continued
unstable or unpredictable economic and market conditions. If these conditions continue to deteriorate or do not improve, it may make
any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to complete, more costly, and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing
in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance, and share
price and could require us to delay or abandon development or commercialization plans. 

86 

If
securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports, or publish unfavorable research or reports about our business, our
stock price and trading volume may decline. 

The
trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us,
our business, our markets and our competitors. We do not control these analysts. If securities analysts do not cover our common stock,
the lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts
who do cover us downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary about us or our business, our stock price
would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose
visibility in the market and interest in our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline
and may also impair our ability to expand our business with existing customers and attract new customers. 

Future
sales and issuances of our common stock could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could
cause our share price to fall. In addition, the perception that sales of our common stock could occur, could cause our stock price to fall. 

We
expect that significant additional capital will be needed to continue our planned operations, including increased marketing, hiring new
personnel, commercializing our products, and continuing activities as an operating public company. To the extent we raise additional
capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities
or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock,
convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales.
Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing
stockholders. Furthermore, sales of a substantial number of our shares of common stock in the public markets or the perception
that such sales could occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale
of additional equity securities. 

The number of shares of our common stock available
for future issuance or sale could adversely affect the per share trading price of our common stock. 

We cannot predict whether future
issuances or sales of our common stock or the availability of shares for resale in the open market will decrease the per share trading
price of our common stock. The issuance of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that
such issuances might occur could adversely affect the per share trading price of our common stock. 

We
are an emerging growth company and will be able to avail ourselves of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging
growth companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors. 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various
reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including not
being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations
regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding
advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition,
pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company we intend to take advantage of the extended transition
period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words,
an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions.
If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and
our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth
company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in
which we have total annual gross revenues of 1.235 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary
of the date of the completion of our initial public offering; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in nonconvertible
debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the
SEC. 

87 

We
may be at risk of securities class action litigation. 

We
may be at risk of securities class action litigation. In the past, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant
stock price volatility, particularly when associated with binary events such as clinical trials and product approvals. If we face such
litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources, which could harm our
business and results in a decline in the market price of our common stock. 

Financial
reporting obligations of being a public company in the U.S. are expensive and time-consuming, and our management will be required to
devote substantial time to compliance matters. 

As
a publicly traded company we incur significant additional legal, accounting and other expenses. The obligations of being a public company
in the U.S. require significant expenditures and place significant demands on our management and other personnel, including costs resulting
from public company reporting obligations under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations regarding corporate governance practices,
including those under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the listing requirements
of The Nasdaq Capital Market. These rules require the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and
procedures, internal control over financial reporting and changes in corporate governance practices, among many other complex rules that
are often difficult to implement, monitor and maintain compliance with. Moreover, despite recent reforms made possible by the JOBS Act,
the reporting requirements, rules, and regulations will make some activities more time-consuming and costly, particularly after we are
no longer an emerging growth company or a smaller reporting company. Our management and other personnel will
need to devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of these requirements and to keep pace with new regulations,
otherwise we may fall out of compliance and risk becoming subject to litigation or being delisted, among other potential problems.

7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

You
should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and plan of operations together with and our accompanying
consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical
information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our
actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include,
but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors included elsewhere
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All amounts in this report are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. 

Overview 

We
have the following two business units: 

ImmixBio . ImmixBio is focused
on developing Tissue Specific Therapeutics targeting solid tumors and immune-dysregulated diseases. As of February 2023, 19 patients with
advanced solid tumors were treated with IMX-110, ImmixBio s lead candidate. 

Nexcella . Our majority-owned
subsidiary, Nexcella, Inc., is engaged in the discovery and development of novel
cell therapies for hematologic malignancies (blood cancers) and other indications. As of February 2023, 42 patients with relapsed/refractory
multiple myeloma (90 overall response rate at therapeutic dose) and 5 relapsed/refractory light chain (AL) amyloidosis patients (100 
organ response, 100 complete response rate) have been treated with next-generation CAR-T NXC-201. 

Since
inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing product and technology rights, conducting research and development,
organizing and staffing our Company, business planning and raising capital. We operate as one business segment and have incurred recurring
losses, the majority of which are attributable to research and development activities and negative cash flows from operations. We have
funded our operations primarily through the sale of convertible debt and equity securities. Currently, our primary use of cash is to
fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures, and to a lesser extent, general and administrative
expenditures. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our product
candidates through all stages of development and clinical trials and, ultimately, seek regulatory approval. In addition, if we obtain
regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing,
marketing, sales and distribution. Furthermore, we incur costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal,
accounting, investor relations and other expenses. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year,
depending on the timing of our clinical trials and our expenses on other research and development activities. 

AxioMx
Master Services Agreement 

On
December 22, 2014, we entered into a Master Service Agreement MSA with AxioMx, Inc. AxioMx which is in
the business of developing and supplying custom affinity reagents. We entered into the MSA to serve as a master agreement governing multiple
sets of projects as may be agreed upon us and AxioMx from time to time. Pursuant to the MSA, we granted AxioMx a non-exclusive, royalty-free,
worldwide, non-transferable license to certain of our intellectual property to perform services pursuant to the MSA, and AxioMx granted
us an exclusive product assignment option Option which granted us an exclusive, royalty-bearing right, with the right
to sublicense, under the Deliverable (as defined in the MSA) to further research, develop, use, sell, offer for sale, import and export
one or more assigned products pursuant to the MSA. We exercised the Option in 2017. Pursuant to the MSA, AxioMx is entitled to royalties
on the sale of any Deliverable that is used for diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic purposes, in humans or animals, or for microbiology
testing, including food safety testing or environmental monitoring. Specifically, we shall pay AxioMx a royalty of 3.5 of Net Sales
(as defined in the MSA) of assigned products for each Deliverable used in licensed products for therapeutic purposes. In addition, we
shall pay AxioMx a royalty of 1.5 of Net Sales of assigned products for each Deliverable used in licensed products for diagnostic or
prognostic purposes; provided, however, if three Deliverables are used in an assigned product for diagnostic or prognostic purposes,
the royalty shall be 4.5 . As of December 31, 2022, the MSA has expired and we do not intend to extend the MSA; however, the royalty
obligations described herein shall survive the termination of the MSA. 

Research
and License Agreement with Hadasit and BIRAD 

On December 8, 2022, Nexcella
entered into the Agreement with the Licensors pursuant to which the Licensors granted to Nexcella an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing
license in the Territory to an invention entitled Anti-BCMA CAR-T cells to target plasma cell to develop, manufacture, have
manufactured, use, market, offer for sale, sell, have sold, export and import Licensed Product. Pursuant to the Agreement, Nexcella paid
the Licensors an upfront fee of 1,500,000 in December 2022. Additional quarterly payments totaling approximately 13.0 million are due
through September 2026 along with an annual license fee of 50,000. Nexcella has agreed to pay royalties to the Licensors equal to 5 
of Net Sales during the Royalty Period. 

In addition,
Nexcella shall pay sales milestone payments of up to 20 million for Net Sales exceeding 700 million and Nexcella has committed to funding
NXC-201 clinical trials in Israel over 4 years for an estimated total cost of approximately 13 million, spread on a quarterly basis over
that period, which Nexcella believes will generate clinical trial data owned by Nexcella. The term of the Agreement commenced on December
8, 2022 and, unless earlier terminated pursuant to the terms thereof, shall continue in full force and effect until the later of the expiration
of the last Valid Claim under a Licensed Patent or a Joint Patent or Exclusivity Right covering a Licensed Product or the expiration of
a continuous period of 15 years during which there shall not have been a First Commercial Sale of any Licensed Product in any country
in the world. Licensors may terminate the Agreement immediately if Nexcella or its affiliates or sublicensees commences an action in which
it challenges the validity, enforceability or scope of any of the Licensed Patents or Joint Patents. In addition, either party may terminate
the Agreement if the other party materially breaches the Agreement and fails to cure such breach within 30 days. Additionally, Licensors
may terminate the Agreement if Nexcella becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy.

Recent
Developments 

On January 12, 2023, Nexcella
entered into share purchase agreements with certain accredited investors for their purchase of an aggregate 100,152 shares of Nexcella s
common stock at a purchase price of 6.49 per share, for gross proceeds of approximately 650,000. In addition, our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer collectively purchased 23,112 shares of Nexcella s common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 150,000.
As a result of the foregoing offering, as of January 12, 2023, we owned 98 of Nexcella. 

On March 22, 2023, we entered into the Sales Agreement with the Sales Agent
pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, through the Sales Agent, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering
price of up to 5,000,000, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Sales Agreement. We will pay the Sales Agent a fixed commission
rate of 3.75 of the aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of the shares of our common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement. We have
paid an expense deposit of 15,000 to the Sales Agent, which will be applied against the actual out-of-pocket accountable expenses. We
have agreed to reimburse the Sales Agent for all expenses related to the offering including, without limitation, the fees and expenses
of the Sales Agent s legal counsel up to 50,000, and shall reimburse the Sales Agent, upon request, for such costs, fees and expenses
in an amount not to exceed 7,500 on a quarterly basis for the first three fiscal quarters of each year and 10,000 for the fiscal fourth
quarter of each year. The offering pursuant to the Sales Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the sale of all of the shares
of common stock subject to the Sales Agreement, and (ii) termination of the Sales Agreement as permitted therein. We may terminate
the Sales Agreement in our sole discretion at any time by giving ten days prior notice to the Sales Agent. The Sales Agent may
terminate the Sales Agreement under the circumstances specified in the Sales Agreement and in its sole discretion at any time by giving
ten days prior notice to us. In addition, the Sales Agreement may be terminated upon mutual agreement by us and the Sales Agent. 

The
COVID-19 Pandemic and its Impacts on Our Business 

In
March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a global pandemic. This pandemic could result in difficulty
securing clinical trial site locations, CROs, and/or trial monitors and other critical vendors and consultants supporting our trial.
These situations, or others associated with COVID-19, could cause delays in our clinical trial plans and could increase expected costs,
all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. At the current time, we are unable to quantify
the potential effects of this pandemic on our future consolidated financial statements. 

Results
of Operations 

Year
Ended December 31, 2022 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses were 4,023,170 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 1,225,487 for the year ended December
31, 2021. 

The
expenses incurred in both periods were related to salaries, patent maintenance costs and general accounting and other general consulting
expenses, which were higher for the year ended December 31, 2022 due to the Company becoming a fully reporting public company. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses were 4,195,778 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 126,527 for the year ended December
31, 2021. 

The
increased research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December 30, 2021,
were related to our ongoing Phase 1b/2a clinical trial, including, but not limited to, contract research organization CRO and related costs for maintaining and treating patients in the clinical trial. We were able to increase spending on research and development
as a result of closing the IPO in December 2021, and we expect to incur increased research and development costs in the future as our
product development activities expand. In addition, the Company paid 1,500,000 for an upfront license fee in connection with the Agreement. 

91 

Change
in Fair Value of Derivative Liability 

The change in fair
value of derivative liability was 0 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 22,759,829 for the year ended December 31, 2021.
The derivative liability related to the probability of a Qualified Financing (as defined in our convertible notes), was
reclassified to equity in connection with the automatic conversion of the convertible notes to shares of our common stock in connection
with our initial public offering IPO in December 2021. 

Loss on Debt Extinguishment 

In December 2021, in connection with our IPO, our convertible notes along
with the corresponding accrued interest, were automatically converted into an aggregate of 5,633,689 shares of our common stock. As a
result of the conversion, we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of 86,170. 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense was 497 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 179,853 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Interest expense in
the prior period was related to interest accrued on our convertible notes payable bearing interest at rates from the applicable federal
rate to 6 per annum, all of which were converted to shares of our common stock in connection with our IPO in December 2021. 

Provision
for Income Taxes 

Provision
for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 10,268 compared to 6,013 for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to withholding
taxes relating to our Australian subsidiary. 

Funding
Requirements 

Our
primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist of research and development expenditures and various general and administrative
expenses. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in
our outstanding accounts payable, accrued expenses and prepaid expenses. 

Because
of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are
unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors,
including, but not limited to: 

the
 scope, timing, progress and results of discovery, pre-clinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product
 candidates; 

the
 costs of manufacturing our product candidates for clinical trials and in preparation for regulatory approval and commercialization;

the
 extent to which we enter into collaborations or other arrangements with additional third parties in order to further develop our
 product candidates; 

the
 costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending
 intellectual property-related claims; 

the
 costs and fees associated with the discovery, acquisition or in-license of additional product candidates or technologies; 

expenses
 needed to attract and retain skilled personnel; 

the
 costs associated with being a public company; 

the
 costs required to scale up our clinical, regulatory and manufacturing capabilities; 

the
 costs of future commercialization activities, if any, including establishing sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities,
 for any of our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval; and 

revenue,
 if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval.

We
will need additional funds to meet our operational needs and capital requirements for clinical trials, other research and development
expenditures, and general and administrative expenses. We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital. 

92 

Until
such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity
offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding, commercialization, marketing and distribution arrangements, other
collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity
or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or
other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic
alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies,
future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are
unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit,
reduce or terminate our research, product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product
candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 

Cash
used in operating activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 7,408,303 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 1,589,307 for the year ended December 31,
2021 and primarily included CRO, clinical site costs and related logistics. 

Cash
used in investing activities 

Net
cash used by investing activities was 0 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 802 for the year ended December 31, 2021. We purchased
equipment during the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Cash
provided by financing activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 3,232,063 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 18,848,934 for the year ended December
31, 2021. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2022 was primarily related to 2,913,750 in net proceeds from the issuance of
shares of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of the underwriter s overallotment option to purchase additional shares of
our common stock in connection with our IPO completed in December 2021 and funds of 475,000 received by our subsidiary, Nexcella,
in connection with a private placement offering. We received 18,648,934 in net proceeds from the issuance of our shares of common stock
pursuant to our initial public offering during the year ended December 31, 2021, along with 200,000 in proceeds from convertible notes
payable. 

The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon its
ability to obtain continued financial support from its stockholders, necessary equity financing to continue operations and the attainment
of profitable operations. As of December 31, 2022, we have incurred an accumulated deficit of 37,985,247 and have not yet generated any
revenue from operations. Additionally, management anticipates that its cash on hand will be sufficient to fund its planned operations
for at least 12 months from the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We
will have additional capital requirements going forward and may need to seek additional financing, which may not be available to us on
acceptable terms, if at all. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

This
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). The preparation
of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we
evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to prepaid/accrued research and development expenses, stock-based compensation,
value of deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances, and fair value of the embedded derivative financial instrument related
to our convertible promissory notes. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions. 

93 

While
our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to the judgments and
estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 

Derivative
Instruments - We evaluated our convertible notes to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualified
as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 815, Derivatives
and Hedging . The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is marked to market each balance
sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded
in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss as other income or expense. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument,
the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity. 

In
circumstances where the embedded conversion option in a convertible instrument is required to be bifurcated and there are also other
embedded derivative instruments in the convertible instrument that are required to be bifurcated, the bifurcated derivative instruments
are accounted for as a single, compound derivative instrument. 

We
determined that the convertible notes contain embedded features that provide the noteholders with multiple settlement alternatives. Certain
of these settlement features provide the noteholders the right to receive cash or a variable number of shares upon the completion of
a capital raising transaction, change of control or default by us, which are referred to as redemption features. 

Stock-Based
Compensation - We measure all stock-based awards granted based on their estimated fair value on the date of the grant and recognize
the corresponding compensation expense for those awarded to employees and directors over the requisite service period, which is generally
the vesting period of the respective award, and for those awarded to nonemployees over the period during which services are rendered
by nonemployees until completed. We have typically issued stock options with service-based vesting conditions and we record the expense
for these awards using the straight-line method. 

We
estimate the fair value of each stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value
of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free
interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. 

The
following table reflects the weighted average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options granted during the years ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021: 

2022 
 2021 
 
 Volatility 
 117-124

 5.27-10.0 
 10.0 
 
 Risk-free interest rate 
 1.70-3.06 
 1.37-1.74 
 
 Dividend rate 

Before
establishing a public market for the trading of our common stock and due to a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility
data, we based the estimate of expected stock price volatility on the historical volatility of a representative group of publicly traded
companies for which historical information was available. The historical volatility was generally calculated based on a period of time
commensurate with the expected term assumption. We used the simplified method to calculate the expected term for options granted to employees
and directors. We did not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected
term and used the contractual term since the stock options were not issued at-the-money. For options granted to non-employees, we utilized
the contractual term. The risk-free interest rate was based on a U.S. treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected
term of the stock options. The expected dividend yield was assumed to be zero, as we had never paid dividends and do not have current
plans to pay any dividends on our common stock. 

94 

Fair
Value of Common Stock 

Prior
to establishing a public market for our common stock, the estimated fair value of our common stock had been determined by our board of
directors as of the date of each option grant, with input from management, considering our most recently available third-party valuations
of common stock, and our board of directors assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant
and which may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant. 

Third-party
valuations were performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Accounting
and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation . Our common stock valuations
were prepared using a hybrid method that incorporated elements of both a probability-weighted expected return method PWERM and an option pricing method OPM ). 

The
OPM is based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which allows for the identification of a range of possible future outcomes. The
OPM treats common stock and convertible instruments as call options on the total equity value of a company, with exercise prices based
on the value thresholds at which the allocation among the various holders of a company s securities changes. A discount for lack
of marketability of the common stock is applied to arrive at an indication of value for the common stock. 

PWERM
involves a forward-looking analysis of the possible future outcomes of the enterprise. This method is particularly useful when discrete
future outcomes can be predicted at a relatively high confidence level with a probability distribution. Discrete future outcomes considered
under the PWERM include an initial public offering, as well as non-initial public offering market-based outcomes. Determining the fair
value of the enterprise using the PWERM requires the Company to develop assumptions and estimates for both the probability of an initial
public offering liquidity event and stay private outcomes, as well as the values the Company expects those outcomes could yield. 

Prior
to establishing a public trading market of our capital stock, our board of directors exercised reasonable judgment and considered a number
of objective and subjective factors to determine its estimate of the fair value of our common stock, including changes in the following
factors between the date of the March 31, 2021 valuation and the grant date: 

our
 business, financial condition and results of operations, including related industry trends affecting our operations; 

the
 likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or sale of our company, given prevailing market conditions;

the
 lack of marketability of our common stock; 

the
 market performance of comparable publicly traded companies; and 

U.S.
 and global economic and capital market conditions and outlook. 

The
assumptions underlying our board of directors valuations represented our board s best estimates, which involved inherent
uncertainties and the application of our board s judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes had changed or our board
of directors had used significantly different assumptions or estimates, our equity-based compensation expense could have been materially
different. 

Research and Development Costs 

Research and
development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs consist primarily of clinical research fees paid to
consultants and outside service providers, other expenses relating to design, development and testing of our
therapy candidates, and for license and milestone costs related to in-licensed products and technology. Costs incurred in obtaining
technology licenses are charged to research and development expense if the technology licensed has not reached commercial
feasibility and has no alternative future use. Such licenses purchased by us require substantial completion of research
and development, regulatory and marketing approval efforts in order to reach commercial feasibility and has no alternative future
use. 

Clinical trial
costs are a component of research and development expenses. The Company estimates expenses incurred for clinical trials that are in
process based on services performed under contractual agreements with clinical research organizations and actual clinical
investigators. Included in the estimates are (1) the fee per patient enrolled as specified in the clinical trial contract with each
institution participating in the clinical trial and (2) progressive data on patient enrollments obtained from participating clinical
trial sites and the actual services performed. Changes in clinical trial assumptions, such as the length of time estimated to enroll
all patients, rate of screening failures, patient drop-out rates, number and nature of adverse event reports, and the total number
of patients enrolled can impact the average and expected cost per patient and the overall cost of the clinical trial. We
monitor the progress of the trials and their related activities and adjust expense accruals, when applicable. Adjustments to
accruals are charged to expense in the period in which the facts give rise to the adjustments become known.

Accounting Pronouncements 

See
Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent
accounting pronouncements applicable to our consolidated financial statements. 

JOBS
Act 

On
April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take
advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting
standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those
standards would otherwise apply to private companies. 

We
have chosen to take advantage of the extended transition periods available to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act for complying
with new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies provided under the JOBS Act.
As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates for
complying with new or revised accounting standards. 

Subject
to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company, we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions,
including, without limitation, (i) providing an auditor s attestation report on our internal controls over financial reporting
pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with the requirement adopted by the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board PCAOB regarding the communication of critical audit matters in the auditor s report on financial
statements. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which
we have total annual gross revenues of 1.235 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of
the date of the completion of our initial public offering; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in nonconvertible
debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the
SEC.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
Immix Biopharma, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Immix Biopharma, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company as
of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders equity and
cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated
financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

which, upon expiration, automatically renews for successive one-year periods unless terminated by the Company upon notice at least

votes that is equal to 1.1 times a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of (A) the shares of outstanding Nexcella common stock
and (B) the whole shares of Nexcella common stock into which the shares of outstanding Nexcella Class A Common Stock and the Class A
Preferred Stock are convertible and the denominator of which is number of shares of outstanding Nexcella Class A Preferred Stock. 

Each
share of Class A Common Stock is convertible, at the Company s option, into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Nexcella s
common stock, subject to certain adjustments. In addition, upon a Qualified IPO (as defined the Nexcella COI or Qualified Change in Control (as defined in the Nexcella
COI), the shares of Class A Common Stock, will automatically convert into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Nexcella s
common stock; provided however, if at that time, the Class A Common Stock is not then convertible into a number of shares of Nexcella
common stock (or such other capital stock or securities at the time issuable upon the conversion of the Class A Common Stock) that have

purchased equipment (to the extent not already encumbered) and (ii) any amounts received as a tax rebate or incentive during the term
of the 2016 Note. On December 20, 2021, the outstanding principal and accrued interest were converted into shares of the Company s

in connection with the Company s IPO (see below). 

In
March and April 2021, the Company issued a series of unsecured convertible promissory notes 2021A Notes in the aggregate
principal amount of to the Company s Chief Financial Officer and Alwaysraise LLC, an entity in which the Company s
Chief Financial Officer is the sole member. Of the principal amount, the Company received in cash proceeds and issued
a note in exchange for services. The 2021A Notes were scheduled to mature on , and bore interest at per annum.
In connection with the issuance of the 2021A Notes, the Company issued ten-year warrants to purchase shares of the Company s
common stock at an exercise price of per share. The warrants were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following inputs: an expected and contractual life of years, an assumed volatility of , a dividend rate, and a risk free
rate of . The relative fair value of the warrants amounting to was recorded to debt discount and was amortized to interest
expense through the date of the Company s IPO, at which time the outstanding principal and accrued interest was converted into
shares of the Company s common stock (see below). 

The
2016 Note, 2018 Note, 2019 Notes and 2021A Notes are collectively referred to as the Notes. In the event that the Company
issued and sold shares of its equity securities Equity Securities to investors (the Investors prior to
the maturity dates of the Notes in an equity financing with total proceeds to the Company of not less than (including the
conversion of the Notes, other indebtedness or other convertible securities issued for capital raising purposes (e.g., Simple Agreements
for Future Equity)) (a Qualified Financing ), then the outstanding principal amount of the Notes and any unpaid accrued
interest would automatically convert in whole without any further action by the holders into Equity Securities sold in the Qualified
Financing at a conversion price equal to the lesser of (i) the price paid per share for Equity Securities by the Investors in the Qualified
Financing multiplied by 0.80, and (ii) the quotient resulting from dividing by the number of pre-split outstanding shares
of the common stock of the Company immediately prior to the Qualified Financing (assuming conversion of all securities convertible into
common stock and exercise of all outstanding options and warrants, including all shares of common stock reserved and available for future
grant under any equity incentive or similar plan of the Company, and/or any equity incentive or similar plan created or increased in
connection with Qualified Financing, and including the shares of equity securities of the Company issued for capital raising purposes
(e.g., Simple Agreements for Future Equity)). The issuance of Equity Securities pursuant to the conversion of the Notes were subject
to the same terms and conditions applicable to Equity Securities sold in the Qualified Financing. 

Upon
the occurrence of a change of control prior to a Qualified Financing or maturity, the 2019 Notes and the 2021A Notes would upon the election
of the holders either (i) become due and payable upon closing of such change of control in cash in an amount equal to (a) the outstanding
principal amount plus any unpaid accrued interest, plus (b) a repayment premium equal to 200 of the outstanding principal amount, or
(ii) be converted such that the outstanding principal balance and any unpaid accrued interest would convert into shares of the Company s
common stock at a conversion price equal to the quotient resulting from dividing by the number of outstanding shares of common
stock of the Company immediately prior to the change of control (assuming conversion of all securities convertible into common stock
and exercise of all outstanding options and warrants, and including the shares of equity securities of the Company issuable upon the
conversion of notes, other indebtedness or other convertible securities issued for capital raising purposes). 

On
December 20, 2021, in connection with the Company s IPO, which was deemed a Qualified Financing, the Notes along with the corresponding
accrued interest, were automatically converted into an aggregate of shares of the Company s common stock. As a result
of the conversion, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of . 

The
Notes contained embedded derivative instruments, including automatic conversion into equity securities upon completion of a Qualified
Financing, that were required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately as a single derivative instrument initially and subsequently
measured at fair value with the change in fair value recorded in other income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive loss. The Company determined that the issuance date fair values of the derivative instruments for the 2016
Note, 2018 Note, and 2019 Notes, was nominal based on its assumptions of probabilities of a Qualified Financing or change of control
transaction. For the 2021A Notes issued during March and April 2021, the Company recorded the fair value of the derivative instruments
of , as a debt discount on the issuance dates which was amortized to interest expense through the date of the Company s
IPO, at which time the 2021A Notes were converted into shares of the Company s common stock. During the year ended December 31,
2021, the Company recognized expense of related to the change in fair value of the derivative instruments. Upon the conversion
of the Notes, the Company reclassified the estimated fair value of the derivative liability of to additional paid-in capital. 

Interest
expense related to the Notes was for the year ended December 31, 2021. Amortization of the debt discounts related to the 2021A
Notes was for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Fair
Value of Common Stock prior to establishing a public market 

Prior
to establishing a public market for the Company s common stock, the estimated fair value of the Company s common stock was
determined by the Company s Board of Directors as of the date of each option grant, with input from management, considering the
Company s most recently available third-party valuations of common stock, and the Board of Directors assessment of additional
objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation
through the date of the grant. 

Third-party
valuations were performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Accounting
and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation . The Company s common
stock valuations were prepared using a hybrid method that incorporated elements of both a probability-weighted expected return method PWERM and an option pricing method OPM ). 

The
OPM was based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which allows for the identification of a range of possible future outcomes.
The OPM treats common stock and convertible instruments as call options on the total equity value of a company, with exercise prices
based on the value thresholds at which the allocation among the various holders of a company s securities changes. A discount for
lack of marketability of the common stock was applied to arrive at an indication of value for the common stock. 

PWERM
involves a forward-looking analysis of the possible future outcomes of the enterprise. This method is particularly useful when discrete
future outcomes can be predicted at a relatively high confidence level with a probability distribution. Discrete future outcomes considered
under the PWERM included an initial public offering, as well as non-initial public offering market-based outcomes. Determining the fair
value of the enterprise using the PWERM required the Company to develop assumptions and estimates for both the probability of an initial
public offering liquidity event and stay private outcomes, as well as the values the Company expected those outcomes could yield. 

Prior
to establishing a public trading market of the Company s capital stock, the Company s Board of Directors exercised reasonable
judgment and considered a number of objective and subjective factors to determine its estimate of the fair value of the Company s
common stock, including changes in the following factors between the date of the valuation and the grant date: 

the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations, including related industry trends affecting the Company s
operations; 

the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or sale of the Company, given prevailing market conditions; 

the lack of marketability of the Company s common stock; 

the market performance of comparable publicly traded companies; and 

U.S. and global economic and capital market conditions and outlook. 

The
assumptions underlying the Company s Board of Directors valuations represented the Board s best estimates, which involved
inherent uncertainties and the application of the Board s judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes had changed or
the Company s Board of Directors had used significantly different assumptions or estimates, the Company s equity-based compensation
expense could have been materially different. Following the completion of our IPO, the Company s Board of Directors began determining
the fair value of the Company s common stock based on the quoted market prices of its common stock.

In

shares of common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Board of Directors amended the 2016 Plan to increase the
aggregate number of shares available for issuance under the 2016 Plan to

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. The term disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act
means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in
the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to a company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives
of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December
31, 2022, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and
 principal financial officer has concluded that, based
on such evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K ,
our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness described below. However,
our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has concluded that, notwithstanding the identified
material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, the financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly
present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity
with U.S. GAAP.

identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that exists as of December 31, 2022. A material weakness
is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We determined
that we had a material weakness because, due to our small size, and our limited number of personnel, we did not have in place an effective
internal control environment with formal processes and procedures, including journal entry processing and review, to allow for a detailed
review of accounting transactions that would identify errors in a timely manner. 

Notwithstanding
the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we have concluded that the consolidated financial statements
included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and
cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Management s
Plan to Remediate the Material Weakness 

With
the oversight of senior management, we implemented remediation steps in 2021 including addition of accounting consultants and continue
to evaluate and implement procedures that will strengthen our internal controls. We believe these measures will remediate the material
weakness identified and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. We are committed to continuing to improve our
internal control processes and will continue to diligently review our financial reporting controls and procedures. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and Auditor Attestation 

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include a report of management s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting
due to a transition period established by the rules of the SEC for new public companies. In addition, this Annual Report on Form 10-K
does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting as an attestation is not required pursuant to the exemption provided to issuers that are not large accelerated filers 
nor accelerated filers under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Applicable
Anti-Takeover Law 

Set
forth below is a summary of the provisions of the Company s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation
Law that could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company. The following description is only a summary,
and it is qualified by reference to the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation
Law (the DGCL ). 

Delaware
Law 

The
Company is governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly traded Delaware corporation
from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction
in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A business
combination includes mergers, asset sales or other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the stockholder. An interested stockholder
is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns (or within three years, did own) 15 or more of the corporation s
voting stock, subject to certain exceptions. The statute could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control
of the Company. 

Board
of Directors Vacancies 

The
Company s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws authorize only the Company s board of directors to fill vacant directorships.
In addition, the number of directors constituting the Company s board of directors may be set only by resolution of the majority
of the incumbent directors. 

Stockholder
Action; Special Meeting of Stockholders 

The
Company s Bylaws provide that the Company s stockholders may not take action by written consent. The Company s Bylaws
further provide that special meetings of the Company s stockholders may be called by a majority of the board of directors, the
President, or the Chairman of the board of directors. 

Advance
Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations 

The
Company s Bylaws provide that stockholders seeking to bring business before the Company s annual meeting of stockholders,
or to nominate candidates for election as directors at the Company s annual meeting of stockholders, must provide timely notice
of their intent in writing. To be timely, a stockholder s notice must be delivered to the Company s Secretary at its principal
executive offices not later than the close of business on the 90 th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 120 th
 day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year s annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event the date
of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, or if no annual meeting was held
in the preceding year, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120 th
 day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90 th day prior to such
annual meeting or the 10 th day following the day on which a public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made
by the Company. These provisions may preclude the Company s stockholders from bringing matters before the Company s annual
meeting of stockholders or from making nominations for directors at the Company s annual meeting of stockholders. 

Authorized
but Unissued Share 

The
Company s authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock are available for future issuance without stockholder
approval and may be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional capital, corporate
acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved Common Stock and Preferred Stock could
render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of the Company by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or
otherwise. 

Exclusive
Forum 

The
Company s Certificate of Incorporation provides that unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company,
(ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to the
Company or its stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Company, its directors, officers or employees arising pursuant
to any provision of the DGCL or the Company s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against
the Company, its directors, officers, employees or agents governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (i) through
(iv) above, any claim as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction
of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten
days following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery,
or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. 

Additionally,
the Company s Certificate of Incorporation provides that the foregoing provision shall not apply to suits brought to enforce any
liability or duty created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other federal
securities laws for which there is exclusive federal or concurrent federal and state jurisdiction. Any person or entity purchasing or
otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of the Company s capital stock are deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision.

The
Company s transfer agent and registrar is Pacific Stock Transfer, Inc. whose address is 6725 Via Austi Pkwy, Suite
300, Las Vegas, Nevada 89119.

Conversion Mechanics 

1.
 Conversion Price . The conversion price in effect on any Conversion Date shall be equal to two dollars 2.00) per share of Common
Stock, subject to adjustment as hereafter provided (the Conversion Price ). 

2.
 Adjustments to Conversion Price . 

(a)
If the outstanding shares of Common Stock at any time while the Note remains outstanding shall be subdivided or split into a greater
number of shares, or a dividend in Common Stock shall be paid in respect of Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect immediately
prior to such subdivision or split or at the record date of such dividend shall, simultaneously with the effectiveness of such subdivision
or split or immediately after the record date of such dividend (as the case may be) shall be proportionately decreased. If the outstanding
shares of Common Stock shall be combined or reverse split into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately
prior to such combination or reverse split shall, simultaneously with the effectiveness of such combination or reverse split, be proportionately
increased. 

(b)
Unless such conversion is waived by the Lender, (i) immediately prior to any reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock (other than a change covered by Section 2(a) of this Exhibit B , above or which solely affects the par value of
such shares of Common Stock), (ii) immediately prior to the Borrower entering into a transaction or series of transactions with a special
purpose acquisition company whereby any class of securities of the Borrower or of its successor or any affiliate of the Borrower or its
successor is publicly traded or listed on a securities exchange, securities market or quotation system (such transaction or series of
transactions, a SPAC Transaction ), (iii) immediately prior to any other merger or consolidation of the Borrower
with or into another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which the Borrower is the continuing corporation and which
does not result in any reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding shares of Common Stock), (iv) immediately prior to any sale
or conveyance to another corporation or entity of the property of the Borrower as an entirety or substantially as an entirety in connection
with which the Borrower is dissolved (clauses (i) to (iv), collectively, the Conversion Triggers ), or (v) such other
time as determined by the Lender in its sole discretion, the Lender shall receive upon the conversion hereof, for the same aggregate
Conversion Price payable hereunder immediately prior to such event, the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or property
(including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, reorganization, SPAC Transaction, merger or consolidation, or upon a dissolution
following any such sale or other transfer, by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Borrower obtainable upon conversion
of the Note immediately prior to such event. The provisions of this Section 2(b) shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications,
reorganizations, mergers or consolidations, sales or other transfers. 

3.
 Mechanics of Conversion . 

(a)
 Conversion Shares Issuable Upon a Conversion . Subject to the terms of the Note, the number of Conversion Shares issuable upon
a conversion hereunder shall be determined by the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Principal Amount plus any earned or accrued,
but unpaid interest thereon of the Note to be converted by (y) the Conversion Price. 

(b)
 Delivery of Certificate Upon Conversion . Not later than two (2) business days after each Conversion Date (the Share
Delivery Date ), the Borrower shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Lender a certificate or certificates representing
the Conversion Shares to which the Lender is entitled. If the Conversion Shares have been registered for resale under the federal securities
laws pursuant to a current and effective registration statement, or if the Conversion Shares may be resold pursuant to an exemption from
registration under the federal securities laws without current public information and without volume or manner of sale limitations, the
certificates for the Conversion Shares shall not bear a restrictive legend, and the Conversion Shares to which the Lender shall be entitled
may be delivered electronically through DTC or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions, unless the Borrower
or its transfer agent does not have an account with DTC and/or is not participating in the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program.
If the Conversion Shares are delivered by physical certificate, the Borrower shall issue and deliver such certificate or certificates,
registered in the name of the Lender or its designee, for the number of Conversion Shares to which the Lender shall be entitled, to the
address specified in the Notice of Conversion. If the conditions set forth in this paragraph for issuing the Conversion Shares without
a restrictive legend are not met, the physical certificate or book entry position evidencing the Conversion Shares shall bear the following
legend: 

THIS
SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR THE SECURITIES COMMISSION OF ANY STATE IN RELIANCE UPON
AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE SECURITIES ACT ), AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY
NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION
FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATE
SECURITIES LAWS AS EVIDENCED BY A LEGAL OPINION OF COUNSEL TO THE TRANSFEROR TO SUCH EFFECT, THE SUBSTANCE OF WHICH SHALL BE REASONABLY
ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMPANY. 

(c)
 Obligation Absolute . The Borrower s obligations to issue and deliver the Conversion Shares upon conversion of the Note in
accordance with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any action or inaction by the Lender to enforce the
same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any judgment against any person or any action to enforce
the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by the Lender or any other
person of any obligation to the Borrower or any violation or alleged violation of law by the Lender or any other person, and irrespective
of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Borrower to the Lender in connection with the issuance of
such Conversion Shares; provided , however, that such delivery shall not operate as a waiver by the Borrower of any such action
the Borrower may have against the Lender. In the event the Lender shall elect to convert any or all of the outstanding Principal Amount
of the Note, the Borrower may not refuse conversion based on any claim that the Lender or anyone associated or affiliated with the Lender
has been engaged in any violation of law, agreement or for any other reason, unless an injunction from a court, on notice to the Lender,
restraining and or enjoining conversion of all or part of the Note shall have been sought. If the injunction is not granted, the Borrower
shall promptly comply with all conversion obligations herein. 

(d)
 Fractional Shares . No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of the Note.
As to any fraction of a share which the Lender would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such conversion, the Borrower shall at its
election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Conversion
Price or round up to the next whole share.
