 Development of Columbia Care s Other Business Elements 
 2020 
 March 2020 Private Placement of Units 
 In March 2020, the Company completed the first tranche of a non-brokered private placement (the March 2020 Private Placement of units (the March 2020 Private Placement Units for gross proceeds of US 14,250,000. Each March 2020 Private Placement Unit was comprised of: (i) US 1,000 principal amount of 9.875 senior secured first-lien notes (the March 2020 Private Placement Notes ); and (ii) 113 common share purchase warrants (the March 2020 Private Placement Warrants of the Company.

 10 

warrant indenture (the March 2020 Warrant Indenture dated March 31, 2020 between the Company and Odyssey Trust Company, as warrant agent. 
 Launch of Virtual.Care Platform 
 In April 2020, the Company announced the launch of Virtual.Care (the Platform ), an online educational and informational tool for patients, designated caregivers, and adult use purchasers, in those states where adult use cannabis is legalized. The Platform is accessed via the Company s age-gated website and was initially launched in three states: California, Illinois and Massachusetts and has now expanded to five additional jurisdictions: Arizona, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Washington, D.C. 
 Prior to launching the Platform, the Company s compliance team and external counsel undertook a review of the applicable federal and state privacy, advertising and cannabis laws and launched the Platform in a manner to comply with those laws. The Company s Platform is not intended to be used in advertising activities but is intended to be used solely as a virtual educational tool, allowing users to understand the products that the Company offers. There are no sales of products completed over the Platform. 
 A user may pre-order products but to complete an order, the user must physically visit the applicable Columbia Care dispensary. This requirement furthers compliance since no orders will be completed for residents of jurisdictions where medical and/or recreational cannabis is illegal, as applicable. 
 
 In jurisdictions where medical cannabis is legal, upon arrival of the user, the dispensary staff person will verify the user s medical marijuana card, government-issued identification and confirm the user s allotment to ensure the user is not exceeding the state s allotment limits. Once all of the foregoing is verified, the user will pay for the product to complete the purchase. The Platform does not allow medical users to obtain online certifications and any such certifications must be obtained through the normal channels. 
 In jurisdictions where recreational use is legal, upon arrival at the Columbia Care dispensary, the dispensary staff will verify that the user is at least 21 years of age by verifying the user s government-issued identification. Once the identification is verified, the user will pay for the product to complete the transaction. If the user does not have valid identification, the user will not be able to purchase cannabis at the Company s dispensaries. This process also allows monitoring of sales to non-residents and only allow sales where the state regulatory schemes allow an out-of-state resident to purchase product if he or she is present in the legal jurisdiction.

Columbia Care s refined cultivation practices have experienced several iterations since its inception. Its cultivation expertise reflects years of operating experience and specialized input from agricultural, manufacturing, scientific and security experts. The Company has implemented the best practices employed at its nationwide locations in each new facility that it develops and expects to continue to improve and optimize its methods and infrastructure to ensure competitiveness and excellence. 
 Columbia Care s production platform is designed to cultivate and manufacture cannabinoid-based products that are used specifically for medical use or consumer wellness, and health and lifestyle products produced to assure consistency and quality. Columbia Care engages national engineering consultants to design bespoke systems that follow industry best practices in order to produce its products. Columbia Care does all of this to optimize product quality, minimize the risk of exposing patients and consumers to potentially harmful contaminants while maximizing the effectiveness and consistency of the approved products delivered. 
 Columbia Care believes that a clean and sanitized growing and processing environment is key to ensuring the integrity of products. These self-imposed disciplines are more resource intensive, but are designed to yield a safe, consistent, contaminant-free product that will lead the market in quality, safety and, where applicable, efficacy. 
 Columbia Care s growing process is designed to maximize quality, consistency and yield, while limiting contamination by fungal and bacterial diseases, insect and vertebrate pests, non-organic pesticides and other harmful contaminants. Each step in Columbia Care s cultivation process, including (i) germination/propagation; (ii) vegetation; (iii) bloom; and (iv) harvest is carefully executed using refined standard operating procedures and training protocols. Columbia Care has standardized nutrient protocols, growing environments, water and irrigation strategies, growing mediums, climate controls, plant tracking, and staffing programs among other components of its cultivation and manufacturing operations. Its ultimate goal is to maximize the biomass output (grams per square foot) across all Columbia Care-operated facilities at the lowest cost possible without sacrificing product quality. 
 Extraction 
 Columbia Care utilizes a number of well-established, regulatory-approved methods for cannabinoid extraction and performs extraction of the leaves, trimmings and flowers of female cannabis plants to produce an approved cannabinoid product form. Once extracted, Columbia Care s expert formulation staff formulates proprietary extracts into easily administered consumer products and medications for patient and consumer delivery by following protocol and state regulations. 
 Dispensaries 
 Columbia Care has, manages or is developing dispensaries in Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, Washington, D.C. and West Virginia. All of Columbia Care s dispensaries have either licensed pharmacists or trained personnel on staff to ensure that customers and patients have access to knowledgeable personnel that can advise on the responsible use of cannabis including delivery formats and dosing schedules.

Merchandising set-ups and store layouts are organized to help customers move through the space with intent and become more comfortable in the process. Additionally, retail spaces are designed to encourage employees and customers to engage in conversations that enhance the shopping experience, whether through product recommendations or general education. To fully realize this goal, Cannabist staff undergo extensive training. Beyond the in-store experience, technology serves as a bridge across the retail ecosystem that enables a seamless shopping experience. Cannabist locations will continue to leverage existing solutions, such as Virtual.Care, the personal shopping platform, and a proprietary web-based application called Forage to help customers on their product discovery journey. Several dispensary locations in Utah, Arizona, Illinois, California, Massachusetts, Florida and New York were transformed into Cannabist locations during 2021 and 2022. A number of new store openings in Virginia and West Virginia since 2021 are also Cannabist locations.

 The Company s products have similar characteristics due to the same raw material ingredient (cannabis), similar nature of cultivation process, the type or class of customer and the regulatory nature of our industry. Revenues from transactions with no single external customer exceed 10 of the consolidated revenues. Revenue earned outside of the United States of America is immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. Long-lived assets located outside of the United States of America are immaterial as at December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. 
 Columbia Care has begun to bring its family of branded products to all jurisdictions where it has manufacturing operations. Columbia Care s focus is to develop proprietary formulations and delivery technologies that provide patients and adult-use customers with high quality and differentiated products. 
 
 In 2016, Columbia Care announced the launch of its line of controlled-dose, solid-fill medicinal cannabinoid capsules. Formulated using the full range of active cannabinoid ingredients from plants grown in its cultivation facilities, these proprietary capsules offer a variety of concentrations in a more accessible and convenient delivery form to patients and customers. 
 Columbia Care introduced proprietary, controlled-dose, hard-pressed tablets in New York State. The tablets are manufactured by segregating and formulating precise combinations of active compounds derived from targeted strains of cannabis plants. From the formulation of these tablets, Columbia Care introduced additional products to provide a spectrum of cannabinoid profiles to address the continuum of patient and consumer needs. This precisely engineered diversity of optimized cannabinoids includes the Company s patent pending Ceed line of medicinal cannabis products, including TheraCeed tablets, EleCeed sublingual tinctures and ClaraCeed vaporization oil. 
 In 2020, the Company launched Seed Strain, its first lifestyle cannabis brand. Available in a number of markets, products include flower, pre-rolls and concentrates. Other product and branded categories include but are not limited to confections, chocolate, drink mixes, condiments, kief, shatter, and wax/crumble. Columbia Care launched Classix in five markets simultaneously in October 2021, and has since brought the brand to additional markets. Triple Seven has also been expanded from California to other operational markets. 
 Columbia Care intends to continue launching national brands across its medical and adult-use markets in order to maintain the consistency and quality of products that all patients and customers have come to expect from the Company. 
 None of Columbia Care s products have been shown to effectively treat or cure any disease. None of Columbia Care s products require approval by the FDA, and none of Columbia Care s products have been approved, reviewed or cleared by the FDA for any purpose. 
 Product Pricing 
 Columbia Care s prices vary based on market conditions and product pricing from non-cannabis suppliers. As a result of different tastes, preferences and customer demographics across its core markets, average dispensary sales differ significantly from state to state. 
 Caring for The Community We Serve 
 Having completed over 10 million sales transactions in multiple medicinal and adult-use cannabis markets since its inception, Columbia Care s team has accumulated significant experience in the treatment of large consumer and specialized patient populations, addressing a wide range of unique combination of qualifying conditions, symptoms and risks. Columbia Care has dedicated funding for research collaborations and initiatives with leading academic medical centers across the country to enhance patient care, inform the policy debate and empower healthcare and wellness professionals with data on best practices and safe and efficacious cannabinoid use. Through its public policy efforts, Columbia Care is also at the forefront of ensuring that social equity is a large part of legalization efforts across the United States. 
 Columbia Care has launched extensive patient care initiatives including utilizing anonymized patient data to facilitate product optimization and innovation on behalf of patient and consumer needs. Columbia Care s proprietary database is an important aspect of Columbia Care s product development as it invests in branded formulations and administration types that best respond to patient and consumer needs. 
 
 Columbia Care has distinguished itself by establishing research collaborations with renowned medical and research institutions globally. The collaborations are designed to improve product efficacy and assess the medical utility in its products while enhancing 
 19 

patient safety. Columbia Care has developed innovative and collaborative working relationships with a number of leading academic, patient advocacy, research and healthcare organizations as well as partnerships with private, academic, agricultural, policy, sustainability and economic programs at various institutions in the pursuit of expanding the body of scientific knowledge related to cannabis. This focus is one of the principal foundations of Columbia Care s corporate culture and has materially contributed to Columbia Care s position as one of the most qualified and experienced operators in certain regulated markets in the U.S. Some of the collaboration partners include but are not limited to researchers affiliated with the following institutions: Mount Sinai Hospital, Columbia University, Arizona State University, Brandeis University, The Center for Discovery in New York, The Dana Farber Cancer Institute, New York University, Albert Einstein/Montefiore Medical Center, Stanford University and King s College London. 
 Banking and Processing 
 Columbia Care deposits funds from its dispensary operations into bank accounts established with various banking partners. The Company ensures that the banks used are fully aware of the nature of the business and industry in which the Company operates. Columbia Care currently accepts cash, cashless ATMs, and in certain locations the CNC card. The CNC card is the first store credit card in the cannabis industry, providing Columbia Care customers an alternative payment method in participating markets, increasing access to the Company s products. Payment methods currently vary by market. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Columbia Care earned retail revenues of approximately 4.5 million and 4.5 million, respectively, from the CNC program. Columbia Care does not consider the CNC program to be a material revenue stream. 
 
 Real Estate Strategy 
 In each market that Columbia Care enters, it spends a significant amount of time and resources selecting real estate in highly desirable locations with convenient access to customers, healthcare communities and health and wellness providers and public transit, close proximity to major interstates and other traffic routes, ample parking, and the potential for significant foot traffic. Columbia Care typically targets retail spaces with a footprint of 2,500 to 7,500 square feet and cultivation/manufacturing facilities with a footprint of 20,000 to 65,000+ square feet, depending on the market and available real estate inventory. Columbia Care s practice is to secure leases with a base term of five to ten years with extension options for renewal terms of five years. 
 In-Store Pickup and Delivery 
 Columbia Care is currently associated with certain third-party platforms that offer pre-ordering for in-store pickup, online payment processing and home delivery services, where allowed by law. Where required, patients are offered educational material and/or consultations regarding route of administration and dosing format. 
 Inventory Management 
 In the jurisdictions where Columbia Care is operational, it has comprehensive inventory management practices that are compliant with applicable state laws and regulations. Such practices ensure control over Columbia Care s cannabis and cannabis product inventory using seed to sale tracking software. See Columbia Care Compliance Program Inventory and Security Policies . Columbia Care s practices are designed to avoid contamination and to ensure the safety and quality of the products dispensed. 
 Information Technology 
 Columbia Care strategically invests in information technology infrastructure. In fiscal year 2022, Columbia Care has initiated an effort to consolidate its operational systems, to provide national governance over business process and intelligence across merchandise planning, inventory management, production, costing, order management, accounting, reporting and analysis. These systems will provide the flexibility to support global and multi-channel expansion. Columbia Care has invested in information technology security platforms which are designed to protect patient and customer records and personal information in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
 Research and Development 
 Columbia Care has been tracking consented patient outcomes since 2013, and now has a research database of more than 20 million sales transactions across all sales locations. It is working with experts to analyze this anonymized data to devise new genetics and new products tailored to individual patient conditions and wellness states. 
 20 

Columbia Care has operated a product development and process development center in its Rochester, New York cultivation and manufacturing location since 2014, and now also conducts these activities in San Diego, California and Denver, Colorado. At these facilities, unit-dose formulations of proprietary cannabinoid combinations are created, and methods of extraction and separation are scaled. Additional work to add automation to these efforts and commercial manufacturing is ongoing. 
 Employees As of December 31, 2022, Columbia Care had 2,505 employees across its operating jurisdictions, versus 2,586 employees as of December 31, 2021. As of March 23, 2023, Columbia Care had approximately 2,278 employees. 
 Columbia Care is committed to: 
 Hiring, training and retaining an efficient, hard-working and qualified labor force that reflects the racial, cultural and ethnic composition of the communities it serves, including people of color, veterans, older workers and persons with physical and/or cognitive disabilities. 

Providing a work environment that is free of unlawful harassment, discrimination and retaliation: in furtherance of this commitment, Columbia Care strictly prohibits all forms of unlawful discrimination and harassment. 

Complying with all laws protecting qualified individuals with disabilities, as well as employees , independent contractors , vendors , unpaid interns and volunteers religious beliefs and observances. 

Columbia Care is committed to all of the above without regard to race, ethnicity, religion, color, sex, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, uniform service member and veteran status, marital status, pregnancy, age, protected medical condition, genetic information, disability, or any other protected status in accordance with all applicable federal, state, provincial and local laws. 
 Columbia Care employees are highly talented individuals who have educational achievements ranging from doctorates to masters to undergraduate degrees in a wide range of disciplines, as well as staff who have been trained on the job to uphold the highest standards as set by Columbia Care. It is currently a requirement that all of Columbia Care s employees pass background checks. 
 In addition, the safety of Columbia Care s employees is a priority and Columbia Care is committed to the prevention of illness and injury through the provision and maintenance of a healthy workplace. Columbia Care takes all reasonable steps to ensure staff are appropriately informed and trained to ensure the safety of themselves as well as others around them. 
 
 Columbia Care strives to provide an equal opportunity for all its employees to pursue career advancement and to consistently look within its organization for potential job candidates prior to posting employment offerings externally. Importantly, it does not embrace these policies solely out of altruism or an obligation under state requirements, but because it has learned from experience that the organization thrives and becomes more productive by maintaining a culture of inclusion where everyone feels valued and their individual contributions are appreciated and rewarded. 
 Competition 
 Columbia Care competes with other retail, manufacturing and cultivation license holders across the states in which it operates, as well as additional states. Many of Columbia Care s competitors are smaller, local operators, as well as an increasing number of operators with a significant presence in multiple states that compete directly with Columbia Care for regional market share. In certain markets, a number of dispensaries and cultivators operate illegally and compete directly with Columbia Care. However, Columbia Care expects that law enforcement will increasingly respond to illicit market operators. In addition to physical dispensaries, Columbia Care also competes with third-party delivery services, which provide direct-to-consumer delivery services. 
 Further, as more U.S. jurisdictions pass legislation allowing adult-use of cannabis, Columbia Care expects an increased level of competition in the U.S. market. A number of publicly-traded companies are expanding operations to states that have decriminalized cannabis consumption. The increasingly competitive U.S. state markets may adversely affect the financial condition and operations of Columbia Care. 
 See United States Regulatory Environment for additional details as to the regulatory environment in which Columbia Care operates. See Item 1A Risk Factors with respect to competition.

Intellectual Property 
 Columbia Care pursues patent and trademark protection around the world directed to its product and product candidates in an effort to establish intellectual property positions regarding cannabinoid products and devices. Patent prosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or foreign equivalents is often significantly narrowed by the time they are issued, if issued at all. Columbia Care expects this may be the case with respect to its pending patent applications referenced below. Columbia Care s intellectual property strategy seeks to provide protection for its product and product candidates, through the prosecution of different types of patent and trademark applications in the U.S. and worldwide. 
 Columbia Care s patent portfolio covers a number of its products and product candidates. As of March 3, 2023, this portfolio included 1 issued U.S. patent and at least 12 pending patent applications owned by Columbia Care, filed in one or more of three jurisdictions, including Canada and the U.S., which have strong patent systems. The issued U.S. patent is projected to expire in 2037. The patent applications, if granted, are projected to expire between 2037 and 2040, excluding any extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. 
 Our patent portfolio includes: 
 6 pending patent applications, filed in the US and Canada, that protect our EleCeed line of products, including claims directed to compositions, methods of their manufacture, methods of their use, and devices comprising the compositions; 

These patent applications, if granted, are projected to expire between 2037 and 2040, excluding any extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. 

11 pending patent applications, filed in the US and Canada, that protect our TheraCeed line of products, including claims directed to compositions, methods of their manufacture, methods of their use, kits for their use, devices comprising the compositions, and cartridges for use in devices; 

These patent applications, if granted, are projected to expire between 2037 and 2040, excluding any extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. 

6 pending patent applications, filed in the US and Canada, that protect our ClaraCeed line of products, including claims directed to compositions, methods of their manufacture, methods of their use and administration, kits for their administration, and cartridges for use in devices; 

These patent applications, if granted, are projected to expire in 2039, excluding any extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. 

and 1 patent application, filed in the US, that protect our Seed Strain DabTabs, including claims to compositions and methods of their use. 

These applications, if granted, are projected to expire in 2040, excluding any extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. 

While the USPTO has granted many patents for cannabis-related technologies, none have yet been successfully enforced in court. Until U.S. courts definitively address the enforceability of cannabis-related patents, or cannabis products are legalized federally in the U.S., we cannot be certain that any of our patents can be effectively enforced against our competitors, even if their products infringe our patents, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The USPTO may deny federal trademark registration if the trademark application covers goods or services that violate federal law, including cannabis products. However, certain hemp-derived goods, including hemp-derived CBD products with a THC concentration of not more than 0.3 on a dry weight basis, as well as ancillary products or services, are considered lawful under federal law and may be eligible for federal trademark registration. Additionally, the USPTO may accept trademark applications for consulting services or goods that do not directly involve the cannabis flower, such as computer software, educational platforms, and brand apparel. Trademarks covering these lawful goods and services are generally enforceable in federal court. Cannabis goods and services that do not meet the USPTO standard for trademark registration may qualify for state trademark registration in states where such goods and services have been legalized, and are generally enforceable in state courts in those states. No guarantee can be given that Columbia Care will be able to successfully assert its trademark rights, nor can the company guarantee that its trademark registrations will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Any such invalidity, particularly with respect to a product name, or a successful intellectual property challenge or infringement proceeding against the company, could have a material 
 22 

adverse effect on Columbia Care s business. In addition to patents and trademarks, Columbia Care relies upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain its competitive position. Columbia Care has developed numerous proprietary technologies and processes. While actively exploring the patentability of these techniques and processes, Columbia Care relies on non- disclosure/confidentiality arrangements and trade secret protection. Columbia Care seeks to protect its proprietary information, in part, by executing confidentiality agreements with third parties, its collaborators, and scientific advisors, and as well as non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements with its employees and consultants. The confidentiality agreements it enters into are designed to protect its proprietary information and the agreements or clauses requiring assignment of inventions to the Company are designed to grant it ownership of technologies that are developed through its relationship with the respective counterparty. Columbia Care cannot guarantee, however, that these agreements will afford it adequate protection of its intellectual property and proprietary information rights. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. In particular, some of Columbia Care s trade secrets and know-how for which it decides to not pursue additional patent protection may, over time, be disseminated within the industry through independent development and public presentations describing the methodology. 
 UNITED STATES REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT 
 Federal Regulatory Environment 
 
 Under U.S. federal law, marijuana is currently classified as a Schedule I drug. The Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 811) (the CSA classifies drugs in five different schedules. As a Schedule I drug, the federal Drug Enforcement Agency DEA considers marijuana to have a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision. In October of 2022, President Joseph R. Biden announced that marijuana scheduling under federal law would be reviewed, directing federal agencies, including the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services to review the scheduling status of marijuana under the CSA. In his announcement, the president noted that marijuana is scheduled as more dangerous than fentanyl which has contributed to a nationwide epidemic of overdose deaths. Following the passage of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (popularly known as the 2018 Farm Bill ), cannabis with a tetrahydrocannabinol THC content below 0.3 dry weight volume is classified as hemp and has been removed from the CSA. Hemp and products derived from it lawfully cultivated or manufactured in accordance with the 2018 Farm Bill, U.S. Department of Agriculture regulations and applicable state laws may now be sold into commerce and transported across state lines. The 2018 Farm Bill explicitly preserves the authority of the FDA to regulate certain products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds such as CBD under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act FD C Act and Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. In conjunction with the enactment of the 2018 Farm Bill, the FDA released a statement about the regulatory status of CBD, noting the FDA s position that it is unlawful to introduce food containing added CBD into interstate commerce, or to market CBD products as, or in, dietary supplements, regardless of whether the substances are hemp-derived. In January of 2023, the FDA issued a statement in connection with its denial of three citizen petitions requesting that the agency engage in rulemaking to establish regulations under which CBD derived from hemp could be legally marketed as a dietary ingredient in foods and dietary supplements. FDA stated that it is seeking assistance from Congress to create a new regulatory pathway that is better designed to regulate products that contain hemp derived cannabanoids, including CBD. In the interim, FDA stated that products (including dietary supplements, conventional foods, and animal foods) on the market are at risk of FDA enforcement as the agency deems appropriate. To date, the FDA s enforcement actions against companies manufacturing CBD products has primarily been limited to the issuance of warning letters to companies whose products have made prohibited, misleading, and unapproved drug claims. Various states have also enacted state-specific laws pertaining to the handling, manufacturing, labeling, and sale of CBD and other hemp consumable products. While some states explicitly authorize and regulate the production and sale of hemp-derived CBD consumable products or otherwise provide legal protection for authorized individuals to engage in such activities, other states restrict the sale of CBD products or prohibit such products outright. 
 
 Under federal law, cannabis having a concentration of THC greater than 0.3 by dry weight volume is marijuana. The scheduling of marijuana as a Schedule I drug is inconsistent with what Columbia Care believes to be many valuable medical uses for marijuana accepted by physicians, researchers, patients, and others. As evidence of this, the FDA on June 25, 2018 approved Epidiolex (CBD) oral solution for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, in patients two years of age and older. This is the first FDA-approved drug that contains a purified drug substance derived from marijuana. In this case, the substance is cannabidiol, or CBD, a cannabinoid found in both hemp and marijuana, which does not contain the intoxication properties of THC, the primary psychoactive component of marijuana. Columbia Care believes the CSA categorization as a Schedule I drug is not reflective of the medicinal properties of marijuana or the public perception thereof, and 
 23 

numerous studies show cannabis is not able to be abused in the same way as other Schedule I drugs, has medicinal properties, and can be safely administered. Moreover, while certain published studies show that marijuana may be less harmful than alcohol, alcohol is not classified under the CSA. This disparity may reflect the comparative stigma associated with marijuana that factors into scheduling decisions by the DEA. 
 
 The federal position is also not necessarily consistent with democratic approval of marijuana at the state government level in the United States. As of December 31, 2022, 37 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands have passed laws broadly legalizing marijuana for medicinal use by eligible patients. In the District of Columbia, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam and 21 of these states Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington marijuana is legal for adult-use regardless of medical condition, although not all of those jurisdictions have fully implemented their legalization programs. As more and more states legalized medical and/or adult-use marijuana, the federal government attempted to provide clarity on the incongruity between federal prohibition under the CSA and these state-legal regulatory frameworks. Until 2018, the federal government provided guidance to federal law enforcement agencies and banking institutions through a series of United States Department of Justice DOJ memoranda. One significant memorandum was drafted by former Deputy Attorney General James Cole in 2013 (the Cole Memo ). 
 
 The Cole Memo offered guidance to federal enforcement agencies as to how to prioritize civil enforcement, criminal investigations and prosecutions regarding marijuana in all states. The Cole Memo put forth eight prosecution priorities: 
 1. Preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors; 

2. Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels; 

3. Preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states; 

4. Preventing the state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; 

5. Preventing the violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana; 

6. Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use; 

7. Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands; and 

8. Preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property. 

On January 4, 2018, former United States Attorney General Jefferson Sessions rescinded the Cole Memo by issuing a new memorandum to all United States Attorneys (the Sessions Memo ). Rather than establish national enforcement priorities particular to marijuana-related crimes in jurisdictions where certain marijuana activity was legal under state law, the Sessions Memo instructs that [i]n deciding which marijuana activities to prosecute... with the DOJ s finite resources, prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions. Namely, these include the seriousness of the offense, history of criminal activity, deterrent effect of prosecution, the interests of victims, and other principles. 
 
 The former Attorneys General who succeeded former Attorney General Sessions following his resignation did not provide a clear policy directive for the United States as it pertains to state-legal marijuana-related activities. It is still not yet known whether the Department of Justice under President Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland will re-adopt the Cole Memo or announce a substantive marijuana enforcement policy. Justice Garland stated at a confirmation hearing in 2021 before the United States Senate that It does not seem to me a useful use of limited resources that we have, to be pursuing prosecutions in states that have legalized and that are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise. I don t think that s a useful use. [1] Recently, in testimony in February of 2023 before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Garland said the DOJ is still working on a marijuana policy and that policy when issued will be very close to what was done in the Cole Memorandum. [2] 
 [1] John Schroyer, (2021 February 22) Attorney general nominee Garland signals friendlier marijuana stance, available at https://mjbizdaily.com/attorney-general-nominee-merrick-garland-signals-friendlier-marijuana-stance/ 
 
 [2] Ben Adlin, (March 1, 2023) Biden s Attorney General says DOJ is still working on federal marijuana policy approach. https://www.marijuanamoment.net/bidens-attorney-general-says-doj-is-still-working-on-federal-marijuana-policy-approach/ 
 
 Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of marijuana will not be repealed or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. 
 24 

Unless and until the United States Congress amends the CSA with respect to marijuana (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law. Currently, in the absence of uniform federal guidance, as had been established by the Cole Memo, enforcement priorities are determined by respective United States Attorneys, and notwithstanding public statements to the contrary, federal law enforcement could enforce the CSA and its criminal prohibition on commercial cannabis activity -- vigorously. 
 Due to the CSA categorization of marijuana as a Schedule I drug, federal law also makes it illegal for financial institutions that depend on the Federal Reserve s money transfer system to take any proceeds from marijuana sales as deposits. Banks and other financial institutions could be prosecuted and possibly convicted of money laundering for providing services to cannabis businesses under the United States Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (the Bank Secrecy Act ). Therefore, under the Bank Secrecy Act, banks or other financial institutions that provide a cannabis business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan, or any other service could be charged with money laundering or conspiracy. 
 While there has been no change in U.S. federal banking laws to accommodate businesses in the large and increasing number of U.S. states that have legalized medical and/or adult-use marijuana, the Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network FinCEN ), in 2014, issued guidance to prosecutors of money laundering and other financial crimes (the FinCEN Guidance ). The FinCEN Guidance advised prosecutors not to focus their enforcement efforts on banks and other financial institutions that serve marijuana-related businesses so long as that business is legal in their state and none of the federal enforcement priorities referenced in the Cole Memo are being violated (such as keeping marijuana away from children and out of the hands of organized crime). The FinCEN Guidance also clarifies how financial institutions can provide services to marijuana-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act obligations, including thorough customer due diligence, but makes it clear that they are doing so at their own risk. The customer due diligence steps include: 
 1. Verifying with the appropriate state authorities whether the business is duly licensed and registered; 

2. Reviewing the license application (and related documentation) submitted by the business for obtaining a state license to operate its marijuana-related business; 

3. Requesting from state licensing and enforcement authorities available information about the business and related parties; 

4. Developing an understanding of the normal and expected activity for the business, including the types of products to be sold and the type of customers to be served (e.g., medical versus adult-use customers); 

5. Ongoing monitoring of publicly available sources for adverse information about the business and related parties; 

6. Ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity, including for any of the red flags described in this guidance; and 

7. Refreshing information obtained as part of customer due diligence on a periodic basis and commensurate with the risk. 

With respect to information regarding state licensure obtained in connection with such customer due diligence, a financial institution may reasonably rely on the accuracy of information provided by state licensing authorities, where states make such information available. 
 
 Because most banks and other financial institutions are unwilling to provide any banking or financial services to marijuana businesses, these businesses can be forced into becoming cash-only businesses. While the FinCEN Guidance decreased some risk for banks and financial institutions considering serving the industry, in practice it has not substantially increased banks willingness to provide services to marijuana businesses. This is because, as described above, the current law does not guarantee banks immunity from prosecution, and it also requires banks and other financial institutions to undertake time-consuming and costly due diligence on each marijuana business they accept as a customer. 
 
 Those state-chartered banks and credit unions that do have customers in the marijuana industry charge marijuana businesses high fees to pass on the added cost of ensuring compliance with the FinCEN Guidance. 
 Unlike the Cole Memo, however, the FinCEN Guidance from 2014 has not been rescinded. 
 Despite the rescission of the Cole Memo in 2018, Columbia Care continues to do the following towards ensuring compliance with the guidance provided by the Cole Memo, the FinCEN Guidance, and other best industry practices: 
 Columbia Care and its subsidiaries operate in compliance with licensing requirements that are set forth with regards to cannabis operation by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough, and other political/administrative divisions. 
 25 

Columbia Care s cannabis-related activities adhere to the scope of the licensing obtained for example, in the states where only medical cannabis is permitted, products are sold only to patients who hold the necessary documentation to permit the possession of the cannabis. 
 Columbia Care performs due diligence on contractors or anyone provided access to secure areas of its facilities to prevent cannabis products from being distributed to minors. 
 Columbia Care works to ensure that the licensed operators have an adequate inventory tracking system and adequate procedures in place so that their compliance system can track inventory effectively. This is done so that there is no diversion of cannabis or cannabis products into states where cannabis is not permitted by state law, or across state lines in general. 
 Columbia Care conducts background checks as required by applicable state law. 
 Columbia Care conducts reviews of activities of the cannabis businesses, the premises on which they operate, and the policies and procedures that are related to possession of cannabis or cannabis products outside of its licensed premises (including the cases where such possession is permitted by regulation e.g., transfer of products between licensed premises). These reviews are completed to ensure that licensed operators do not possess or use cannabis on federal property or engage in manufacturing or cultivation of cannabis on federal lands. 
 Columbia Care s product packaging complies with applicable regulations and contains necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products to prevent adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and prevent impaired driving. 
 Moreover, certain temporary federal legislative enactments that protect the medical marijuana industries have also been in effect for several years. For instance, certain marijuana businesses receive a measure of protection from federal prosecution by operation of temporary appropriations measures that have been enacted into law as amendments (or riders to federal spending bills passed by Congress and signed by the past three presidents. For instance, in the Appropriations Act of 2015, Congress included a budget rider that prohibits DOJ from expending any funds to enforce any law that interferes with a state s implementation of its own medical marijuana laws. The rider is known as the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment after its original lead sponsors. 
 The Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment was renewed most recently in the Consolidated Appropriations Acts of 2023, which funds the agencies of the federal government through September 30, 2023. Notably, the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment has applied only to medical marijuana programs and has not provided the same protections to enforcement against adult-use activities. While the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment has been included in successive appropriations legislation or resolutions since 2015, its inclusion or non-inclusion is subject to political change. 
 There is a growing consensus among marijuana businesses and numerous congressmen and congresswomen that guidance and temporary legislation are an inappropriate way to protect cannabis businesses. Numerous bills have been introduced in Congress in recent years to decriminalize aspects of state-legal marijuana trades. This has led to a bipartisan Congressional Marijuana Working Group in Congress. In December 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate passed, and President Biden signed into law, the Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act, which provides for significantly broader opportunities to study cannabis. Other important measures have received successful votes in congressional committees or passage in the U.S. House of Representatives. For instance, the SAFE Banking Act, which had more than 200 cosponsors and would prevent federal banking regulators from taking adverse actions against financial institutions solely due to an institution s provision of financial services to state-legal marijuana businesses, passed the U.S. House of Representatives with strong bipartisan support in 2019 and 2021, and again passed the House as an amendment to the America COMPETES Act in 2022. However, the SAFE Banking Act has failed to pass the U.S. Senate. 
 An additional challenge to marijuana-related businesses is that the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, Section 280E Section 280E ), are being applied by the IRS to businesses operating in the medical and adult-use marijuana industry. Section 280E prohibits marijuana businesses from deducting ordinary and necessary business expenses, forcing them to pay higher effective federal tax rates than similar companies in other industries. As a result of Section 280E, the Company s effective tax rate can be highly variable and depends on how large its ratio of non-deductible expenses is to its total revenues. Therefore, businesses in the legal cannabis industry may be less profitable than they would otherwise be. 
 State Regulatory Environment 
 The following sections describe the legal and regulatory landscape in the states in which Columbia Care operates. While Columbia Care works to ensure that its operations comply with applicable state laws, regulations, and licensing requirements, for the reasons described above and the risks further described under the heading Risk Factors , there are significant risks associated with the

 Arizona Regulatory Landscape 
 In 2010, Arizona passed Ballot Proposition 203, which amended Title 36 to the Arizona Revised Statutes. This amendment added Chapter 28.1, titled the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act (the AMMA ). The AMMA is codified in Arizona Revised Statutes 36-2801 et. seq . The AMMA also appointed the Arizona Department of Health Services ADHS as the regulator for the program and authorized ADHS to promulgate, adopt and enforce regulations for the AMMA. These ADHS regulations are embodied in the Arizona Administrative Code Title 9 Chapter 17 (the Medical Rules ). ARS 36-2801(12) defines a nonprofit medical marijuana dispensary as a not-for-profit entity that acquires, possesses, cultivates, manufactures, delivers, transfers, transports, supplies, sells or dispenses marijuana or related supplies and educational materials to cardholders. 
 The ADHS has established the medical marijuana program, which includes a vertically integrated license, meaning if allocated a Medical Marijuana Dispensary Registration Certificate (a Certificate ), entities are authorized to dispense and cultivate medical cannabis. Each Certificate allows the holding entity to operate one on-site cultivation facility, and one off-site cultivation facility which can be located anywhere within the State of Arizona. An entity holding a Certificate is required to file an application to renew with the ADHS on a biannual basis, which must also include audited annual financial statements. 
 
 To qualify to use medical marijuana under the AMMA, a patient is required to have a debilitating medical condition. Valid medical conditions include but may not be limited to HIV, cancer, glaucoma, immune deficiency syndrome, Hepatitis C, Crohn s disease, agitation of Alzheimer s disease, ALS, cachexia/wasting syndrome, muscle spasms, nausea, seizures, severe and chronic pain or another chronic or debilitating condition. 
 Arizona S.B. 1494 went into effect in August 2019. The bill authorized the ADHS to adopt rules for inspecting medical marijuana dispensaries and created an independent testing regime for marijuana cultivated by a medical marijuana dispensary. Beginning in November 2020, before marijuana is sold, it must be tested for unsafe levels of microbial contamination, heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, growth regulators and residual solvents. 
 S.B. 1494 also authorized civil penalties of up to 1,000 per violation (not to exceed 5,000 in a 30-day period) on medical marijuana dispensaries. Regulations implementing S.B. 1494 went into effect on August 27, 2019. The Department promulgated amendments to the medical marijuana regulations, which became effective September 8, 2022. Changes include, among other things, a new process to apply for changes to registrations, such as changes of location and additional laboratory testing requirements. 
 In 2020, Arizona passed Ballot Proposition 207, which amended Title 36 to the Arizona Revised Statutes. This amendment added Chapter 28.2, titled the Smart and Safe Arizona Act (the SSAA ). The SSAA is codified in Arizona Revised Statutes 36-2850 et. seq. The SSAA appointed ADHS as the regulator for the program and required ADHS to promulgate, adopt, and enforce regulations for the SSAA. ADHS first published rules to administer the Adult- use Marijuana Program in the Arizona Administrative Code Title 9 Chapter 18 (the Adult-use Rules; together with the Medical Rules, the Rules ). These Adult-use Rules became effective on January 15, 2021. ADHS promulgated additional amendments to the Adult-use Rules effective September 8, 2022, which make changes, among others, to the requirements for marijuana establishments preparing food or beverages and additional laboratory testing requirements. ARS 36-2850 defines marijuana establishment as an entity licensed by the department to operate all of the following: a single retail location at which the licensee may sell marijuana and marijuana products to consumers, cultivate marijuana and manufacture marijuana products; a single off-site cultivation location at which the licensee may cultivate marijuana, process marijuana and manufacture marijuana products, but from which marijuana and marijuana products may not be transferred or sold to consumers; and a single off-site cultivation location at which the licensee may cultivate marijuana, process marijuana and manufacture marijuana products, but from which marijuana and marijuana products may not be transferred or sold to consumers. 
 Columbia Care (through its subsidiaries in the State of Arizona) follows applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Arizona.

Arizona Medical Marijuana Licensing Requirements 
 In order for an applicant to receive a Certificate, it must: (i) fill out an application on the form prescribed by ADHS, (ii) submit the applicant s articles of incorporation and by-laws, (iii) submit fingerprints for each principal officer or board member of the applicant for a background check to exclude felonies, (iv) submit a business plan and policies and procedures for inventory control, security, patient education, and patient recordkeeping that are consistent with the AMMA and the Medical Rules to ensure that the dispensary will operate in compliance, and (v) designate an Arizona licensed physician as the Medical Director for the dispensary. Certificates are renewed biannually so long as the dispensary is in good standing with ADHS, pays the renewal fee, and submits an independent third-party financial audit. 
 Once an applicant has been issued a Certificate, they are allowed to establish one physical retail dispensary location, one cultivation location which is co-located at the dispensary s retail site (if allowed by local zoning) and one additional off-site cultivation location. None of these sites can be operational, however, until the dispensary receives an approval to operate from ADHS for the applicable site. This approval to operate requires: (i) an application on the ADHS form, (ii) demonstration of compliance with local zoning regulations, (iii) a site plan and floor plan for the applicable property, and (iv) an in-person inspection by ADHS of the applicable location to ensure compliance with the Medical Rules and consistency with the dispensary s applicable policies and procedures. 
 Arizona Adult-use Marijuana Licensing Requirements 
 In order for an applicant to receive a marijuana facility agent license, it must submit to ADHS (i) the personal identification information prescribed by ADHS including a background check and fingerprints and (ii) the applicable fee as prescribed in the Adult-use Rules. The license must be renewed every two years. A licensee may seek renewal by submitting to ADHS, at least thirty calendar days before the license expiration, (a) information on the license, (b) updated personal information including a criminal records check, and (c) the applicable fee as prescribed in the Adult- use Rules. 
 ADHS may issue one marijuana establishment license for every 10 pharmacies registered under 32-1929 and no more than two licenses per county that contains no registered medical marijuana dispensaries, or one license per county that contains one registered medical marijuana dispensary. In the event that more complete and compliant applications are received than ADHS may issue, ADHS will issue the licenses according to criteria prescribed in the Adult-use Rules. The initial round of license applications were due March 9, 2021. 
 In order for an application to be considered complete and compliant such that an applicant may be considered for a marijuana establishment license, the applicant must (i) pay the appropriate non-refundable fee prescribed by ADHS, (ii) submit the ADHS-prescribed application, (iii) documentation of: facility agent licenses for principal officers and board members, good standing with the Arizona Corporation Commission, zoning compliance, ownership of or permission to use the physical address, and sufficient funds. 
 Applicants that have a Certificate issued under the Medical Rules, the applicant may apply for a marijuana establishment license by submitting (i) an attestation from each principal officer and board member approving the application, (ii) the license number on the applicant s dispensary registration certificate, (iii) whether the applicant wants to transfer the cultivation site under the registration certificate to the marijuana license, and (iv) the applicable fee. 
 A holder of a marijuana establishment license may apply for approval to operate a marijuana establishment by submitting, within 18 months after the marijuana establishment license was issued, the following: (i) an application on the form prescribed by ADHS, (ii) documentation of local permission to use the property as a marijuana establishment (such as a certificate of occupancy, special use permit, or a conditional use permit), (iii) a list of activities the establishment is requesting, including cultivation, manufacturing, or preparation of edible products, (iv) a license of the location as a food establishment if preparing edible products, (v) a site plan, and (vi) a floor plan. 
 Marijuana establishments that received their license through the process for applicants with Certificates may begin operating without submitting the above if the entity holding the license (i) received approval to operate under the Medical Rules and (ii) is operating and available to dispense medical marijuana in accordance with the Medical Rules. 
 Marijuana establishment licenses must be renewed every two years.

ADHS Inspections and Enforcement 
 ADHS may inspect a medical facility at any time upon five (5) days notice to the dispensary. However, if someone has alleged that the dispensary is not in compliance with the AMMA or the Medical Rules, ADHS may conduct an unannounced inspection.

 CALIFORNIA 
 California Regulatory Landscape 
 In 1996, California was the first state to legalize medical marijuana through Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996. This legalized the use, possession and cultivation of medical marijuana by patients with a physician recommendation for treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or any other illness for which marijuana provides relief. 
 In 2003, Senate Bill 420 was signed into law establishing an optional identification card system for medical marijuana patients. 
 In September 2015, the California legislature passed three bills collectively known as the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act MCRSA ). The MCRSA established a licensing and regulatory framework for medical marijuana businesses in California. The system created multiple license types for dispensaries, infused products manufacturers, cultivation facilities, testing laboratories, transportation companies, and distributors. Edible infused product manufacturers would require either volatile solvent or non-volatile solvent manufacturing licenses depending on their specific extraction methodology. Multiple agencies would oversee different aspects of the program and businesses would require a state license and local approval to operate. However, in November 2016, voters in California overwhelmingly passed Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act AUMA creating an adult-use marijuana program for adults 21 years of age or older. AUMA had some conflicting provisions with MCRSA, so in June 2017, the California State Legislature passed Senate Bill No. 94, known as Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act MAUCRSA ), which amalgamates MCRSA and AUMA to provide a set of regulations to govern a medical and adult-use licensing regime for cannabis businesses in the State of California. The four agencies that originally regulated marijuana at the state level were the Bureau of Cannabis Control BCC ), California Department of Food and Agriculture DFA ), California Department of Public Health DPH ), and California Department of Tax and Fee Administration. MAUCRSA went into effect on January 1, 2018. 
 On July 1, 2019, California enacted A.B. 97. In relevant part, the bill authorizes licensing authorities to issue citations and fines to a licensee or an unlicensed person who violates MAUCRSA. The maximum fine is 5,000 per violation for licensees and 30,000 per violation for unlicensed persons. Each day of a violation constitutes a separate violation. 
 A.B. 97 also repeals a prior requirement that an applicant for a provisional license first hold a temporary license. The bill also requires applicants for provisional licenses to submit evidence of compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act, limits the validity of a provisional license to 12 months with subsequent renewals as approved by the relevant licensing authority, and allows licensing authorities to revoke provisional licenses for failing to diligently pursue final licensure. Finally, the bill requires the DPH to establish a 
 31 

certification program for manufactured cannabis products comparable to the National Organic Program and the California Organic Food and Farming Act. 
 On October 12, 2019, California enacted A.B. 1529. The bill mandates that all cannabis vaping cartridges and cannabis vaporizers must include a universal symbol identifying the product as a vaping product. 
 On July 12, 2021, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law Assembly Bill 141 (AB-141), which creates the Department of Cannabis Control DCC ). The DCC will consolidate the state s cannabis program oversight from three of the existing agencies the BCC, the DFA, and the DPH under a single department in an effort to centralize and simplify regulatory and licensing oversight in California. DCC similarly announced its intention to create a single Licensing Division that would be responsible for licensing of all cannabis businesses. On or about September 15, 2021, the DCC filed emergency regulations to consolidate, clarify, and make consistent cannabis regulations to the California Office of Administrative Law. After a limited comment period, these consolidated emergency regulations were approved and became effective on or about September 27, 2021. These regulations created consistent standards for cannabis licensees across all license types, by aligning application requirements, unifying terminology, and clarifying ownership and financial interest requirements. Consolidated regulations became effective on a non-emergency basis on November 7, 2022. Additional regulatory amendments promulgated in 2022 include requirements and procedures to apply to DCC for a Large Cultivation License under MAUCRSA and emergency rules for track and trace requirements for delivery vehicles. 
 Additional statutory amendments signed into law in 2022, include, among other things, classification of cannabis beverages as a form of edible cannabis product and allowance of more packaging types for beverages, requiring applicants with 20 or more employees to execute labor peace agreements (this requirement applies to applicants with 10 or more employees after July 1, 2024), additional taxation rules, new advertising and labeling rules for cannabis vaporizer products, and a prohibition on local laws that prohibit delivery of medicinal products to qualifying patients. 
 At present, to legally operate a medical or adult-use cannabis business in California, the operator must have both a local and state license. This requires license holders to operate in cities with marijuana licensing programs. Therefore, cities in California are allowed to determine the number of licenses they will issue to marijuana operators or can choose to outright ban marijuana. 
 Columbia Care (through its subsidiaries in the State of California) follows applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of California.

 Adult-Use and Medicinal Provisional Retailer License 

California Licensing Requirements 
 A medicinal retailer license permits the sale of medicinal cannabis and cannabis products to a medicinal cannabis patient in California who possesses a physician s recommendation. Only certified physicians may provide medicinal marijuana recommendations. An adult-use retailer license permits the sale of cannabis and cannabis products to any individual age 21 years of age or older who presents a valid government-issued photo identification. 
 An adult-use or medicinal cultivation license permits cannabis cultivation activity which means any activity involving the planting, growing, harvesting, drying, curing, grading or trimming of cannabis. Such licenses further permit the production of a limited number of non-manufactured cannabis products and the sales of cannabis to certain licensed entities within the state of California for resale or manufacturing purposes. 
 An adult-use or medical manufacturing license permits the manufacturing of cannabis products. Manufacturing includes the compounding, blending, extracting, infusion, packaging or repackaging, labeling or relabeling, or other preparation of a cannabis product. 
 In the state of California, only cannabis that is grown in the state can be sold in the state. Although California is not a vertically-integrated system, the state allows licensees to make wholesale purchase of cannabis from, or a distribution of cannabis and cannabis product to, another licensed entity within the state. 
 Holders of marijuana licenses in California are subject to a detailed regulatory scheme encompassing: security, staffing, sales, manufacturing standards, inspections, inventory, advertising and marketing, product packaging and labeling, records and reporting, and more. As with all jurisdictions, the full regulations, as promulgated by each applicable state agency, should be consulted for further information about any particular operational area. 
 
 California Dispensary Requirements 
 Cannabis retailers may only sell cannabis products that were received by the retail licensee from a licensed distributor or licensed microbusiness authorized to engage in distribution, and the licensed retailer must verify that the cannabis goods have not exceeded their best-by, sell-by, or expiration date if one is provided. The goods must have undergone appropriate laboratory testing, and the batch number labeled on the package of cannabis goods must match the batch number on the corresponding certificate of analysis for regulatory compliance testing. The packaging and goods must comply with all applicable laws in order for the goods to be sold at the 
 33 

retail location. In addition to cannabis goods, a licensed retailer may sell only cannabis accessories and licensee s branded merchandise. A licensed retailer may not provide free cannabis goods except for in certain limited circumstances. 
 Cannabis retailers may only display cannabis goods for inspection and sale in the retail area. Such goods may be removed from their packaging and placed in containers to allow for customer inspection, so long as the containers are not readily accessible to customers without assistance of retailer personnel. A container must be provided to the customer by the licensed retailer or its employees, who must remain with the customer at all times that the container is being inspected by the customer. Cannabis goods removed from their packaging in this way may not be sold or consumed. They must be destroyed appropriately when they are no longer being used for display. 
 California Reporting Requirements 
 The state of California uses METRC as the state s track-and-trace T T system used to track commercial cannabis activity and movement across the distribution chain for all state-issued annual licensees. The system allows for other third-party system integration via application programming interface. Only licensees have access to METRC. 
 California Storage, Transportation, and Security Requirements 
 To ensure the safety and security of cannabis business premises and to maintain adequate controls against the diversion, theft, and loss of cannabis or cannabis products, California s marijuana businesses are required to do the following: 
 maintain a fully operational security alarm system; 

contract for security guard services; 

maintain a video surveillance system that records continuously 24 hours a day; 

ensure that the facility s outdoor premises have sufficient lighting; 

not dispense from its premises outside of permissible hours of operation; 

store cannabis and cannabis product only in areas per the premises diagram submitted to the state of California during the licensing process; 

store all cannabis and cannabis products in a secured, locked room or a vault; 

report to local law enforcement within 24 hours after being notified or becoming aware of the theft, diversion, or loss of cannabis; and 

ensure the safe transport of cannabis and cannabis products between licensed facilities, maintain a delivery manifest in any vehicle transporting cannabis and cannabis products. Only vehicles registered with the BCC that meet BCC distribution requirements are to be used to transport cannabis and cannabis products. 

DCC Inspections 
 The DCC, and its authorized representatives, shall have full and immediate access to inspect and enter onto any premises licensed by the DCC. Prior notice of an inspection, investigation, review, or audit is not required. The DCC may also test any vehicle or equipment possessed by, in control of, or used by a licensee or their agents and employees for the purpose of conducting commercial cannabis activity. Moreover, it may test any cannabis goods or cannabis-related materials, or products possessed by, in control of, or used by a licensee or their agents and employees for the purpose of conducting commercial cannabis activity. The DCC may also copy any materials, books, or records of any licensee or their agents and employees. Failure to cooperate with and participate in any DCC investigation pending against the licensee may result in a licensing violation subject to discipline. 
 COLORADO 
 Colorado Regulatory Landscape 
 On November 7, 2000, Colorado voters approved Amendment 20, which amended the state constitution to allow the use of marijuana in the state by approved patients with written medical consent. On November 6, 2012, Colorado voters approved Amendment 64, which amended the state constitution to establish an adult use cannabis program in Colorado and permit the commercial cultivation, manufacture and sale of marijuana to adults 21 years of age or older. The commercial sale of marijuana for adult use to the general public began on January 1, 2014 at cannabis businesses licensed under the regulatory framework. As of January 1, 2020, medical and adult use marijuana are regulated together under a single statute the Colorado Marijuana Code.

Under the Colorado Marijuana Code, the Marijuana Enforcement Division of the Colorado Department of Revenue is empowered to grant licenses to both adult use and medical marijuana businesses, including cultivation facilities, products manufacturers, testing facilities, transporters, researchers and developers, and (in the adult use context) accelerator cultivators, accelerator stores, and hospitality businesses. The Colorado Marijuana Code underwent amendments in 2022, which include, among other things, changes to the requirements for physical or virtual separation of operations for co-located adult use and medical dispensaries, transfers of product between commonly owned medical and adult use marijuana cultivation facilities, responsible vendor training, and limitations on the use of modified or synthetic intoxicating cannabanoids. The MED promulgated comprehensive amendments to its regulations effective December 1, 2022. Cannabis businesses must also comply with local licensing requirements. Colorado localities are allowed to limit or prohibit the operation of marijuana businesses. Columbia Care in Colorado follows the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Colorado.

Currently in the process of renewal 
 With respect to the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and no substantial violations exist, Columbia Care would expect to receive the applicable renewed licenses in the ordinary course of business. 
 
 Regulatory Requirements 
 The regulations establish requirements applicable to all marijuana businesses, along with specific requirements for each type of business. 
 All marijuana businesses in Colorado are required to (1) create and enforce limited access areas for the protection of marijuana and marijuana products, (2) maintain security alarm systems installed and maintained by a licensed alarm installation company, as well as approved locks and surveillance equipment, (3) follow all applicable laws regarding waste disposal (including cannabis-containing wastes), (4) implement an inventory tracking system used for inventory tracking and recordkeeping, (5) comply with both state and local requirements as to hours of operation, (6) comply with sanitary requirements applicable to employees and production spaces, including sanitation audits, (7) comply with recordkeeping requirements, and (8) maintain and provide procedures for dealing with product recalls. 
 Cultivation facilities are additionally required to (1) provide and maintain copies of standard operating procedures for cultivation, harvesting, drying, curing, trimming, packaging, storing, and sampling, (2) comply with requirements related to pesticides, and (3) comply with additional sanitary and product safety requirements. Marijuana products manufacturers are required to (1) comply with labeling and dosing requirements related to standardized doses of marijuana, (2) comply with specific prohibitions regarding the shapes, colors, and similar characteristics of edible products, refrain from use of prohibited additives and ingredients, (3) maintain and provide standard operating procedures related to manufacturing of each category of products. Marijuana dispensaries are subject to additional requirements regarding (1) methods of accepting orders, (2) payments by customers, and (3) identification of customers. 
 The Marijuana Enforcement Division and local licensing authorities may conduct announced or unannounced inspections of licensees to determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Licensees may also be subject to inspection of the licensed premises by the local fire department, building inspector, or code enforcement officer to confirm that no health or safety concerns are present. 
 Colorado uses METRC as the Marijuana Enforcement Division s marijuana inventory tracking system for all medical and adult use licensees. Marijuana is required to be tracked and reported with specific data points from seed to sale through METRC for compliance purposes under Colorado marijuana laws and regulations. This tracking is conducted by using electronic tags on plants and shipments between licensees and facilities.

DELAWARE 
 Delaware Regulatory Landscape 
 Delaware s medical marijuana program is governed by the Delaware Medical Marijuana Act, 16 Del. C. 
 4901A et seq. , and the Department of Health and Social Services (the Department implementing regulations, CDR 16-4000-4470. The program authorizes registered qualified patients with a debilitating medical condition to use marijuana. Debilitating medical condition includes: (a) terminal illness, cancer, HIV, AIDS, decompensated cirrhosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, agitation of Alzheimer s disease, PTSD, intractable epilepsy, seizure disorder, glaucoma, chronic debilitating migraines; (b) a chronic or debilitating disease or medical condition or its treatment that produces cachexia or wasting syndrome; severe, debilitating pain that has not responded to previously prescribed medication or surgical measures for more than 3 months or for which other treatment options produced serious side effects; intractable nausea; seizures; severe and persistent muscle spasms, including those characteristic of multiple sclerosis; and (c) other medical conditions or treatments that may be added by the Department. Citizens may petition the Department to add conditions or treatments to the list of debilitating medical conditions. 
 The medical marijuana program creates a licensing regime for medical marijuana compassion centers Compassion Centers ). Compassion Centers must be operated on a non-profit basis. Once registered, a Compassion Center may acquire, possess, cultivate, manufacture, deliver, transfer, transport, supply, or dispense marijuana strictly for the purpose of assisting registered patients or their designated caregivers with the medical use of marijuana. Compassion Centers are required to grow an amount of marijuana sufficient to meet demand but may not possess more than 1,000 pounds of usable marijuana without having a variance approved by the Department. Delaware prohibits Compassion Centers from purchasing marijuana from any person other than another Compassion Center. 
 On May 24, 2022, Governor John Carney vetoed legislation passed by the Delaware General Assembly that would have legalized the adult use of cannabis, and created a state-run commercial adult-use cannabis program. Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the State of Delaware) follows the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Delaware. 
 Delaware License Requirements 
 Applicants for a license to operate a Compassion Center must include a US 5,000 application fee along with identifying documentation about the proposed Compassion Center, such as the proposed legal name, bylaws, articles of incorporation, and proposed address. An application must include information about the proposed facility, including: a description of the enclosed, locked facility, meeting all Department requirements for use in the cultivation of marijuana; and a description of proposed security and safety measures which demonstrate compliance with the Department s regulations. The Department also requires applicants to disclose financial and organizational information. Such information must include evidence of the Compassion Center s non-profit status; identifying information for each principal officer and board member; a draft operations manual which demonstrates compliance with the Department s regulations; a list of persons or business entities having direct or indirect authority over the management or policies of the Compassion Center; a list of persons or business entities having 5.0 or more ownership in the Compassion Center, including owners of any business entity which owns all or part of the land or building; and the identities of creditors holding a security interest in the premises, if any. Applications must also include an example of the design and security features of medical marijuana containers which demonstrates compliance with the regulations. In 2022, the Delaware General Assembly amended the Delaware Medical Marijuana Act to require applicants with 20 or more employees to execute a labor peace agreement. 
 When the Department notifies an applicant that its application to operate a Compassion Center has been approved, it must submit a number of additional items before the registration certificate authorizing operation of a Compassion Center will be issued: a certification fee of US 40,000; the legal name, articles of incorporation, and bylaws of the Compassion Center; the physical address of the Compassion Center and any other address used for cultivation; evidence of compliance with zoning laws, other location restrictions, and the State Fire Code; and updates to previously submitted information. 
 Delaware Dispensary Requirements 
 Registered Compassion Centers are required to keep detailed financial reports of proceeds and expenses; maintain inventory, sales, and financial records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and provide Department or Department-contracted audit firms with access to its books and records. 
 38 

Compassion Centers must comply with a detailed process for disposing of unusable marijuana. A Compassion Center must immediately update its inventory system to reflect a disposal of marijuana, and the marijuana waste must be stored, secured, and managed in a manner that renders the waste unusable. Delaware also prohibits the use of pesticides on marijuana. 
 The Department has promulgated regulations specific to the dispensing of marijuana. Marijuana must be dispensed in sealed, tamperproof containers clearly identified as having been issued by the Compassion Center and that include certain disclosures. The containers should be accompanied by written instruction that the marijuana shall remain in this container when it is not being prepared for ingestion or being ingested. Compassion Centers must verify the patient s or caregiver s identification card as valid before dispensing marijuana, and marijuana must not be dispensed to a person other than a qualifying patient or primary caregiver. The maximum amount a Compassion Center can dispense to a single patient is 3 ounces during a 14-day period.

 Delaware Security, Storage, and Transportation Requirements 
 Compassion Centers must store marijuana in a locked area with adequate security. The adequacy of security is to be determined based on the quantity of usable marijuana on hand, the Compassion Center s inventory system, the number of people with access to the marijuana, the location of the Compassion Center, the scope and sustainability of the alarm system, and the root cause analysis of any prior breaches. Compassion Centers are also subject to detailed security and inventory-management requirements. A Compassion Center must implement appropriate security and safety measures to deter and prevent the unauthorized entrance into areas containing marijuana and the theft of marijuana. This includes access and entry limitations; maintaining a fully operational alarm system with immediate automatic notification to alert local authorities of a security breach; maintaining a log of security inspections and tests, alarm activations, and security breaches; and instituting a 24/7 video surveillance system covering areas in which marijuana is handled. The Department has also instituted a number of inventory controls. Compassion Centers must utilize a bar-coding inventory control system to track sales and inventory data; store marijuana in a locked area with adequate security; and conduct and document monthly inventory reviews and bi-annual comprehensive inventory reviews. 
 A registered Compassion Center agent must have documentation when transporting marijuana on behalf of the registered Compassion Center that specifies the amount of marijuana being transported, the date the marijuana is being transported, the registry ID certificate number of the registered Compassion Center or registered safety compliance facility, and a contact number to verify that the marijuana is being transported on behalf of the registered Compassion Center or registered safety compliance facility. 
 39 

Department Inspections 
 Compassion Centers are also subject to inspections by the Department s Office of Medical Marijuana. These inspections may include: a review of the Compassion Center s financial and dispensing records; a review of the physical facility; an inspection for pesticides, fungus, or mold; and random sampling of marijuana plants. Moreover, the Department or an independent auditor with which it contracts shall at all times have access to all books and records kept by any Compassion Center. 
 FLORIDA 
 Florida Regulatory Landscape 
 In 2014, the Florida Legislature passed the Compassionate Use Act. The original Compassionate Use Act only allowed for low-THC cannabis to be dispensed and purchased by patients suffering from cancer and epilepsy. In 2016, the Legislature passed the Right To Try Act which allowed for full potency cannabis to be dispensed to patients suffering from a diagnosed terminal condition. Also in 2016, the Florida Medical Marijuana Legalization Initiative was introduced by citizen referendum and passed with a 71.3 majority on November 8. This language amended the state constitution and mandated an expansion of the state s medical cannabis program. 
 The Florida Medical Marijuana Legalization Initiative, Amendment 2 Amendment 2 ), and the expanded qualifying medical conditions, became effective on January 3, 2017. The Florida Department of Health, physicians, dispensing organizations, and patients are also subject to Article X Section 29 of the Florida Constitution and 381.986 of the Florida Statutes. On June 9, 2017, the Florida House of Representatives and Florida Senate passed respective legislation to implement the expanded program by replacing large portions of the existing Compassionate Use Act, which officially became law on June 23, 2017. The law regulating Amendment 2 provides for another four licenses to be issued for every 100,000 patients added to the state s medical marijuana registry and allows growers to open 25 dispensaries, plus an additional five dispensaries for every 100,000 patients. The 2017 legislation s cap on dispensing facilities expired on April 1, 2020 and there is now no limit. There is also no state-imposed limitation on the permitted size of cultivation or processing facilities in Florida, nor is there a limit on the number of plants that may be grown. In Florida, medical marijuana may not be wholesaled, except for limited circumstances in which a medical marijuana treatment center that seeks to make a purchase of marijuana presents proof of harvest failure to the Florida Department of Health, Office of Medical Marijuana Use OMMU ). 
 In 2022, the OMMU issued of notice of its intent to award one MMTC license to a so-called Pigford (Qualified Black Farmer) applicant, which is a recognized class member of Pigford v. Glickman, 185 F.R.D. 82 (D.D.C. 1999) or In re Black Farmers Litigation, 856 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2011). Certain Pigford applicants have appealed OMMU s denial of their license applications. Under emergency rules, the OMMU issued an application under which it will award up to 22 MMTC licenses to new applicants. License applications are due on or before April 28, 2023. Additionally, in 2017, the Florida legislature passed an act developing an industrial hemp pilot project, which created the framework for legalized industrial hemp in Florida. The pilot project allowed for the research of industrial hemp. In 2019, the State Hemp Program (the FL Act became effective and expanded the hemp program in Florida. The FL Act permitted the development of a state hemp plan by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services FDACS ). In 2020, FDACS submitted a state plan for regulation of industrial hemp to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for approval pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has approved Florida s plan. 
 The Florida Hemp Program includes several regulatory requirements. FDACS requires any individual or entity processing, manufacturing, distributing, retailing, or growing hemp to obtain a permit with FDACS. Other requirements include testing to ensure the hemp has a permissible THC level of under 0.3 ; inventory of land used for cultivation of hemp; disposal procedure plans; submission to inspection by and information sharing with FDACS; and state certification. Intentional violations of the Act and FDACS s rules may result in criminal penalties and a loss of license. Repeated negligent violation may result in a suspension of license. 
 Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the State of Florida) follows the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Florida. 
 Florida Licenses Subsection 381.986(8)(a) of the State of Florida Statutes provides a framework that requires licensed producers, which are statutorily defined as Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers MMTC ), to cultivate, process and dispense medical cannabis in a vertically integrated marketplace. The Florida Legislature amended the statute in 2022, among other things, to authorize OMMU to test samples from MMTCs and to require product recalls in certain instances. Licenses issued by the OMMU may be renewed biennially so long as the license meets the requirements of the law and the license holder pays a renewal fee. License holders can only own one license. 
 40 

Under the terms of its MMTC license, Columbia Care s 100 -owned subsidiary, Columbia Care Florida, is permitted to sell medical cannabis only to qualified medical patients that are registered with the state. Only certified physicians who have successfully completed a medical cannabis educational program can register patients and their medical cannabis orders on the Florida Office of Compassionate Use Registry. Dispensaries also must comply with a local municipality s zoning, which authorize such a use. The proposed site is zoned for a pharmacy and not within 500 feet of a church or school. In the State of Florida, only cannabis that is grown in the state can be sold in the state. As Florida is a vertically integrated system, Columbia Care Florida is able to cultivate, harvest, process and sell/dispense/deliver its own medical cannabis products.

 Authorizes Columbia Care Florida to cultivate, process, transport and dispense cannabis for medical use 

Florida Reporting Requirements OMMU requires that any licensee establish, maintain, and control a computer software tracking system that traces cannabis from seed to sale and allows real-time, 24-hour access by the OMMU to such data. The tracking system must allow for integration of other seed-to-sale systems and, at a minimum, include notification of when marijuana seeds are planted, when marijuana plants are harvested and destroyed, and when cannabis is transported, sold, stolen, diverted, or lost. Additionally, the OMMU also maintains a patient and physician registry and Columbia Care must comply with requirements and regulations relative to providing required data or proof of key events to said system. 
 Florida Licensing Requirements 
 Licenses issued by the OMMU may be renewed biennially so long as the licensee meets requirements of the law and pays a renewal fee, which OMMU raised significantly by emergency rule in 2022. Provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and there are no material violations noted against the applicable license, Columbia Care Florida would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business. 
 MMTC license holders can only own one license. An MMTC applicant must demonstrate that: (i) they have been registered to do business in the State of Florida for the previous five years, (ii) they possess a valid certificate of registration issued by the Florida Department of Agriculture, (iii) they have the technical and technological ability to cultivate and produce cannabis, including, but not limited to, low-THC cannabis, (iv) they have the ability to secure the premises, resources, and personnel necessary to operate as an MMTC, (v) they have the ability to maintain accountability of raw materials, finished products, and by-products to prevent diversion or unlawful access to or possession of these substances, (vi) they have an infrastructure reasonably required to dispense cannabis to registered qualified patients statewide or regionally as determined by the OMMU, (vii) they have the financial ability to maintain operations for the duration of the two-year approval cycle, including the provision of certified financial statements to the OMMU, (viii) its owners, officers, board members and managers have passed a Level II background screening, inclusive of fingerprinting, and ensure that a medical director is employed to supervise the activities of the MMTC, and (ix) they have a diversity plan and veterans plan accompanied by a contractual process for establishing business relationships with veterans and minority contractors and/or employees. Upon approval of the application by the OMMU, the applicant must post a performance bond of up to US 5 million, which may be reduced by meeting certain criteria such as serving at least 1,000 patients. 
 41

 ILLINOIS 
 Illinois Regulatory Landscape 
 The Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act, which allows individuals diagnosed with a debilitating medical condition access to medical marijuana, became effective January 1, 2014 and has since been made permanent and retitled as the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act. There are over 35 qualifying conditions as part of the medical program, including epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In January 2019, the Illinois Department of Health launched the Opioid Alternative Pilot Program, which provides access to medical marijuana for individuals who have or could receive a prescription for opioids. 
 Illinois enacted the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act in June 2019 (the IL Act ). The IL Act legalized the adult use of marijuana effective January 1, 2020. Under the IL Act, Illinois residents age 21 and older are allowed to possess any combination of (i) up to 30 grams of raw marijuana, (ii) marijuana infused products containing no more than 500 mg of THC; and (iii) 5 grams of marijuana in concentrated form. Non-residents can possess any combination of (i) up to 15 grams of raw marijuana, (ii) marijuana infused products containing no more than 250 mg of THC; and (iii) 2.5 grams of marijuana in concentrated form. The IL Act also authorizes the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation IDFPR to issue up to 75 Conditional Adult Use Dispensing Organization licenses before May 1, 2020 and an additional 110 conditional licenses during 2021. Existing medical dispensaries were able to apply for an Early Approval Adult Use Dispensing Organization License to serve adult users at an existing medical dispensary or at a secondary site. Columbia Care (through its subsidiaries in the state of Illinois) received licenses as Early Approval Adult Use Dispensing Organizations and is operating medical and adult use dispensaries in Illinois. No person can hold a financial interest in more than 10 dispensing organizations. 
 
 On July 15, 2021, Governor Pritzker signed House Bill 1443, now Public Act 102-0098, modifying the IL Act and the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act and establishing a more comprehensive criteria to award the adult-use licenses. Muliple lotteries and corrective lotteries for the adult-use licenses were held in 2021 and 2022. As of December 21, 2022, IDFPR has issued 192 Adult Use Dispensing Organization licenses to date. IDFPR announced an additional application period, ending April 21, 2023, to award an additional 55 Adult Use Dispensing Organization licenses by lottery. 
 
 The Illinois Department of Agriculture is authorized to make up to 30 cultivation center licenses available between the state s medical and adult-use programs. As with existing medical dispensaries, existing cultivation centers were able to apply for an Early Approval Adult Use Cultivation Center License. The Department has issued approximately 21 Early Approval Adult Use Cultivation Centers to date. Columbia Care (through its subsidiaries in the state of Illinois) received approval as Early Approval Use Cultivation Center and is operating as a medical and adult use cultivation center in Illinois. No person can hold a financial interest in more than three cultivation centers, and the centers are limited to 210,000 square feet of canopy space. Cultivation center are also prohibited from discriminating in price when selling to dispensaries, craft growers, or infuser organizations. The Department is also permitted to license up to 40 craft growers and 40 infuser organizations by July 1, 2020 and another 60 of each license type by the end of 2021. As of March 2, 2023, the Department has issued approximately 85 craft grower business establishment licenses and 55 business establishment infuser licenses. 
 The IL Act imposes several operational requirements on adult-use licensees and requires prospective licensees to demonstrate their plans for complying with the requirements. Applicants for dispensary licenses must, for example, include an employee training plan, a security plan, recordkeeping and inventory plans, a quality control plan, and an operating plan. Applicants for craft growers must similarly submit a facility plan, an employee training plan, a security a record keeping plan, a cultivation plan, a product safety and labeling plan, a business plan, an environmental plan, and more. 
 Licensees must establish methods for identifying, recording, and reporting diversion, theft, or loss, correcting inventory errors, and complying with product recalls. Licensees also must comply with detailed inventory, storage, and security requirements. Cultivation licenses are subject to similar operational requirements, such as complying with detailed security and storage requirements, and must also establish plans to address energy, water, and waste- management needs. Dispensary licenses will be renewed bi-annually, and cultivation licenses, craft grower licenses, infuser organization licenses, and transporter licenses will be renewed annually. 
 43 

The Illinois Department of Agriculture is authorized to promulgate regulations for cultivators, craft growers, infuser organizations, and transporting organizations, and the IDFPR is authorized to regulate dispensaries. The Department of Agriculture s final rules took effect on June 3, 2020, while the IDFPR has not yet issued comprehensive operational regulations for the adult- use program. 
 
 Additionally, in 2015, the Illinois Industrial Hemp Pilot Program became effective pursuant to the 2014 Farm Bill. This statute enabled researchers and higher education institutions to grow hemp for educational and research purposes. The Illinois Department of Agriculture IDOA administered the Industrial Hemp Pilot Program. In 2018, the Illinois Industrial Hemp Act (the IL Hemp Act became effective. The IL Hemp Act allowed for the growing and processing to expand beyond researchers and higher education institutions and allowed planting and processing by farmers and others. IDOA was given authority to develop and oversee rules for the state hemp program. 
 IDOA promulgated rules for the state s hemp program in 2019. An individual or entity cultivating, processing, or handling hemp must obtain a license from IDOA. The IL Hemp Act subjects licensees to several regulatory requirements. These include filing a report on the harvest and planting; submission to inspection and sampling at the discretion of IDOA; testing to ensure the hemp has a permissible THC level of under 0.3 ; and certain restrictions on the sale and transport of hemp. Intentional violations of the IL Hemp Act and IODA s rules may result in criminal penalties and a loss of license. Repeated negligent violation may result in a suspension of license. 
 In 2020, the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved the Illinois hemp production plan. 
 Columbia Care (through its subsidiaries in the State of Illinois) follows applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Illinois. 
 Illinois Licenses 
 The table below lists the licenses issued to Columbia Care with respect to its operations in Illinois.

As part of the pre-approval application, the applicant must submit information related to its operations; safety and security; medical cannabis professionalism; retail management factors; business and economic factors; and other additional factors that may apply. Columbia Care s 96 -owned subsidiary, Columbia Care MD LLC, received its final license in September 2019 to operate a dispensary. In November of 2022, Maryland voters adopted a ballot question (Question 4) amending the Maryland Constitution to legalize the adult use and possession of cannabis. Beginning on July 1, 2023, Question 4 allows adults age 21 or older in Maryland to possess and consume up to 1.5 ounces of cannabis flower, 12 grams of concentrated cannabis, or a total amount of cannabis products that does not exceed 750 mg THC.

 MASSACHUSETTS (MEDICAL) 
 The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has authorized the cultivation, possession and distribution of marijuana for medical purposes by certain licensed Massachusetts marijuana businesses. The Medical Use of Marijuana Program (the MUMP registers qualifying patients, personal caregivers, Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers MMTCs ), and MMTC agents. The MUMP was established by Chapter 369 of the Acts of 2012, An Act for the Humanitarian Medical Use of Marijuana , following the passage of the Massachusetts Medical Marijuana Initiative, Ballot Question 3, in the 2012 general election. Additional statutory requirements governing the MUMP were enacted by the Legislature in 2017 and codified at G.L. c. 94I, et. seq. (the Massachusetts Medical Act ). MMTC Certificates of Registration are vertically integrated licenses in that each MMTC Certificate of Registration entitles a license holder to one cultivation facility, one processing facility and one dispensary location. There is a limit of three (3) MMTC licenses per person/entity. 
 The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission CCC regulations, 935 CMR 501.000 et seq. Massachusetts Medical Regulations ), provide a regulatory framework that requires MMTCs to cultivate, process, transport and dispense medical cannabis in a vertically integrated marketplace. Patients with debilitating medical conditions qualify to participate in the program, including conditions such as cancer, glaucoma, positive status for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immune deficiency virus (AIDS), hepatitis C, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Crohn s disease, Parkinson s disease, and multiple sclerosis (MS) when such diseases are debilitating, and other debilitating conditions as determined in writing by a qualifying patient s healthcare provider. The CCC assumed control of the MUMP from the Department of Public Health on December 23, 2018. 
 Effective January 8, 2021, the CCC repealed certain regulations applicable to co-located medical and adult use facilities and incorporated them into the adult use regulations at 935 CMR 500.00 and the medical regulations at 935 CMR 501.000, as part of an overall update of both sets of regulations. The updated regulations also included the following significant changes: 
 permitting Marijuana Courier Licensees to deliver directly to consumers from the premises of licensed marijuana retailer establishments and Marijuana Delivery Operators to purchase wholesale marijuana products directly from marijuana cultivation and product manufacturer establishments and deliver the products directly to consumers from the Delivery Operator s warehouse location. Both Marijuana Courier and Marijuana Delivery Operator Licensees are reserved for at least 36 months for companies majority-owned and controlled by certain classes of certified Economic Empowerment or Social Equity applicants, for which Columbia Care does not quality; 

permitting Personal Caregivers to be registered to care for more than one and up to five Registered Qualifying Patients at one time; and 

permitting non-Massachusetts residents receiving end-of-life or palliative care or cancer treatment in Massachusetts to become Registered Qualifying Patients. 

Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts) follows the requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

For MMTC cultivation operations, there are 11 tiers of cultivator licenses ranging from a maximum of 5,000 square feet (Tier 1) to between 90,001 to 100,000 square feet of canopy (Tier 11). MMTCs can apply to change their tier classification to expand or reduce production. 
 The siting of MMTC locations is expressly subject to local/municipal approvals pursuant to state law, and municipalities control the permitting application process that an MMTC must comply with. More specifically, an MMTC shall comply with all local requirements regarding siting and unless a locality adopts a less restrictive requirement, an MMTC shall not be sited within a radius of five hundred feet of a school, daycare center, or any facility in which children commonly congregate. The 500-foot distance under this section is measured in a straight line from the nearest point of the facility in question to the nearest point of the proposed MMTC. The Massachusetts Regulations require that MMTCs limit their inventory of seeds, plants, and useable marijuana to reflect the projected needs of registered qualifying patients. An MMTC shall only dispense to a registered qualifying patient or caregiver who has a current valid certification. 
 Massachusetts Security and Storage Requirements (Medical) 
 An MMTC shall implement sufficient security measures to deter and prevent unauthorized entrance into areas containing marijuana and theft of marijuana at the MMTC. These measures must include: (i) allowing only registered qualifying patients, caregivers, dispensary agents, authorized persons, or approved outside contractors access to the MMTC facility; (ii) preventing individuals from remaining on the premises of an MMTC if they are not engaging in activities that are permitted; (iii) disposing of marijuana or byproducts in compliance with law; (iv) establishing limited access areas accessible only to authorized personnel; (v) storing finished marijuana in a secure locked safe or vault; (vi) keeping equipment, safes, vaults or secured areas securely locked; (vii) ensuring that the outside perimeter of the MMTC is sufficiently lit to facilitate surveillance; and (viii) ensuring that landscaping or foliage outside of the MMTC does not allow a person to conceal themselves.

The video surveillance system shall have the capacity to remain operational during a power outage. The MMTC shall also maintain a backup alarm system with the capabilities of the primary system, and both systems shall be maintained in good working order and shall be inspected and tested on regular intervals. 
 Massachusetts Transportation Requirements (Medical) 
 An MMTC, as an element of its License, is licensed to transport its marijuana to other licensed establishments. Marijuana may only be transported between licensed MMTCs by registered MMTC Agents. Licensed Marijuana Transporters may also transfer marijuana to or from an MMTC. The originating and receiving licensed MMTCs shall ensure that all transported Marijuana Products are linked to the Seed-to-sale tracking program. Any Marijuana Product that is undeliverable or is refused by the destination MMTC shall be transported back to the originating establishment. All vehicles transporting marijuana must be staffed with a minimum of two MMTC Agents. Prior to leaving an MMTC for the purpose of transporting marijuana, the originating MMTC must weigh, inventory, and account for, on video, all marijuana to be transported. Within eight hours after arrival at the destination MMTC, the destination MMTC must re-weigh, re-inventory, and account for, on video, the marijuana. The marijuana must be packaged in sealed, labeled, and tamper or child-resistant packaging prior to and during transportation. Transportation times and routes are randomized and all transport routes remain within the Commonwealth. If the transported product required temperature control, all vehicles and transportation equipment must provide adequate temperature control. Vehicles must also be equipped with a video system. 
 A vehicle used for transporting Marijuana Products must be: (i) owned or leased by the MMTC or otherwise licensed by the Commission as a third-party transporter; (ii) properly registered, inspected, and insured in the; (iii) equipped with an alarm system approved by the Commission; and (iv) equipped with functioning heating and air conditioning systems appropriate for maintaining correct temperatures for storage of marijuana. Marijuana must not be visible from outside the vehicle and a transport vehicle cannot bear any markings indicating that the vehicle is being used to transport marijuana. Once on board the vehicle, marijuana must be transported in a secure, locked storage compartment that is a part of the vehicle and cannot be easily removed. Vehicles must be equipped with a GPS meeting certain regulatory requirements, and agents must always have access to secure communication devices. 
 52 

The transporting MMTC Agents must contact the originating location when stopping at and leaving any scheduled location, and regularly throughout the trip, at least every 30 minutes. The originating location must have an MMTC Agent assigned to monitoring the GPS unit and secure form of communication, who must log all official communications with MMTC Agents transporting marijuana. Unexpected stops or incidents, along with discrepancies in inventory, must be reported to the Commission and to law enforcement. A manifest must accompany all deliveries. The manifest must include certain information specified by regulation to identify the shipping, transporting, and receiving persons; the products being transported; and more. Prior to transport, the manifest shall be securely transmitted to the destination MMTC by facsimile or email. On arrival at the destination MMTC, an MMTC Agent must compare the manifest produced by the agents who transported the marijuana to the copy transmitted by facsimile or email. Manifests must be retained for at least a year and made available to the CCC upon request. 
 Massachusetts Department Inspections (Medical) 
 The CCC or its agents may inspect an MMTC and affiliated vehicles at any time without prior notice. An MMTC shall immediately upon request make available to the CCC information that may be relevant to a CCC inspection, and the CCC may direct an MMTC to test marijuana for contaminants. Any violations found will be noted in a deficiency statement that will be provided to the MMTC, and the MMTC shall thereafter submit a Plan of Correction to the CCC outlining with particularity each deficiency and the timetable and steps to remediate the same. The CCC has the authority to suspend or revoke an MMTC license and to take other disciplinary actions against MMTC license holders. 
 MASSACHUSETTS (ADULT-USE) 
 Adult-use (recreational) marijuana has been legal in Massachusetts since December 15, 2016, following a ballot initiative in November of that year. The Cannabis Control Commission (the CCC ), a regulatory body created in 2018, licenses adult use cultivation, processing and dispensary facilities (collectively, Marijuana Establishments pursuant to 935 CMR 500.000 et seq. The first adult-use marijuana facilities in Massachusetts began operating in November 2018. In 2022, the Massachusetts Legislature amended the enabling legislation for the adult use program and MUMP to, among other things, render it unlawful for cannabis businesses to pay percentage-based fees to municipalities under the statutorily required Host Community Agreements with those municipalities. 
 Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts) follows the requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 
 Massachusetts Licensing Requirements (Adult-Use) 
 Existing MMTCs are given priority status over other applicants (except Economic Empowerment Priority Applicants) in applying for licensure as a Marijuana Establishment. However, the CCC has limited the scope of the priority applicant status to the functions and locations that the MTC currently operates. The same material application requirements exist for a Marijuana Establishment license as an MTC application; namely an application for an MTC license must include an Application of Intent, a Background Check, and a Management and Operations Profile including the content specified in the Massachusetts (Medical) section above. 
 
 The adult-use license application process commenced on April 1, 2018 for existing MMTC license holders, and on July 1, 2018 for all non-MMTC license holders. Existing MMTC license holders that timely applied for an adult-use license on or before April 1, 2018 are eligible to receive three adult-use licenses per medical MMTC license. Namely, one integrated MMTC medical license is eligible, if awarded by the CCC, to receive three adult-use licenses as follows: one for cultivation, one for processing, and one for dispensary. Additionally, there are 11 tiers of cultivator licenses ranging from a maximum of 5,000 square feet (Tier 1) to between 90,001 to 100,000 square feet of canopy (Tier 11). 
 Patriot Care Corp. applied for adult-use licenses for facilities in Lowell, Massachusetts and Greenfield, Massachusetts in May and June 2018. On September 6, 2018, the CCC approved provisional licenses for retail, manufacturing, and cultivation in Lowell, Massachusetts, and retail in Greenfield, Massachusetts. On January 25, 2019, the CCC approved and thereafter issued final marijuana establishment licenses for retail, manufacturing and cultivation of adult-use marijuana in Lowell and retail of adult-use marijuana in Greenfield. 
 The final licenses allow Patriot Care Corp. to operate the Marijuana Establishments. The licenses are listed in the table below.

 MISSOURI 
 Missouri Regulatory Landscape 
 Article XIV of the Missouri Constitution Article XIV provides that state-licensed physicians may recommend marijuana to patients for medical purposes and allows for the limited, regulated production, distribution, sale and purchase of marijuana for medical use. At a high level, Article XIV authorizes the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services DHSS to promulgate rules for the proper regulation and control of the cultivation, manufacture, dispensing, and sale of marijuana for medical uses, including the licensure of entities authorized to undertake those activities, operational standards for those activities, taxation of retail sales of marijuana for medical use, and the registration of qualified patients. In Missouri, a qualified patient is one that suffers from cancer, epilepsy, glaucoma, intractable migraines, a condition that causes severe and persistent pain, a debilitating psychiatric disorder, HIV/AIDs, a terminal illness, a chronic condition that normally requires a prescription medication that could be physically or psychologically addictive, or another chronic or debilitating condition as certified by a physician. 
 Pursuant to Article XIV, DHSS promulgated final rules governing the medical marijuana program in May 2019. Following promulgation of the rules, DHSS also undertook a process competitively to license entities in the areas of laboratory testing, cultivation, manufacturing, dispensing, and transportation in summer 2019. DHSS reported that it received approximately 2,270 applications for the various facility licenses, including 582 cultivation facility applications, 430 manufacturing facility applications, and 1,219 dispensary facility applications. Among these, DHSS issued 60 cultivation licenses, 86 manufacturing licenses, 192 dispensary licenses, and 10 laboratory testing licenses. These are the maximum number of licenses currently available under DHSS s regulations, though the regulations state that DHSS may in the future determine that additional licenses should be issued to meet the demand for medical marijuana of qualifying patients. In November of 2022, Missouri voters approved a ballot referendum (Missouri Amendment 3), which amended the Missouri Constitution to legalize the purchase, possession, consumption, use, delivery, manufacture, and sale of marijuana for personal use for adults over the age of twenty-one and levy a six-percent tax rate on the sale of adult use marijuana. Beginning December 8, 2022, Missouri Amendment 3 authorizes Missouri residents to legally possess up to 3 ounces of 
 56 

marijuana. DHSS adopted emergency regulations authorizing existing medical licensees to submit applications to convert to Comprehensive Facilities, which are defined as entities authorized to engage in adult use and medical operations. On December 8, 2022, DHSS began accepting applications for existing medical licensees to convert their medical licenses to Comprehensive Facility licenses. Columbia Care (thought its subsidiary) has applied for and received a Comprehensive Marijuana-Infused Products Manufacturing Facility License and a Comprehensive Marijuana Dispensary Facility License. The first adult use cannabis sales to consumers in Missouri were authorized by DHSS and occurred on February 3, 2023. Under the emergency regulations, applications for conversion to Comprehensive Facilities must (i) be submitted in a department approved online format; (ii) include a plan that explains how the applicant will serve both the medical and adult-use markets, while maintaining adequate supply at a reasonable cost to qualifying patients; (iii) include a plan to promote and encourage participation in the regulated marijuana industry by people from communities that have been disproportionately impacted by marijuana prohibition; and (iv) include a nonrefundable 2,000 fee. DHSS has 60 days to act on these conversion applications. DHSS will not issue additional medical, adult use or comprehensive facility licenses until such time as DHSS determines additional licenses are needed to meet the demand for marijuana product and ensure a competitive market while also preventing an over-concentration of marijuana facilities within the boundaries of any particular local government .

Missouri Regulations 
 DHSS s regulations, including the emergency regulations adopted by DHSS following passage of Missouri Amendment 3, establish both general requirements applicable to all licensed facilities, as well as specific requirements for various types of licenses, including manufacturing and dispensary licenses. 
 All marijuana facilities are required to implement inventory control systems that utilize a DHSS-approved seed-to-sale tracking system for the tracking of marijuana products through the seed or immature plant stage through to sale to a qualified patient (or compliant disposal). Marijuana facilities are required to install and maintain security equipment designed to prevent unauthorized entrance, and include components of intrusion detection, electronic video monitoring, access limitation and control, and training of security personnel. Marijuana facilities are also required to maintain policies and procedures for addressing recalls, and proper labelling and packaging of products. In general, medical marijuana facilities are not permitted to be operated within 1,000 feet of schools or religious facilities. Wastes from marijuana facilities, such as solid wastes and wastewater, must be disposed of in accordance with otherwise-applicable Missouri law regarding waste disposal. Marijuana wastes are also required to be rendered unusable by mixture with non-marijuana wastes. 
 Manufacturing facilities, in addition to complying with all otherwise-applicable requirements, are required to develop and maintain an odor mitigation plan, develop a protocol to ensure independent testing of products, plans for minimizing the risk of explosions and fires, and plans to transport medical marijuana to dispensaries in a manner that complies with applicable regulations. Manufacturing facilities that produce ingestible products are required to comply with all otherwise-applicable food safety standards under Missouri law. 
 Medical dispensary facilities, in addition to complying with all otherwise-applicable requirements, are required to maintain information accessible to qualified patients regarding such topics as addiction, different strains of medical marijuana and their effects, the risks of medical marijuana use, and prohibitions on consumption of medical marijuana in public places. Medical dispensary facilities are required to utilize point-of-sale systems that verify a qualified patient s purchases through the statewide track and trace system, and that require verification of the qualified patient s government-issued identification. A medical dispensary may not dispense medical marijuana in excess of what the qualified patient is permitted to purchase under the patient s physician authorization. Medical dispensary facilities are required to limit access to qualifying patients and primary caregivers, and to enforce limited access 
 57 

areas throughout the dispensary facility. 
 With regard to adult use consumers, dispensary facilities must have only one entrance at which patients and/or consumers are screened to verify patient status and/or age. There are similar rules with regard to point of sale and statewide track and trace procedures for adult use transactions as there are for medical marijuana transactions. 
 NEW JERSEY 
 New Jersey Regulatory Landscape 
 New Jersey s medical marijuana program is governed by the Jake Honig Compassionate Use Medical Cannabis Act, N.J. Stat. 24:6l-1 et seq. (the Medical Cannabis Law ), and the implementing regulations of the Cannabis Regulatory Commission (the Commission ), N.J.A.C. 17:30A et seq. Pursuant to the Medical Cannabis Law, qualifying patients with debilitating medical conditions may become registered to use medical marijuana. Debilitating medical conditions include: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, anxiety, cancer, chronic pain, dysmenorrhea, glaucoma, inflammatory bowel disease including Crohn s disease, intractable skeletal spasticity, migraine, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, opioid use disorder, positive status for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired deficiency syndrome (AIDS), post-traumatic stress disorder, seizure disorder including epilepsy, terminal illness with prognosis of less than 12 months to live, and Tourette s syndrome. The Medical Cannabis Law creates a permitting regime for alternative treatment centers ATCs ), which are vertically-integrated medical marijuana businesses. In addition, the Commission s regulations allow applicants for ATC permits to seek cultivation-, manufacturing-, or dispensing-specific licensure. Holders of an ATC license with a cultivation endorsement can possess, cultivate, plant, grow, harvest, and package usable marijuana; and can display, transfer, transport, distribute, supply, or sell marijuana to other ATCs, but not directly to registered qualifying patients. Holders of an ATC license with a manufacturing endorsement can possess and process usable marijuana; purchase usable marijuana from other ATCs possessing a cultivating endorsement; manufacture products containing marijuana approved by the Commission; conduct research and develop products containing marijuana for approval by the Commission; and can display, transfer, transport, distribute, supply, or sell marijuana and products containing marijuana to other ATCs, but not directly to registered qualifying patients. Finally, holders of an ATC license with a dispensary endorsement can purchase usable marijuana and products containing marijuana from other ATCs authorized to cultivate or manufacture usable marijuana or products containing marijuana; and can possess, display, supply, sell, and dispense, usable marijuana and/or products containing marijuana, to registered qualifying patients. 
 On July 2, 2019, New Jersey enacted the Jake Honig Compassionate Use Medical Cannabis Act that made several changes to the state s medical marijuana program. Amongst other changes, the NJ Act: (i) created the Commission, whereas the medical marijuana program was previously regulated by the New Jersey Department of Health, Division of Medicinal Marijuana DOH ); (ii) increases the monthly purchasing limit from two to three ounces of dry flower, and after 18 months allows the maximum to be adjusted by regulation; (iii) removes the purchasing limit for terminally ill and hospice patients; (iv) permits the sale of edible products; (v) phases out sales taxes on medical marijuana; (vi) provides reciprocity for patients registered with other state medical marijuana programs; (vii) authorizes home delivery to patients; and (viii) permitted ATCs to apply for up two additional satellite dispensing facilities, a right which expired as of January 2, 2021. 
 Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the State of New Jersey) is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of New Jersey for the medical marijuana program. 
 On February 22, 2021, the Governor of New Jersey signed into law an adult-use legalization bill entitled the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act, which legalized personal use cannabis for certain adults, subject to State regulations (the CREAMM Act ). The CREAMM Act provides ATCs specific expanded cultivation rights as well as the right to open up sales to the adult-use marketplace, subject to limited and specified conditions. As it relates to sales into the adult-use marketplace, the CREAMM Act permits ATCs to apply to the Commission for permission to operate as an Expanded ATC, i.e., servicing both the medical and adult-use marketplace, upon the demonstration of meeting the following two conditions:: (1) written approval to operate as an adult-use cannabis establishment from the municipality in which the ATC is located and compliance with said municipality s local zoning restrictions; and (2) the ATC s certification that it has sufficient quantities of medical cannabis and, if applicable, medical cannabis products, available to meet the reasonably anticipated needs of registered qualifying conditions. The CREAMM Act also permits ATCs to cultivate from up to two physical locations, provided that the ATC s combined mature cannabis plant grow canopy between both locations does not exceed 150,000 square feet of bloom space. 
 On August 19, 2021, the Commission approved the first set of rules governing the state s adult-use cannabis program. The rules will allow the CRC to begin licensing cannabis businesses. On November 23, 2021, the Executive Director of the Commission issued guidance to ATCs on the process for submitting Expanded ATC applications, Columbia Care s Expanded ATC application was approved by the Commission for its cultivation and manufacturing permits and two (2) retail dispensary locations in Vineland and Deptford on April 12, 2022, Columbia Care was approved to operate a second cultivation facility in Vineland on May 25, 2022, which 
 58 

was also approved for Expanded ATC operations on August 3, 2022. Nine (9) other fully licensed and vertically integrated ATCs have been approved to become Expanded ATCs. 
 
 The Commission has also begun licensing other Expanded ATCs as well as adult-use only cultivators, manufacturers, and retailers. Adult-use only licenses are subject to an open and rolling application period that first commenced through a notice of application acceptance for personal-use cannabis business licenses in November of 2021. The Commission opened applications for Class 1 Cultivators and Class 2 Manufacturers on December 15, 2021, followed by applications for Class 5 Retailers on March 15, 2021. The Commission anticipates soliciting applications for Class 3 Wholesalers, Class 4 Distributors, and Class 6 Delivery licenses sometime in 2023. To date, the Commission has issued notice of application approval for forty-three (43) Class 5 Retailers, fifteen (15) Class 2 Manufacturers, and twenty-five (25) Class 1 Cultivators, though none of these stand-alone adult-use licenses have become fully licensed and operational. New adult-use award winners have three hundred sixty-five (365) days from the date to the notice of approval to request a final onsite assessment and review from the Commission to become operational. 
 New Jersey Regulations ATC permits are awarded by a selection committee that evaluates applicants on the following general criteria: (1) submittal of mandatory organizational information; (2) ability to meet the overall health needs of qualified patients and safety of the public; (3) history of compliance with regulations and policies governing government-regulated marijuana programs; (4) ability and experience of applicant in ensuring an adequate supply of marijuana; (5) community support and participation; (6) ability to provide appropriate research data; (7) experience in cultivating, manufacturing, or dispensing marijuana in compliance with government-regulated marijuana programs; and (8) workforce and job creation plan. Information required to be submitted is wide-ranging, and includes identification information and background checks of principals, employees, directors, and other stakeholders, and evidence of compliance with certain state and local laws and ordinances. Columbia Care was awarded a vertically integrated ATC permit as a result of the result of a 2018 Request for Applications 2018 RFA ), along with five (5) other applicants selected for final approval for vertically integrated ATC permits by the DOH. The Commission has since approved an additional fourteen (14) ATC permits as part of the 2019 Request for Applications 2019 RFA ), inclusive of four (4) additional vertically integrated permits, ten (10) stand-alone cultivation permits and thirty (30) stand-alone dispensary permits. 
 In order for an ATC to become an Expanded ATC selling into both the medical and adult-use market it is required to certify to, among other things: (1) that the ATC has sufficient quantities of medicinal cannabis and medicinal cannabis products available to meet reasonably anticipated needs of registered qualifying patients, including through inventory data, projections, and supporting materials; (2) that the ATC will not make operational changes that reduce access to medicinal cannabis for currently and newly registered qualifying patients in order to operate a cannabis establishment, including through the submission of a detailed plan for prioritizing and meeting the needs of registered qualifying patients.

Permits expire annually on December 31 and require the submittal of a renewal application 60-days prior to the expiration of an ATC permit. Provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and there are no material violations noted against the permit, Columbia Care New Jersey would expect to receive a renewed permit in the ordinary course of business. 
 Adult-use licenses expire a year after issuance and require the submittal of a renewal application 90-days prior to the expiration of such licenses. For Expanded ATCs in particular, the first renewal application must be accompanied by a certification as to the continued material accuracy of the Expanded ATC s previously approved license application, submission of new written approval from the municipality in which the ATC is located, and the approval of all required renewal fees. Columbia Care New Jersey would expect to receive all requisite renewed adult-use licenses in the ordinary course. 
 New Jersey Dispensary Requirements 
 ATCs are subject to a number of regulations regarding their policies, procedures, records, and reporting, both under the medical and adult-use regulations. For example, ATCs must develop oversight procedures; procedures to ensure safe growing and dispensing operations; security policies; inventory protocols; disaster plans; pricing standards; and crime prevention plans and must maintain careful records, including organizational charts; facility documents; supply-and-demand projections; general business records; detailed sales records; and detailed personnel and training records. ATCs must provide substantial training for their employees and must maintain an alcohol and drug-free workplace. 
 Holders of an ATC permit are subject to a detailed regulatory scheme encompassing: security, staffing, point-of-sale systems, manufacturing standards, hours of operation, delivery, advertising and marketing, product labeling, records and reporting, age verification, and more. As with all jurisdictions, the full regulations (N.J.A.C. 17:30 et seq. and N.J.A.C. 17:30A) should be consulted for further information about any particular operational area. 
 
 New Jersey Storage, Security, and Transportation Requirements 
 Each ATC is required to provide effective controls and procedures to guard against theft and diversion of cannabis including, when appropriate, systems to protect against electronic records tampering. With respect to security and inventory protocols, ATCs are required to maintain robust security and alarm systems in good working order; test and inspect such security systems; employ policies to limit unauthorized access to areas containing marijuana; adopt security protocols to protect personnel; minimize exterior access and ensure the exterior of the facility has adequate lighting; and notify the proper authorities of reportable losses, security breaches, alarm activations, and electrical failures. ATCs are required to conduct detailed monthly inventories and an annual comprehensive inventory. 
 Each ATC must install, maintain in good working order and operate a safety and security alarm system at its authorized physical address(es) that will provide suitable protection 24 hours a day, seven days a week against theft and diversion and that provides, at a minimum: (i) immediate automatic or electronic notification to alert state or local police agencies to an unauthorized breach of security at the alternative treatment center; and (ii) a backup system that activates immediately and automatically upon a loss of electrical support and that immediately issues either automatically or electronic notification to state or local police agencies of the loss of electrical support. ATCs must also implement appropriate security and safety measures to deter and prevent the unauthorized entrance into areas containing marijuana and the theft of marijuana and security measures that protect the premises, registered qualifying patients, registered primary caregivers and principal officers, directors, board members and employees of the alternative treatment center. Each ATC must stablish a protocol for testing and maintenance of the security alarm system and conduct maintenance inspections and tests of the security alarm system at the ATC s authorized location at intervals not to exceed 30 days from the previous inspection and test, and it must promptly implement all necessary repairs to ensure the proper operation of the alarm system. In the event of a failure of the security alarm system due to a loss of electrical support or mechanical malfunction that is expected to last longer than eight hours, an ATC must notify the Department and either provide alternative security measures or close the affected facilities until service is restored. Finally, each ATC must equip its interior and exterior premises with electronic monitoring, video cameras, and panic buttons. 
 60 

Department Inspections 
 ATCs are subject to inspection by the Department at any time, with or without notice. ATCs must provide immediate access to all facilities, materials, and information requested by the Department. Failure to cooperate with an onsite assessment and or to provide the Department access to the premises or information may be grounds to revoke the permit of the ATC and to refer the matter to state law enforcement agencies. If a problem is discovered, the ATC must notify the Department in writing, with a postmark date that is within 20 business days of the date of the notice of violations, of the corrective actions the ATC has taken to correct the violations and the date of implementation of the corrective actions. 
 NEW YORK 
 New York Regulatory Landscape 
 In July 2014, the New York Legislature and Governor enacted the Compassionate Care Act (A06357E, S07923) (the CCA to provide a comprehensive, safe and effective medical marijuana program to meet the needs of New Yorkers. The program allows ten (10) registered organizations Registered Organizations to hold vertically integrated licenses and service qualified patients and caregivers. Limited product types are allowed in the state and smoking of cannabis flower is prohibited. The New York State Department of Health NYSDOH was the regulatory agency overseeing the medical marijuana program at that time. Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the State of New York) is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of New York. 
 On March 31, 2021, New York became the 16th state to legalize the adult-use of marijuana with the enactment of Senate Bill S854A, also known as The Marihuana Regulation and Taxation Act (the MRTA ). Under MRTA, the current medical marijuana program is set to undergo several changes. A new Cannabis Control Board, and within it the Office of Cannabis Management (collectively as the CCB an independent agency operating as part of the New York State Liquor Authority will be responsible for regulating the adult-use marijuana market as well as the existing medical marijuana and hemp cannabinoid programs Board. The list of medical conditions covered under the CCA will be widened to include additional qualifying conditions, medical patients will no longer be restricted from smoking medical marijuana, and the current limit on marijuana supply for medical patients will be doubled. Medical marijuana license holders may also be allowed to double their existing number of dispensaries for up to a total of eight dispensaries, but no more than three of the dispensary locations will be permitted to serve as adult-use marijuana retail stores. The legislation takes effect immediately, though full implementation will not occur until the Cannabis Control Board develops regulations for the adult-use marijuana program. It is currently expected that full implementation could take between 18 months to two years. 
 The CCB published proposed adult-use regulations in the New York State Register on December 14, 2022, with a comment period that closed as of February 13, 2023 (the Proposed Regulations ). Though the Proposed Regulations are subject to change, Registered Organizations are afforded the option of converting into one (1) of two (2) adult-use license types should they wish to convert to adult-use: (1) Registered Organizations Non-Dispensing ROND ), which is a hybrid-medical adult-use Registered Organization that is authorized to operate as an adult-use cultivator, processor, and distributor, but not converting any of its dispensing sites; or (2) Registered Organization with Dispensing ROD ), which is authorized to engage in adult-use cultivation, processing, distribution, and retail, but is only permitted to co-locate for medical and adult-use in three (3) of its four (4) dispensaries. The application to operate as either a ROND or ROD license must be accompanied by: (1) a community impact plan; (2) an energy and environmental plan; (3) a medical patient prioritization plan; and (4) a co-location retail dispensary operating plan if applying as a ROD. It is anticipated that the CCB will not begin accepting any applications for ROND or ROD until such time as the proposed regulations are made final. 
 The CCB has been issuing three (3) types of conditional licenses until such time as full adult-use regulations are finalized, including: (1) adult-use conditional cultivators AUCC: ); (2) adult-use conditional processors AUCP ); and (3) conditional adult use retail dispensaries CAURD ). The eligibility for participation in the AUCC and AUCP programs is limited to those that previously held licenses in the hemp and/or hemp cannabinoid programs. Participation in the CAURD program is limited to those entities 51 owned by individuals with prior marijuana convictions, charges, and/or arrests. To date, the CCB has issued: (1) two hundred thirty-three (233) AUCCs; (2) thirty-one (31) AUCPs; and (3) sixty-six CAURD licenses. 
 New York Licenses 
 Columbia Care NY LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Columbia Care, holds certificates of registration for manufacturing in Rochester, New York, and for dispensing in Riverhead, Brooklyn, New York (City), and Rochester, New York (collectively, the New York Licenses ). Pursuant to the CCA and Medical Use of Marihuana Regulations (Title 10, Chapter XIII, Part 1004) by the NYSDOH, the New York Licenses collectively permit Columbia Care NY LLC to acquire, possess, manufacture, sell, transport, distribute, and dispense medical cannabis in the State of New York.

During 2022, in conjunction with the proposed transaction with Cresco Labs, the Company reclassified certain licenses as held for sale in its New York, Massachusetts, and Illinois locations. Refer to Note 20 of the financial statements for additional details. 
 The New York Licenses are renewed every two years. Before the two-year period ends, licensees are required to submit a renewal application per guidelines published by the NYSDOH. While renewals are granted every two years, there is no ultimate expiry after which no renewals are permitted. Additionally, in respect of the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and there are no material violations noted against the applicable license, Columbia Care NY LLC would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business. 
 New York Regulations 
 The New York Licenses permit the sale of medical cannabis products to any qualified patient who possess a physician s recommendation. Under the terms of the New York Licenses, Columbia Care NY LLC is permitted to sell NYSDOH approved medical marijuana manufactured products to any qualified patient, provided that the patient presents a valid government-issued photo identification and NYSDOH-issued registry identification card proving the patient or designated caregiver meets the statutory conditions to be a qualified patient or designated caregiver. Registry identification cards are valid for one year after the date the certification is signed. The card contains the recommendation from the physician and the limitation on form or dosage of medical marijuana. 
 For a physician to recommend medical marijuana, the physician must pay for and pass a four-hour NYSDOH approved physician certification training program. The content of the course includes: pharmacology of marijuana; contraindications; side effects; adverse reactions; overdose prevention; drug interactions; dosing; routes of administration; risks and benefits; warnings and precautions; abuse and dependence; and such other components as determined by the commissioner. The CCB recently expanded this pool of recommending physicians by identifying that any practitioner who has a license to prescribe controlled substances may certify medical marijuana patients. 
 In order for a patient or registered caregiver to receive dispensed marijuana, they must be logged into the Prescription Monitoring Program PMP registry. The PMP registry is monitored by the NYSDOH and contains controlled substance prescription 
 62 

dispensing history and medical marijuana dispensing history to ensure that patients only receive a maximum of 30-days-worth of dispensed product from one Registered Organization. Only registered pharmacists can dispense medical marijuana to approved patients and caregivers. 
 Allowable forms of medical marijuana in New York State are the following: flower, metered liquid or oil preparations, solid and semisolid preparations (e.g. capsules, chewable and effervescent tablets, lozenges), metered ground plant preparations and topical forms and transdermal patches. 
 Medical marijuana may not be incorporated into food products by the Registered Organization, unless approved by the CCB. 
 Qualifying conditions in the state of New York are the following: cancer, HIV infection or AIDS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson s disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury with spasticity, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, neuropathy, Huntington s disease, certain types of severe debilitating pain, pain that degrades health and functional capability where medical marijuana is used as an opioid alternative, substance use disorder, or post- traumatic stress disorder. The severe debilitating or life-threatening condition must also be accompanied by one or more of the following associated or complicating conditions: cachexia or wasting syndrome, severe or chronic pain resulting in substantial limitation of function, severe nausea, seizures, severe or persistent muscle spasms, post- traumatic stress disorder, or opioid use disorder. 
 In the state of New York, only cannabis that is grown and manufactured in the state can be sold in the state. New York is a vertically integrated system; however, it does allow Registered Organizations to wholesale manufactured product to one another. As such, Columbia Care NY LLC is vertically integrated and has the capabilities to cultivate, harvest, process, transport, sell, and dispense cannabis products. Delivery is allowed from dispensaries to patients, however the delivery plan must be pre-approved by the NYSDOH. Columbia Care NY LLC obtained approval for its delivery plan in February 2017 and utilizes its 70 owned subsidiary, CC Logistics Services LLC, to provide home delivery services throughout the state. 
 
 New York Dispensary Requirements 
 A qualified pharmacist must be present at a dispensary whenever medical marijuana products are being dispensed or handled. Dispensing facilities can only sell approved medical marijuana products, related products necessary for the approved forms of administration of medical marijuana, and items that promote health and well-being subject to disapproval of the department and only in such a manner as does not increase risks of diversion, theft or loss of approved medical marijuana products or risk physical, chemical or microbial contamination or deterioration of approved medical marijuana products. 
 No medical marijuana products may be consumed at a dispensary. Dispensaries must maintain patient confidentiality, including by keeping security footage secure. Dispensaries must affix a label to each medical marijuana product which (1) identifies the patient and caregiver (if any); (2) contains the name of the certifying practitioner, (3) identifies the dispensary name, address, and phone number; (4) provides the dosing and administration instructions; (5) gives the quantity and date dispensed; (6) lists any recommendation or limitation by the practitioner as to the use of medical marijuana; and (7) includes the expiration date of the product once opened. Each package must also include a safety insert approved by NYSDOH and/or CCB. 
 New York Reporting Requirements 
 The state of New York has selected BioTrackTHC s solution as the state s T T system used to track commercial cannabis activity and seed-to-sale. The BioTrackTHC system is required to serve as all Registered Organizations patient verification system but is optional as the Registered Organization facing tracking system. Columbia Care NY LLC currently uses ADILAS Cannabis software as its inventory control system, and also uses BioTrackTHC on a limited basis. ADILAS is a robust system that enables users to track and generate inventory reports on demand with almost unlimited parameters and filters. While certain features of the system are available on the open market, Columbia Care s proprietary modifications have optimized its functionality to respond to the unique requirements of a highly regulated medical marijuana program, such as New York s. 
 Every month the CCB requests a dispensing report in Excel format, via email, showing the products dispensed for the month. This is the only report Columbia Care NY LLC is required to submit to the CCB. All other data is pulled by the CCB directly from Columbia Care NY LLC s seed-to-sale tracking system. 
 New York Storage, Transportation and Security Requirements Registered Organizations must comply with a range of storage and security measures designed to ensure the safety and security of the cannabis business premises and to maintain adequate controls against the diversion, theft, and loss of cannabis or cannabis products. Among other obligations, Registered Organizations are required to maintain a security operations plan that includes: an alarm system; 
 63 

motion detectors; video cameras in areas that may contain marijuana; exportable video recordings that Columbia Care must retain for 60 days and make available to the CCB; measures to ensure adequate lighting; and other security measures. Registered Organizations must work to ensure that manufacturing and dispensing facilities maintain all security system equipment and recordings in a secure location with access limited to surveillance personnel, law enforcement, security system service employees, the CCB or its authorized representative, and others when approved by the CCB. Security equipment must be kept in working order and periodically tested. 
 Marijuana must be stored in a secure area accessible to a minimum number of employees to prevent diversion, theft, loss, and contamination or deterioration of the product. Approved safes, vaults or any other approved equipment or areas used for the manufacturing or storage of marijuana and approved medical marijuana products must be securely locked or protected from entry, except for the actual time required to remove or replace marijuana or approved medical marijuana products. 
 Prior to transporting medical marijuana, Registered Organizations must complete a shipping manifest using a form determined by the CCB. A copy of the shipping manifest must be transmitted to the destination that will receive the products and to the CCB at least two Business Days prior to transport unless otherwise expressly approved by the CCB. In this regard, the Registered Organization must maintain shipping manifests and make them available to the CCB for inspection upon request, for a period of 5 years. Approved medical marijuana products must be transported in a locked storage compartment that is part of the vehicle transporting the marijuana and in a storage compartment that is not visible from outside the vehicle. Employees, when transporting approved medical marijuana products, travel directly to their destination(s) and may not make unnecessary stops in between. Delivery times must be randomized, transportation vehicles must be staffed by at least two employees, and a copy of the shipping manifest must be on hand while transporting or delivering approved medical marijuana products. 
 NYSDOH Inspections 
 All registered organizations must make their books, records, and facilities available to CCB for monitoring, on- site inspection, and audit purposes, including but not limited to periodic inspections and evaluations. If a problem is found by CCB, the registered organization must submit a plan of correction within 15 days. 
 New York Hemp 
 The CCB also has regulatory authority over New York s industrial hemp program. That program creates a licensing regime for growers, processors, retailers, and of industrial hemp and hemp cannabinoid products, and subjects such licensees to recordkeeping, product-quality testing, transportation, disposal, and security requirements. The CCB has authority to inspect a registered premises as often and to the extent necessary to ensure compliance with hemp laws and regulations. 
 OHIO 
 Ohio Regulatory Landscape 
 House Bill 523, effective on September 8, 2016, legalized medical marijuana in Ohio. The Ohio Medical Marijuana Control Program MMCP allows people with certain medical conditions, upon the recommendation of an Ohio- licensed physician certified by the State Medical Board, to purchase and use medical marijuana. House Bill 523 required that the framework for the MMCP would be in place no later than September 2018. This timeframe allowed for a deliberate process to ensure the safety of the public and to promote access to a safe product. Sales of medical marijuana in Ohio began in January 2019. 
 The following three state government agencies are responsible for the operation of the MMCP: (i) the Ohio Department of Commerce is responsible for overseeing medical marijuana cultivators, processors and testing laboratories; (ii) the State of Ohio Board of Pharmacy is responsible for overseeing medical marijuana retail dispensaries, the registration of medical marijuana patients and caregivers, the approval of new forms of medical marijuana and coordinating the Medical Marijuana Advisory Committee; and (iii) the State Medical Board of Ohio is responsible for certifying physicians to recommend medical marijuana and may add to the list of qualifying conditions for which medical marijuana can be recommended. Qualifying medical conditions for medical marijuana include: HIV/AIDS, Lou Gehrig s disease, Alzheimer s disease, Cancer, Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Crohn s disease, epilepsy or other seizure disorder, fibromyalgia, glaucoma, hepatitis C, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), pain (either chronic, severe, or intractable), Parkinson s disease, PTSD, sickle cell anemia, spinal cord disease or injury, Tourette s syndrome, traumatic brain injury, ulcerative colitis. In order for a patient to be eligible to obtain medical marijuana, a physician must make the diagnosis of one of these conditions. The Board of Pharmacy is in the process of revising its regulations for dispensaries, for the forms and methods for administering medical marijuana, and for patients and caregivers. 
 Several forms of medical marijuana are legal in Ohio, these include: inhalation of marijuana through a vaporizer (not direct smoking), oils, Tinctures, plant material, edibles, patches and any other forms approved by the State Board of Pharmacy. On November 18, 
 64 

2021, the Ohio Board of Pharmacy closed its Request for Applications process to solicit applications for up to 73 new dispensary licenses. The Board of Pharmacy awarded these provisional dispensary licenses in early 2022. Also in 2022, the Board of Pharmacy amended its regulations to, among other things, add new requirements for renewals of dispensary key employee registrations and dispensary financial audits submitted to the Board. The Department of Commerce also amended its regulations in 2022 to, among other things, add new testing requirements and require patient caregivers to be Ohio residents. 
 Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the State of Ohio) follows the applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Ohio.

All records relating to the purchase or return, dispensing, distribution, destruction, and sale of medical cannabis must be maintained under appropriate supervision and control to restrict unauthorized access on the licensed premises for a five-year period. 
 Ohio Reporting Requirements 
 Ohio uses the METRC system as its seed-to-sale tracking system. Licensees are required to use METRC to push data to the state to meet all of the reporting requirements. Dispensaries must use METRC to provide data to the Ohio Board of Pharmacy on a real-time basis. The following data must be transmitted: (a) each transaction and each day s beginning inventory, acquisitions, sales, disposal and ending inventory, (b) acquisitions of medical cannabis from a licensed processor or cultivator holding a plant-only processor designation, (c) name and license number of the licensed dispensary employee receiving the medical cannabis and, (d) other information deemed appropriate by the Ohio State Board of Pharmacy. A dispensary s designated representative shall conduct the inventory at least once a week. Records of each day s beginning inventory, acquisitions, sales, disposal and ending inventory shall be kept for a period of three years. 
 Ohio Storage, Transportation, and Security Requirements 
 The regulations permit Columbia Care OH LLC to store medical marijuana inventory at its cultivation facility in a designated, enclosed, locked facility identified in its plans and specifications that it submitted to the Ohio Department of Commerce. This storage area can only be accessible by authorized individuals. On an annual basis and as a condition to renewal of its cultivator license, Columbia Care OH LLC must perform a physical, manual inventory, of the medical marijuana on hand and compare it to the annual report generated by the inventory tracking system. The cultivation facility must install a commercial grade security alarm system to prevent and detect diversion, theft, or loss. The facility also must maintain surveillance equipment to capture the entire facility and 
 66

 Department of Commerce Inspections 
 The Ohio Department of Commerce may, at any time it determines an inspection is needed, with or without notice, conduct an inspection of a cultivator to ensure compliance with the facility s application and state laws and regulations. An inspection of a cultivator may include, without limitation, investigation of standards for safety from fire on behalf of the department by the local fire protection agency. If a local fire protection agency is not available, the division of state fire marshal may conduct the inspection after the cultivator pays the appropriate fee to the division of state fire marshal for such inspection. If a problem is detected during an inspection, the cultivator must produce a plan of correction within ten business days. Board of Pharmacy Inspections The Board of Pharmacy may conduct unannounced dispensary inspections and testing of medical marijuana samples. The Board enter dispensaries and conduct inspections of all areas and of all pertinent equipment, containers and materials and data. 
 PENNSYLVANIA 
 Pennsylvania Regulatory Landscape 
 The Pennsylvania medical marijuana program was signed into law on April 17, 2016 under Act 16 and provided access to state residents with one of 17 qualifying conditions, including epilepsy, chronic pain, and PTSD. The state, which consists of over 12 
 67 

million U.S. citizens and qualifies as the fifth largest population in the US, operates as a high- barrier market with very limited market participation. The state originally awarded only 12 licenses to cultivate/process and 27 licenses to operate retail dispensaries (which entitled holders to up to three medical dispensary locations). 
 On March 22, 2018, it was announced that the final phase of the Pennsylvania medical marijuana program would be initiated, which would include the issuance of 13 additional cultivation/processing licenses and 23 additional dispensary licenses. This application period ran from April 2018 through May 17, 2018. The Pennsylvania Department of Health announced the results of the application period, granting 23 new dispensary permits and 13 grower/processor permits across six regions of the state, on December 18, 2018. 
 In the introductory months of the program, Pennsylvania s medical marijuana dispensaries experienced supply shortages that rendered the market unable to keep up with demand. It was announced on April 17, 2018 that dry flower would be included in the regulations as an approved product form for sale and consumption (in addition to the already approved forms of concentrates, pills, and tinctures). Simultaneously, it was announced that the list of qualifying conditions would expand from 17 to 21, including additions of cancer remission therapy and opioid-addiction therapy. In July of 2019, the Pennsylvania Department of Health expanded the list of qualifying medical conditions to include anxiety disorders and Tourette syndrome, increasing the number of qualifying conditions to 23. 
 On June 30, 2021, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf signed into law H.B. 1024 (also known as Act 44), which made revisions to Pennsylvania s medical marijuana program, including codification of certain practices permitted under emergency orders issued in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The changes permit a wider range of individuals to serve as caregivers, including employees of long-term care and nursing facilities. The changes also permit dispensaries some additional operational flexibilities, including providing limited, on-site outdoor order pickups, providing remote patient consultations, and providing medical dosages up to a 90 days' supply as opposed to a 30 days' supply. 
 On March 5, 2021, the Department of Health proposed permanent regulations relating to medical marijuana, replacing the temporary regulations governing the program through its history. These proposed regulations are in substantially the same form as the temporary regulations, with only a few distinctions. One proposed revision identifies that a medical marijuana organization s change in ownership without the Department s knowledge and written approval of all individuals affiliated with the medical marijuana organization would be a violation of the act and proposed rules. The proposed regulations also require dispensaries and grower/processors to supplement ongoing reports to the Department with information related to the average price per unit of medical marijuana products sold, as opposed to the per-dose price. The proposed rules also augment the list of reasons for which the Department may suspend or revoke a medical marijuana organization s permit by adding falsification of information on any applications submitted to the Department. The proposed regulations also address training, identifying that principals, as well as employees, who have direct contact with patients or caregivers or who physically handle medical marijuana plants, seeds and products must also complete a training. Other changes include corresponding changes to caregiver and patient supply rules consistent with Act 44.Also consistent with Act 44 licensed Grower Processors in Pennsylvania may obtain hemp and hemp-derived CBD from hemp licensed in the state of Pennsylvania.The Department of Health promulgated final regulations that became effective March 4, 2023. 
 Additionally, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture administers an Industrial Hemp Research Pilot Program, as permitted by the federal Industrial Hemp Research Act of 2016 (P.L. 822, No. 92). As it is allowed to do under the 2018 Farm Bill, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will submit a regulatory plan to the U.S. Department of Agriculture program to administer a larger Industrial Hemp Program, including licensing the cultivation of hemp, as defined by federal law, for interstate commercial purposes. In January of 2019, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture lifted its 100-acre acreage cap on permitted hemp cultivators to grow unlimited acreage on locations approved under pre-existing permits. 
 Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the State of Pennsylvania) follows applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Pennsylvania. 
 Pennsylvania Licenses 
 Under applicable laws, the license permits Columbia Care to purchase marijuana and marijuana products from cultivation/processing facilities, and to sell marijuana and marijuana products to registered patients pursuant to the terms of the license. The license is issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Health (the Department under the provisions of the Medical Marijuana Act (35 P.S. 10231.101 10231.2110) and Chapters 1141, 1151 and 1161 of the Pennsylvania regulations. The license is, as of the date hereof, active with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. 
 All dispensaries must register with the Department. Registration certificates are valid for a period of one year and are subject to annual renewals after required fees are paid and the business remains in good standing. Renewal requests are typically communicated through email and include a renewal form. Provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely 
 68 

manner, and there are no material violations noted against the applicable license, Columbia Care would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business.

Pennsylvania Dispensary Requirements In order to maintain its permit, a dispensary must continue to meet all of the qualifications for obtaining such permit. Dispensaries must purchase marijuana only from authorized growers and processors. They may sell devices related to the use of medical marijuana, but only with the Department s prior written approval. Dispensaries must require a valid identification card from each patient or caregiver and verify it via electronic tracking system before dispensing any product. A dispensary may not dispense (1) a quantity of marijuana greater than the amount indicated on a patient s certification, (2) a form or dosage of product that is listed as a restriction or limitation on the patient certification, (3) or a form of medical marijuana product which is not permitted by law or regulation. Dispensaries cannot dispense more than a 90-day supply at one time, and subject to additional requirements in the Department of Health s final regulations. Moreover, dispensaries are subject to certain advertising and promotional restrictions. 
 Dispensaries must maintain their facilities in sanitary condition. Generally, employees working in direct contact with medical marijuana products must comply with the food-handling regulations of Pennsylvania. Employees and visitors must have access to adequate hand-washing facilities and sanitary lavatories. 
 Dispensaries may not employ individuals under the age of eighteen. A dispensary may not permit a patient to self- administer medical marijuana products at the facility unless the patient is also an employee of the dispensary, and the dispensary permits self-administration of medical marijuana products at the facility by the employees. 
 Pennsylvania Reporting Requirements 
 The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania uses MJ Freeway as the state s computerized T T system for seed-to-sale. Individual licensees are required to use MJ Freeway to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements. Columbia Care Pennsylvania LLC integrates its in-house software with the state s MJ Freeway program to capture the data points required by the Pennsylvania medical marijuana laws and regulations. 
 Pennsylvania Storage, Transportation, and Security Requirements 
 The regulations require a dispensary to have a locked limited access area for the storage of medical marijuana that is expired, damaged, deteriorated, mislabeled, contaminated, recalled or whose containers or packages have been opened or breached until such product is returned to the grower/processor. 
 Columbia Care Pennsylvania LLC must have a security system with professional monitoring, 24-hours a day and seven days a week, and fixed cameras on the interior and exterior of the facilities. The surveillance system must store data for a period of four years in a readily available format for investigative purposes. 
 Unless otherwise approved by the Department, a dispensary may deliver medical marijuana products to a medical marijuana organization only between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. for the purposes of transporting medical marijuana products among the permittee s dispensary locations and returning medical marijuana products to a grower/processor. Dispensaries may not transport medical marijuana products outside of Pennsylvania, and they must use a global positioning system to ensure safe, efficient delivery of the medical marijuana products to a medical marijuana organization. Dispensaries may not offer delivery of medical marijuana. Dispensaries must have an enclosed, secure area out of public sight for the loading and unloading of medical marijuana products into and from a transport vehicle. 
 All vehicles used in the transport of marijuana must be unmarked and equipped with a secure lockbox or locking cargo area. Products must be appropriately packaged and labeled. If transporting perishable medical marijuana products, they must be temperature controlled. They must display current inspection stickers and be insured for a commercially reasonable amount. Each vehicle must be staffed with at least two people while transporting marijuana, with at least one team member remaining in the vehicle at all times. Each team member must have access to a secure form of communication with the dispensary and have a valid driver s license. Team 
 69 

members must not wear clothing or symbols related to marijuana, and they must carry an identification badge or card at all times and produce it to law enforcement upon request. The team must also carry a transportation manifest and provide a copy to the recipient of the medical marijuana products. 
 Department Inspections 
 The Department may conduct announced or unannounced inspections or investigations to determine the medical marijuana organization s compliance with its permit and all relevant laws and regulations. Such inspection or investigation may include (1) inspection of a medical marijuana organization s site, facility, vehicles, books, records, papers, documents, data, and other physical or electronic information; (2) questioning of employees, principals, operators, financial backers, authorized agents of, and any other person or entity providing services to the medical marijuana organization; and (3) inspection of a grower/processor facility s equipment, instruments, tools and machinery that are used to grow, process and package medical marijuana, including containers and labels. Failure to provide immediate access to any of the materials, information, or individuals listed above may result in the imposition of a civil monetary penalty, suspension or revocation of the medical marijuana organization s permit, or an immediate cessation of its operations pursuant to a cease-and-desist order issued by the Department. 
 UTAH 
 Utah Regulatory Landscape 
 On December 3, 2018, Utah lawmakers passed House Bill 3001: Utah Medical Cannabis Act (the UT Act ). The Utah Act directs the Utah Department of Health (the Utah Department to issue medical cannabis cards to patients, register medical providers who wish to recommend medical cannabis treatment for their patients, and license medical cannabis pharmacies. Covered medical conditions include HIV/AIDS, ALS, cancer, cachexia, persistent nausea, Chron s disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, PTSD that is being treated and monitored by a licensed therapist, autism, certain terminal illnesses, and certain other rare conditions and diseases. The Act and subsequent amendments thereto authorized the Department to license and regulate up to 14 private entities to dispense medical cannabis products through medical cannabis pharmacies. The Utah Department has issued regulations governing medical cannabis pharmacies operations. The UT Act also grants the Department of Agriculture and Food regulatory authority over medical marijuana cultivators and processors. Effective July 1, 2021, all Utah medical cannabis cardholders are required to purchase their products from a Utah medical cannabis pharmacy. Out of state purchases and possession of medical cannabis are no longer permitted. 
 On January 3, 2020, the Department announced its intent to award 14 medical cannabis pharmacy licenses to companies selected from over 130 applicants. Columbia Care was selected to open a medical cannabis pharmacy in Springville, Utah, which is located just south of Provo. Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the State of Utah) is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Utah. Additionally, Utah law required the 15th pharmacy license to be given to a business located in specific rural counties. On November 18, 2021, the Department awarded the state s 15th medical cannabis pharmacy license to an existing Utah medical cannabis pharmacy operator that will open its facility in Price, Utah. 
 On February 28, 2020, the Governor signed legislation comprehensively amending the UT Act. Among the changes were the allowance of dosages in liquid suspension, allowance of medical cannabis pharmacies to sell certain CBD products, creation of partial-year limited licenses for cannabis processing licensing facilities and operation of an independent testing laboratory by the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food UDAF ), expansion of the authority of the state s Cannabinoid Product Board to review scientific research on the efficacy of products, and the state s Compassionate Use Board to hear petitions for use, relaxation of certain patient limits on use and validity of medical cannabis cards and restrictions on medical providers, direction to the Department of Health to authorize out-of-state residents to purchase medical cannabis, and permission to the UDAF to conduct random sampling of medical cannabis in medical cannabis pharmacies. 
 On March 24, 2022, Utah Governor Spencer Cox signed into law Senate Bill 195, which makes several changes to the medical marijuana program. These changes include the addition of acute pain for which a medical professional may generally provide opioids as a qualifying condition eligible for a limited supply of medical cannabis and amends requirements for medical cannabis advertising and renewing patient medical cannabis cards. 
 Additionally, in 2014, the Utah legislature passed the Hemp and Cannabinoid Act (the UT Hemp Act pursuant to the 2014 Farm Bill, which created the framework for legalized industrial hemp in Utah. The UT Hemp Act created a pilot program for hemp. Utah s 2019 amendments to the UT Hemp Act expanded the scope of the state s hemp program. In 2020, Utah amended the UT Hemp Act once again and directed the UDAF to develop a state industrial hemp production plan. In 2020, the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved the Utah Industrial Hemp Production Plan. 
 Under the UT Hemp Act, an individual or entity cultivating or processing industrial hemp must obtain an industrial hemp producer license. The industrial hemp production plan subjects licensees to several regulatory requirements. These include grower area requirements and reporting requirements; submission to inspection, sampling, and testing by UDAF to ensure the hemp has a 
 70 

permissible THC level of under 0.3 ; storage requirements; and destruction processes. Intentional violations of the UT Hemp Act or UDAF s rules, as well as repeated negligent violations, may result in loss of license. 
 Utah License Requirements 
 The Department announced its plans to award the 14 medical cannabis pharmacy licenses across four regions of the state. Columbia Care applied for a license in Region 3, which encompasses Utah County, where Springville is situated. The application process required Columbia Care to pay an application fee and to submit information regarding its ownership and directors, its finances, and a description of any past disciplinary actions for cannabis-related operations in any jurisdiction. Columbia Care was also required to submit highly detailed information regarding its experience, operating plan, strategic plan, local connections, and ability to keep the cost of medical cannabis low for patients. Such information included, for example: a list of all states in which Columbia Care operates; details of Columbia Care s proposed facility; a floor plan depicting the facility s security features; information about principles and key employees credentials, including a Utah licensed pharmacist; training and customer service information; storage protocols; a description of all medical cannabis products Columbia Care intends to offer; a financial plan; and Columbia Care s local connections to Utah. 
 License applications were then evaluated and scored by a committee based on several criteria, including: experience in the medical cannabis or other highly regulated industries, disciplinary action or investigation in other jurisdictions, an operating plan that will best ensure the safety and security of cardholders and the community, the extent to which an applicant can reduce the cost of medical cannabis, connections to the local community, and a strategic plan that has a high likelihood of success. Of the 14 licenses awarded by the Department, an initial group of eight pharmacies were given the option to open as soon as March 1, 2020, while the remaining six are allowed to open as early as July 1, 2020. Successful applicants were required to obtain a land-use permit for their medical cannabis pharmacy within 120 days of the license award if required by their county or locality. Final licensure is also subject to applicants owners passing criminal background checks and the Department approval of the applicants operating plans. Columbia Care satisfied these requirements and was issued a medical cannabis pharmacy license on April 22, 2021 authorizing Columbia Care to operate the pharmacy. 
 UDAF licenses medical cannabis processors and regulates the manufacturing and processing of medical cannabis into various medical cannabis products. Processors in Utah are responsible for dry, cure, extraction, refinement, formulation, packaging, and labeling of medical cannabis products. Utah has two tiers of processing licenses. A Tier 1 Processing License allows a facility to process, formulate, package, and label products. A Tier 2 License allows a facility to packaging and labeling or products. Currently UDAF is not restricting the number of either tier of processing licenses. 
 Columbia Care applied for a Tier 1 processing license. The processing license application process required Columbia Care to pay an application fee and to submit information regarding its ownership and directors, its finances, a description of any past disciplinary actions for cannabis-related operations in any jurisdiction and detailed property information, including, but not limited to facility square footage, type and location of equipment, and the location of all cameras and external lights. Columbia Care was also required to submit highly detailed information regarding its experience, and operating plan, Such information included, for example: a list of all products that will be produced; all extraction methods to be used, including solvents, chemicals and equipment; short and long-term storage protocols to ensure sanitary preservation of medical cannabis products; a recall plan; a disposal plan; and transportation and transfer plan, including the make and model of all vehicles Columbia Care will use to transport medical cannabis products. All Medical Cannabis Processing Facilities must comply with quality assurance testing, and obtain a Good Manufacturing Permit from UDAF s Regulatory Services. Final licensure is also subject to the payment of a 100,000.00 processing fee, securing a 50,000.00 performance bond, and successful completion of a pre-inspection to verify the processing facility meets all safety and security requirements. Columbia Care expects to satisfy these requirements in the ordinary course of business. 
 Utah Operating Requirements 
 Medical cannabis pharmacies in Utah are subject to several highly detailed operational requirements. The requirements impose restrictions on who may enter a pharmacy, who may be employed by a pharmacy, and on consuming cannabis on site. They require pharmacies to maintain sophisticated security infrastructure and policies designed to minimize the risk of diversion and to minimize access to cannabis products. These include, for example, maintenance of a physical surveillance system with video cameras located throughout the facility, a fail-safe backup system to support the system in the event of a power-outage; installation of an alarm system; and maintenance of safes and vaults for storing medical cannabis. 
 The operational requirements also govern the dispensing procedure. All cannabis sold must meet certain labeling requirements and transactions are subject to a number of verification, inventory, and record-keeping requirements. Unusable cannabis products must be properly disposed. The UT Act imposes limitations on the amount of cannabis a pharmacy can dispense to a single patient in a 28-day period. That amount is capped at the lesser of (a) a 30-day supply for treatment; (b) 113 grams of unprocessed cannabis; or (c) 20 grams of total composite THC. Utah law also allows pharmacies to dispense medical cannabis via home delivery. 
 71 

Medical cannabis pharmacies are required to employ a pharmacist-in-charge PIC ). The duties of the PIC generally include ensuring: the safe, informed, and appropriate distribution of medical cannabis and cannabis devices; protection, recording, and maintenance of patient records; education and training of pharmacy personnel; procurement of cannabis products and educational materials; appropriate disposal and storage of cannabis; controls against theft or diversion; compliance with applicable laws and regulations; quality assurance; maintenance of the point-of-sale system and integration with the state s inventory systems; and safe operation of the facility. Pharmacies must also be supervised by at least one licensed medical cannabis pharmacy medical provider PMP who must be present during all hours of operation.

 VIRGINIA 
 Virginia Regulatory Landscape 
 In 2017, Virginia commenced a program to allow registered patients to use CBD oil or THC-A oil. The program is governed by Va. Code Ann. 54.1-3442.5 et seq. , and by emergency regulations enacted by the Virginia Board of Pharmacy (the Virginia Board at 18 VAC 110-60-10 et seq. Registered patients means any Virginia resident who has received a written certification for the use of CBD oil or THC-A oil from a practitioner (which includes nurse practitioners and physician assistants) to alleviate the symptoms of any diagnosed condition or disease, and who has been issued a registration by the Virginia Board. Virginia s program allows the Virginia Board to license pharmaceutical processors, which are vertically integrated operations that can cultivate, process, and dispense CBD oil and THC-A oil in concentrations to be established by the Virginia Board that cannot exceed 10 mg of THC per dose. The oils can be processed into other formulations, such as capsules or lozenges. The state has limited licensure to one pharmaceutical process per health service area, as defined by the State Board of Health. There are currently five health service areas. Following an initial cultivation period, pharmaceutical processors cannot maintain more than 12 cannabis plants per patient and cannot maintain CBD oil or THC-A oil in excess of what is required for normal operations. 
 In 2020, Virginia passed an act amending and reenacting Va. Code Ann. 54.1-408.3 and 54.1-3442.5 et. seq (the Amendment ). The Amendment allows for cannabis dispensing facilities, allows patients who are temporary residents to register, permits access to cultivation areas of the processor without a pharmacist on site, permits the Board to establish standards for testing laboratories to obtain controlled substance registration, permits the sale of devices and inert sample products, allows wholesale distribution between processors and dispensing facilities, changes every reference of cannabidiol oil or THC-A oil to cannabis oil, deletes the requirement for an in-person examination by the prescriber certifying a patient to receive cannabis oil and allow the use of telemedicine in compliance with federal law, allows the pharmacist-in-charge to authorize certain employees to access secured areas when a pharmacist is not on site, and allows a ratio of six pharmacy technicians per one pharmacist working in the processor. 
 In 2020, the Virginia Board amended Title 18 of the Virginia Administrative Code 110-60, et. seq . and in February 2021, the Virginia Board adopted emergency rules amending Title 18 of the Virginia Administrative Code 110-60, et. seq. effective February 8, 2021 through August 7, 2022. These rules and emergency rules implement the changes as laid out in the Amendment. Cannabis dispensing facility means a facility that (i) has obtained a permit from the Board pursuant to 54.1-3442.6; (ii) is owned, at least in part, by a pharmaceutical processor; and (iii) dispenses cannabis oil produced by a pharmaceutical processor to a registered patient, his registered agent, or, if such patient is a minor or an incapacitated adult as defined in 18.2-369, such patient s parent or legal 
 72 

guardian. Temporarily resides means a person that does not maintain a principal place of residence within Virginia but resides in Virginia on a temporary basis as evidenced by documentation substantiating such temporary residence. 
 On April 7, 2021, a majority of both houses of the Virginia legislature voted to legalize adult-use marijuana. Virginia Senate Bill 1406/House Bill 2312 legalizes the retail sale of marijuana products to adults over the age of 21 and establishes the Virginia Cannabis Control Authority to oversee the cultivation, manufacture, wholesale, and retail sale of marijuana and marijuana products. Under the new law, home cultivation and personal possession of marijuana became legal July 1, 2021, but retail sales will not begin until January 1, 2024. In 2022 and 2023, the Virginia General Assembly passed and Governor Glenn Youngkin signed into law a series of statutory amendments to the adult use cannabis legislation and affecting the medical cannabis program. Among other things, the amendments transfer oversight and administration of the medical cannabis program from the Board of Pharmacy to the Virginia Cannabis Control Authority, establish new restrictions on advertising, with criminal penalties for violations,, allows pharmacists employed by pharmaceutical processors to issue written certifications subject to oversight by the processor s medical director and under other conditions, adds labeling requirements, and recriminalizes possession of more than four (4) ounces of cannabis in public. 
 Columbia Care (through its subsidiaries in the Commonwealth of Virginia) follows the regulatory framework enacted by the Commonwealth of Virginia. 
 Virginia License Requirements 
 The pharmaceutical processor permit application process includes three stages: initial application, awarding of conditional approval, and granting of a permit. In the first stage, the applicant must submit an application fee and an application that includes: identifying information regarding the applicant and its owners; the location within the health service area that is to be operated under such permit; financial information to demonstrate its capacity to build and operate a facility; a detailed security plan; documents establishing the applicant s ability to conduct business in Virginia and its compliance with applicable ordinances and codes; information necessary for the Virginia Board to conduct criminal background checks; information about any previous or current involvement in the medical CBD oil or THC-A oil industry; information about any prior applications for medical CBD oil or THC-A oil licensure in any state; business or marketing plans; text and graphic materials showing the exterior appearance of the proposed facility; building documents including a detailed blueprint; documents related to any compassionate need program the pharmaceutical processor intends to offer; information about the applicant s expertise in agriculture and other production techniques required to produce CBD oil or THC-A oil and to safely dispense such products; and other documents required by the Virginia Board. As part of the initial application process, the Virginia Board conducts criminal background checks on applicants. 
 Following the deadline for receipt of applications, the Virginia Board evaluates each complete and timely submitted application and may grant conditional approval based on the following criteria: the results of the criminal background checks or any history of disciplinary action imposed by a state or federal regulatory agency; the location for the proposed pharmaceutical processor, which shall not be within 1,000 feet of a school or daycare; the applicant s ability to maintain adequate control against the diversion, theft, and loss of cannabis; the applicant s ability to maintain the knowledge, understanding, judgment, procedures, security controls, and ethics to ensure optimal safety and accuracy in the dispensing and sale of CBD oil or THC-A oil; the extent to which the applicant or any of its the applicant s pharmaceutical processor owners have a financial interest in another license, permit, registrant, or applicant; and any other reason provided by state or federal statute or regulation that is not inconsistent with the law and regulations regarding pharmaceutical processors. The Virginia Board may disqualify any applicant who submits an incomplete, false, inaccurate, or misleading application; fails to submit an application by the published deadline; fails to pay all applicable fees; or fails to comply with all requirements for a pharmaceutical processor. 
 Following review, the Virginia Board notifies applicants of denial or conditional approval. If granted conditional approval, an applicant has one year to complete all requirements for issuance of a permit to include employment of a Pharmacist-in-Charge PIC and other personnel necessary for operation of a pharmaceutical processor, the construction or remodeling of a facility, installation of equipment, and securing local zoning approval. 
 When the Virginia Board s requirements have been met including designation of a PIC, completion of background checks, employment of an electronic tracking system, and an inspection of the facility the Virginia Board may grant a pharmaceutical processor permit. If an inspection reveals any deficiencies, they must be corrected, and a reinspection may be performed before the permit is issued. The applicant must also attest to compliance with state and local laws and ordinances. 
 If an applicant has been awarded a pharmaceutical processor permit and has not commenced operation of such facility within 180 days of being notified of the issuance of a pharmaceutical processor permit, the Virginia Board may rescind the permit, unless such delay was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the permit holder. If a permit is so rescinded, the Virginia Board may award a 
 73 

pharmaceutical processor permit to another qualified applicant. Once the permit is issued, cannabis may not be grown or held in the pharmaceutical processor earlier than two weeks prior to the opening date designated on the application. Once cannabis has been placed in the pharmaceutical processor, a pharmacist shall be present during hours of operation to ensure the safety, security, and integrity of the cannabis. If there is a change in the designated opening date, the pharmaceutical processor shall notify the Virginia Board, and a pharmacist shall continue to be on site on a daily basis. 
 The Virginia Board may issue up to five cannabis dispensing facility permits in each health service area. A permit may be issued to a facility that is owned, at least in part, by the pharmaceutical processor located in that health service area for dispensing cannabis oil that has been cultivated and produced on the premises of the processor. Each dispensing facility shall be located within the same health service area as the pharmaceutical processor. 
 Applicants must submit an application and fee for each cannabis dispensing facility. The submission must also include (i) the name and address of the facility, (ii) the name and address of the facility s owners with 5 or greater ownership, (iii) the name and signature of pharmacist-in-charge, (iv) details regarding the security plan and plan to prevent diversion, (v) information for the Virginia Board to conduct a background check, and (vi) the requisite fee. 
 The Virginia Board will conduct an inspection of the facility prior to issuing a permit. The permit shall not be awarded until any deficiency with the facility has been corrected and the facility has been satisfactorily inspected. The cannabis dispensing facility must be operational within 90 days of the date the permit is issued or the Virginia Board will either rescind or extend the permit. 
 Virginia Operating Requirements 
 Pharmaceutical processors and cannabis dispensing facilities are required to designate a PIC to manage its operation, and to have a supervising pharmacist on duty during its hours of operation. The PIC of a pharmaceutical processor may authorize certain employees access to secured areas designated for cultivation even when the pharmacist is not on the premises. Numerous tasks involving the handling of CBD oil or THC-A oil must be performed by a pharmacist or a pharmacy technician acting under a pharmacist s supervision. Those tasks include, for example, labeling oils, removing oils from inventory, measuring oils for dispensing, and selling oils. Pharmacists and pharmacy technicians must have current licenses, and the ratio of pharmacists to pharmacy technicians cannot exceed 4-to-1. The Virginia Board has also imposed certain educational requirements for the cultivation of cannabis plants and the extraction of oils. And, the Virginia Board requires significant employee training, both upon initial employment and continuously thereafter. 
 A pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility must operate for a minimum of 35 hours per week. Access to a pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility is limited to employees performing their job duties (who must display ID badges) and patients (and their parents or guardians). It must sell oils in a child-resistant container (with some exceptions). Pharmacists must counsel registered patients, parents, and legal guardians regarding the use of CBD oil or THC-A oil, including information related proper use and storage. 
 Pharmaceutical processors and cannabis dispensing facilities are subject to advertising restrictions; cannot sell products aside from CBD oil or THC-A oil; cannot cultivate, produce, or dispense oils anywhere except its designated facility; and cannot provide samples. Pharmaceutical processors and cannabis dispensing facilities may wholesale products to other pharmaceutical processors and may transport wholesale products to other pharmaceutical processors and cannabis dispensing facilities. A pharmaceutical processor wholesale distributing products must create a record of the transaction and provide the receiver of the products with a copy of the lab results for the product. They may also deliver CBD or THC-A oil to a registered patient in accordance with certain regulatory requirements. 
 The cultivation and dispensing processes are subject to numerous Virginia Board requirements. For cultivation: pesticides are prohibited (with some exception); oil extraction methods must meet industry standards; products must be branded, tested, and registered with the Virginia Board before they are dispensed; products must be labeled to disclose certain product identifying information; and samples from batches must be made available to independent laboratories for testing prior to sale. For dispensing: the pharmacist or pharmacy technician must view the patient s ID before filling any portion of the patient s prescription; the pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility must maintain detailed dispensing records for three years; and the processor or dispensing must implement and comply with a quality assurance program, meeting several requirements, to prevent dispensing errors. Finally, unused cannabis and its oils must be disposed of in a manner that makes the cannabis and its oils unrecoverable. 
 As of March 2023, the Board allows pharmaceutical processors to sell whole flower to patients.

 WASHINGTON, D.C. 
 Washington, D.C. Regulatory Landscape 
 Washington, D.C. s medical cannabis program is governed by D.C. Code 7-1671.01 et seq. and the implementing regulations, CDCR 22-C100 et seq. The program authorizes all registered, qualified patients and caregivers to purchase medical cannabis from any licensed dispensary in the District. Registrations cards for District residents are valid for two years from the date of issuance. The program also authorizes medical cannabis cardholders from other states to purchase medical cannabis from any licensed dispensary in the District. The program accepts medical cannabis cards from any state or U.S. territory that has an active medical cannabis program and issues either a card or state-issued document evidencing the patient s participation in the program as long as that state or territory extends reciprocity to the District. The program also allows non-District residents to apply for a 30-day temporary registration. 
 The medical cannabis program creates licensing regimes for dispensaries and cultivation centers. A dispensary registered to operate in the District of Columbia may (a) possess and sell medical cannabis to registered qualified patients and caregivers; and (b) manufacture, purchase, possess, and distribute paraphernalia and cigarette rolling papers to registered qualified patients and

A cultivation center registered to operate in the District of Columbia may: (a) possess, manufacture, grow, cultivate, and distribute medical cannabis for sale to registered dispensaries; and (b) manufacture, purchase, possess, and distribute paraphernalia and cigarette rolling papers to registered dispensaries. The number of dispensaries in the District of Columbia is capped at 8, while the number of cultivation centers is capped at 14. Currently, there are seven operating dispensaries and six operating cultivation centers. An application processes for an additional dispensary license, two additional cultivation centers, and two testing laboratories was completed on September 28, 2022. 
 
 On January 30, 2023, the Mayor of Washington, D.C. signed the Medical Cannabis Amendment Act of 2022 that includes substantial changes to the medical cannabis program, including removing the caps on licenses, establishing a process for unlicensed establishment to obtain a medical cannabis business license, creating new license categories and endorsement, allowing qualifying patients to self-certify and creating a civil enforcement mechanism for businesses distributing or selling cannabis without a license. The Act is currently being reviewed by Congress. According to the D.C. City Council, the Projected Law Date is Mar 28, 2023 unless Congress passes a Resolution of Disapproval.

 WEST VIRGINIA (HEMP) 
 In 2002, the West Virginia Legislature passed the Industrial Hemp Development Act (the WV Hemp Act ), which created the framework for legalized industrial hemp in West Virginia. Following passage of the 2014 Farm Bill, which authorized states to establish pilot programs for industrial hemp research, the West Virginia Department of Agriculture implemented a pilot program based on the authority already granted by the WV Hemp Act. From 2017 to 2019, the number of license-holders under the pilot program increased from 46 to 165. West Virginia s 2019 amendments to the WV Hemp Act authorized the Commissioner of Agriculture to submit a state plan for regulation of industrial hemp to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for approval pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill. The West Virginia Department of Agriculture submitted such a plan on January 23, 2020, with a proposed effective date of October 31, 2020. The plan proposed to the U.S. Department of Agriculture is consistent with the West Virginia Department of Agriculture s existing industrial hemp program. 
 The industry hemp program subjects licensees to several regulatory requirements. These include crop-testing requirements to determine whether the hemp has a permissible THC level of under 0.3 ; recordkeeping and reporting requirements; and submission to any inspection and sampling that the West Virginia Department of Agriculture deems necessary. Intentional violations of the WV Hemp Act and the West Virginia Department of Agriculture s rules, as well as repeated negligent violations, may result in a loss of license. 
 77 

Columbia Care s subsidiary, Columbia Care WV Industrial Hemp LLC, applied for and was granted a license to develop an industrial hemp farm in West Virginia. The license authorizes Columbia Care to grow, process, cultivate, store, and handle raw industrial hemp. 
 WEST VIRGINIA 
 Regulatory Landscape 
 Senate Bill 386, signed into law on April 19, 2017, by Governor Jim Justice, created the Medical Cannabis Act that allows for cannabis to be used for certified medical use by a West Virginia resident with a serious medical condition and is limited to the following forms: pill; oil; topical forms including gels, creams or ointments; a form medically appropriate for administration by vaporization or nebulization, dry leaf or plant form; tincture; liquid; or dermal patch. The medical cannabis program is administered by the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health, Office of Medical Cannabis (the WV Bureau ). The Office has authority to (1) issue and oversee permits that authorize businesses to grow, process, or dispense medical cannabis in compliance with state law and regulations, (2) register medical practitioners who certify patients as having qualifying serious medical conditions, and (3) register and oversee patients with qualifying conditions. Medical cannabis may only be dispensed to a patient who receives a certification from a practitioner and is in possession of a valid identification card issued by the WV Bureau ; and a caregiver who is in possession of a valid identification card issued by the Bureau. Products packaged by a grower/processor or sold by a dispensary shall only be identified by the name of the grower/processor, the name of the dispensary, the form and species of medical cannabis, the percentage of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol contained in the product. 
 
 A dispensary that has been issued a permit may lawfully dispense medical cannabis to a patient or caregiver upon presentation to the dispensary of a valid identification card for that patient or caregiver. The dispensary shall provide to the patient or caregiver a receipt, as appropriate. The receipt shall include all of the following: the name, address, and any identification number assigned to the dispensary by the WV Bureau; the name and address of the patient and caregiver; the date the medical cannabis was dispensed; any requirement or limitation by the practitioner as to the form of medical cannabis for the patient; and the form and the quantity of medical cannabis dispensed. Dispensaries are prohibited from dispensing cannabis products to anyone other than a registered patient or caregiver who presents a valid identification card from the Office. Dispensing amounts are limited to those indicated in a registered patient s certification by his/her medical practitioner, and in any event a dispensary may not dispense more than a 30-day supply at a given time. 
 The WV Bureau and the Department of Revenue must monitor the price of medical cannabis sold by growers, processors and by dispensaries, including a per-dose price. If the WV Bureau and the Department of Revenue determine that the prices are unreasonable or excessive, the WV Bureau may implement a cap on the price of medical cannabis being sold for a period of six months. 
 The WV Bureau s Office of Medical Cannabis (the WV Office received applications for medical cannabis growers, processors, dispensaries, and laboratories in Spring 2020. The Office of Medical Cannabis issued 10 grower permits on October 3, 2020. It issued 10 processor permits on November 13, 2020. It issued 100 dispensary permits on January 29, 2021, and announced that, beginning February 3, 2021, West Virginia residents with serious medical conditions would be able to begin to submit applications to become registered patients. 
 Permits issued by the Office of Medical Cannabis are effective for one year from the date of issuance and may be renewed by applicants in good standing with the terms of a currently-effective permit. Permits may be suspended or revoked on the basis of failure to prevent diversion of medical cannabis, or violation of laws and rules applicable to medical cannabis businesses.

Reporting Requirements 
 A medical cannabis organization must implement an electronic inventory tracking system which shall be directly accessible to the WV Bureau through its electronic database that electronically tracks all medical cannabis on a daily basis. The system shall include tracking of all of the following: for a grower or processor, a seed-to-sale tracking system that tracks the medical cannabis from seed to plant until the medical cannabis is sold to a dispensary; for a dispensary, medical cannabis from purchase from the grower/processor to sale to a patient or caregiver and that includes information that verifies the validity of an identification card presented by the patient or caregiver; for a medical cannabis organization, a daily log of each day s beginning inventory, acquisitions, amounts purchased and sold, disbursements, disposals and ending inventory. 
 Inspections 
 The Office is permitted to conduct announced or unannounced inspections of permittees to determine their compliance with West Virginia law and regulations, and may inspect a permittee s site, records, and other data, and may interview employees, principals, operators, and financial backers of the permittee. The Office will have free access to review and, if necessary, make copies of books, records, papers, documents, data, or other physical or electronic information that relates to the business of the medical cannabis organization, including financial data, sales data, shipping data, pricing data, and employee data. The Office will have free access to any area within a site or facility that is being used to store medical cannabis for testing purposes and are permitted to collect test samples for testing at an approved laboratory. 
 Security, Transportation, and Storage Requirements 
 Permittees must have security and surveillance systems, utilizing commercial-grade equipment, to prevent unauthorized entry and to prevent and detect an adverse loss. The security systems must incorporate a professionally monitored security alarm system that is operational 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and records all activity in images capable of clearly revealing facial detail; have the ability to clearly and accurately display the date and time; record all images captured by each surveillance camera for a minimum of 180 days in a format that may be easily accessed for investigative purposes; and utilize a security alarm system separate from the facility s primary security system covering the limited access area or other room where the recordings are stored. Permittees must install commercial-grade, nonresidential doors and door locks on each external door of the facility, with keys or key codes for all doors remaining in the possession of designated authorized individuals. During all nonworking hours, all entrances to and exits from the site and facility must be securely locked. Permittees must install lighting to ensure proper surveillance both inside and outside of the facility. Access to rooms containing security and surveillance monitoring equipment must be limited to persons who are essential to maintaining security and surveillance operations; federal, state and local law enforcement; security and surveillance system service employees; the bureau or its authorized agents; and other persons with the prior written approval of the Office. 
 
 A permittee is permitted to transport and deliver medical cannabis to a medical cannabis organization or an approved laboratory. A grower/processor may deliver medical cannabis to a medical cannabis organization or an approved laboratory only between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. A grower/processor may contract with a third-party contractor for delivery so long as the contractor complies with the Office s rules and regulations. A grower/processor must use a global positioning system to ensure safe, efficient delivery of the medical cannabis to a medical cannabis organization or an approved laboratory. Vehicles permitted to transport medical cannabis must be equipped with a secure lockbox or locking cargo area, have no markings that would either identify or indicate that the vehicle is being used to transport medical cannabis, be capable of being temperature-controlled for perishable medical cannabis, as appropriate, display current state inspection stickers and maintain a current state vehicle registration, and be insured in an amount that is commercially reasonable and appropriate. Medical cannabis stored inside the transport vehicle may not be visible from the outside of 
 79 

the transport vehicle. A transport vehicle is subject to inspection by the bureau or its authorized agents, law enforcement, or other federal or state officials if necessary, to perform the government officials functions and duties. Available Information

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the sections titled Forward-Looking Statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects and could cause the trading price of shares of our common shares to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. 
 Risks Related to the Arrangement 
 There can be no assurance that all of the conditions precedent to closing of the Arrangement will be satisfied. 
 The completion of the Arrangement is subject to a number of conditions precedent, some of which are outside of Columbia Care s control, including receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals (the Key Regulatory Approvals ). 
 In addition, the completion of the Arrangement by Columbia Care and Cresco is conditional on, among other things, no material adverse effect having occurred or having been disclosed to the public (if previously undisclosed to the public) in respect of the other Party. 
 There can be no certainty, nor can Columbia Care and Cresco provide any assurance, that all conditions precedent to the Arrangement will be satisfied or waived, or, if satisfied or waived, when they will be satisfied or waived and, accordingly, the Arrangement may not be completed. If the Arrangement is not completed, the market price of the Common Shares may be adversely affected. 
 The Key Regulatory Approvals may not be obtained or, if obtained, may not be obtained on a favorable basis. 
 To complete the Arrangement, each of Columbia Care and Cresco must make certain filings with and obtain certain consents and approvals from various governmental and regulatory authorities, including certain state cannabis regulators. The Key Regulatory Approvals have not yet been obtained and in some cases will be dependent on the successful divestiture of certain of Columbia Care s and Cresco s assets (the Divestitures ). The regulatory approval processes and the Divestitures may take a lengthy period of time to complete, which could delay completion of the Arrangement. If obtained, the Key Regulatory Approvals may be conditioned, with the conditions imposed by the applicable governmental entity not being acceptable to either Columbia Care or Cresco, or, if acceptable, not being on terms that are favorable to the resulting combined company (the Combined Company ). There can be no assurance as to the outcome of the regulatory approval processes, including the undertakings and conditions that may be required for approval or whether the Key Regulatory Approvals will be obtained. If not obtained, or if obtained on terms that are not satisfactory to either Columbia Care or Cresco, the Arrangement may not be completed. 
 
 Columbia Care and Cresco may not be able to complete the Divestitures, or if completed, may not be completed on a favorable basis. 
 
 Obtaining the Key Regulatory Approvals will, in some cases, be dependent on the completion of the Divestitures. There can be no assurance that Columbia Care and Cresco will be able to complete the Divestitures on terms acceptable to Columbia Care and/or Cresco or at all. If all of the Divestitures are not completed and the conditions to the completion of the Arrangement are not waived or satisfied, the Arrangement may not be consummated and any Divestiture that may have otherwise been completed in connection with the Arrangement could have an adverse effect on the businesses of Columbia Care and Cresco. 
 80 

If the Arrangement is not completed, the market price of the Common Shares may be adversely affected. 
 If, for any reason, the Arrangement is not completed or its completion is materially delayed and/or the Arrangement Agreement is terminated, the market price of the Common Shares may be materially adversely affected. Depending on the reasons for terminating the Arrangement Agreement, Columbia Care s business, financial condition or results of operations could also be subject to various material adverse consequences, including as a result of paying a termination fee of 65 million (the Columbia Care Termination Fee ). 
 There can be no assurance that the Arrangement Agreement will not be terminated by Columbia Care or Cresco in certain circumstances. 
 
 Each of Columbia Care and Cresco has the right, in certain circumstances, in addition to termination rights relating to the failure to satisfy the conditions of closing, to terminate the Arrangement Agreement. Accordingly, there can be no certainty, nor can Columbia Care provide any assurance that the Arrangement will not be terminated by either of Columbia Care or Cresco prior to the completion of the Arrangement. The Arrangement Agreement also contemplates the payment of the Columbia Care Termination Fee if the if the Arrangement Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances. Additionally, any termination will result in the failure to realize the expected benefits of the Arrangement in respect of the operations and business of Columbia Care and Cresco. 
 
 The Columbia Care Termination Fee may discourage other parties from attempting to acquire Columbia Care or Cresco. 
 Under the Arrangement Agreement, in the event the Arrangement Agreement is terminated in connection with entry into a superior proposal, Columbia Care may be required to pay the Termination Fee. The Columbia Care Termination Fee may discourage other parties from attempting to acquire Common Shares or otherwise make any acquisition proposal to Columbia Care, even if those parties would otherwise be willing to offer greater value to Columbia Care shareholders than that offered by Cresco under the Arrangement. 
 The uncertainty surrounding the Arrangement could negatively impact Columbia Care s or Cresco's current and future operations, financial condition and prospects. 
 As the Arrangement is dependent upon receipt of, among other things, the Key Regulatory Approvals and satisfaction of certain other conditions, its completion is uncertain. If the Arrangement is not completed for any reason, there are risks that the announcement of the Arrangement and the dedication of Columbia Care s resources to the completion thereof could have a negative impact on its relationships with its stakeholders and could negatively impact current and future operations, financial condition and prospects of Columbia Care. Similarly, there are risks that the announcement of the Arrangement and the dedication of Cresco s resources to the completion thereof could have a negative impact on its relationships with its stakeholders and could negatively impact current and future operations, financial condition and prospects of Cresco, both prior to or following the completion of the Arrangement. 
 In addition, Columbia Care has, and will continue to, incur significant transaction expenses in connection with the Arrangement, regardless of whether the Arrangement is completed. 
 Restrictions during the pending Arrangement that prevent Columbia Care from pursuing business opportunities could have an adverse effect on Columbia Care. 
 Each of Columbia Care and Cresco is subject to customary non-solicitation provisions under the Arrangement Agreement, pursuant to which, the Parties are restricted from soliciting, initiating or knowingly encouraging any acquisition proposal, among other things. The Arrangement Agreement also restricts them from taking specified actions until the Arrangement is completed without the consent of the other Party. These restrictions may prevent Columbia Care or Cresco from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Arrangement and could have an adverse effect on the business, operating results or prospects of Columbia Care. 
 There can be no assurance that the value of the Cresco Labs Subordinate Voting Shares received by Columbia Care shareholders will equal or exceed the value of the Common Shares prior to the Effective Date. 
 The Exchange Ratio will not increase or decrease due to fluctuations in the market price of the Common Shares or Cresco Labs Subordinate Voting Shares; provided, the Exchange Ratio may potentially be adjusted in the event that Columbia Care is required to issue shares in satisfaction of an earn-out payment for the Green Leaf Medical acquisition, with the potential adjustment in proportion to the additional dilution from such potential issuance relative to Columbia Care s current fully diluted in-the money outstanding shares. The market price of the Common Shares or Cresco Labs Subordinate Voting Shares could each fluctuate significantly prior to the effective date of the Arrangement (the Effective Date in response to various factors and events, including, without limitation, as a result of the differences between Columbia Care s and Cresco's actual financial or operating results and those expected by 
 81 

investors and analysts, changes in analysts projections or recommendations, changes in general economic or market conditions, and broad market fluctuations. As a result of such fluctuations, historical market prices are not indicative of future market prices or the market value of the Cresco Labs Subordinate Voting Shares that holders of Common Shares will receive on the Effective Date. There can be no assurance that the market value of the Cresco Labs Subordinate Voting Shares that the holders of Common Shares will receive on the Effective Date will equal or exceed the market value of the Common Shares held by such Columbia Care shareholders prior to the Effective Date. Similarly, there can be no assurance that the trading price of Cresco Labs Subordinate Voting Shares will not decline following the completion of the Arrangement. 
 The foregoing risks or other risks arising in connection with the failure of the Arrangement, including the diversion of management s attention from conducting the business of Columbia Care, may negatively impact Columbia Care s business operations, financial results and share price. 
 Potential payments to Columbia Care shareholders who exercise dissent rights could have an adverse effect on the Combined Company s financial condition or prevent the completion of the Arrangement. 
 Registered Columbia Care shareholders as at May 10, 2022 have the right to exercise dissent rights and demand payment equal to the fair value of their Common Shares. If dissent rights are exercised in respect of a significant number of Common Shares, a substantial payment may be required to be made to such Columbia Care shareholders, which could have an adverse effect on the Combined Company s financial condition and cash resources. Further, Cresco's obligation to complete the Arrangement is conditional upon Columbia Care shareholders holding no more than 5 of the outstanding Common Shares having exercised dissent rights. Accordingly, the Arrangement may not be completed if Columbia Care shareholders exercise dissent rights in respect of more than 5 of the outstanding Columbia Care Shares. 
 Another attractive take-over, merger or business combination may not be available if the Arrangement is not completed. 
 If the Arrangement is not completed and is terminated, there can be no assurance that Columbia Care will be able to find a party willing to pay equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration to be provided by Cresco under the Arrangement or be willing to proceed at all with a similar transaction or any alternative transaction. 
 Columbia Care will incur costs even if the Arrangement is not completed and may have to pay the Columbia Care Termination Fee. 
 Certain costs related to the Arrangement, such as legal, accounting and certain financial advisor fees, must be paid by Columbia Care even if the Arrangement is not completed. There is no assurance that Columbia Care will have the funds to pay these costs which would adversely affect the share price of the Common Shares. If the Arrangement Agreement is terminated, Columbia Care may be required in certain circumstances to pay Cresco the Columbia Care Termination Fee. 
 Following completion of the Arrangement, former Columbia Care shareholders will not have the ability to significantly influence certain corporate actions of Cresco. 
 Immediately following the completion of the Arrangement, former Columbia Care shareholders are expected to own approximately 35 of the pro forma Cresco Labs Subordinate Voting Shares (on a fully diluted in-the-money, treasury method basis), based on the number of Columbia Care Shares outstanding upon completion of the Arrangement and assuming that (i) there are no dissenting Columbia Care shareholders, (ii) there are no Columbia Care Options exercised prior to the Effective Time, (iii) there are no Columbia Care Convertible Notes converted prior to the Effective Time, and (iv) there are no Columbia Care Warrants exercised prior to the Effective Time. Former Columbia Care shareholders (other than any dissenting Columbia Care shareholders) will not be in a position to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, determination of significant corporate actions, amendments to Cresco's articles of incorporation and the approval of any business combinations, mergers or takeover attempts. 
 We may experience difficulties integrating Columbia Care and Cresco s operations and realizing the expected benefits of the Arrangement. 
 The success of the Arrangement will depend in part on our ability to realize the expected operational efficiencies and associated cost synergies and anticipated business opportunities and growth prospects from combining Columbia Care and Cresco in an efficient and effective manner. We may not be able to fully realize the operational efficiencies and associated cost synergies or leverage the potential business opportunities and growth prospects to the extent anticipated or at all. 
 82 

Challenges associated with the integration may include those related to retaining and motivating executives and other key employees, blending corporate cultures, eliminating duplicative operations, and making necessary modifications to internal control over financial reporting and other policies and procedures in accordance with applicable laws. Some of these factors are outside our control, and any of them could delay or increase the cost of our integration efforts. 
 The integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business, increased tax costs, inefficiencies, and inconsistencies in standards, controls, information technology systems, policies and procedures, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with employees, customers or other third parties, or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction, and could harm our financial performance. If we are unable to successfully integrate certain aspects of the operations of Columbia Care and Cresco or experience delays, we may incur unanticipated liabilities and expenses, and be unable to fully realize the potential benefit of the revenue growth, synergies and other anticipated benefits resulting from the Arrangement, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 We incurred, and may continue to incur, significant Arrangement-related costs and integration costs in connection with the Arrangement with Cresco. 
 We incurred, and may continue to incur, significant Arrangement-related costs and integration costs in connection with the Arrangement with Cresco. We may incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees. Unanticipated costs may be incurred in the course of integration, and management cannot ensure that the elimination of duplicative costs or the realization of other efficiencies will offset the transaction and integration costs in the near term or at all. 
 
 The pending Arrangement may divert the attention of Columbia Care s management. 
 The pending Arrangement could cause the attention of Columbia Care s management to be diverted from the day-to-day operations. These disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the Arrangement and could have an adverse effect on the business, operating results or prospects of Columbia Care regardless of whether the Arrangement is ultimately completed. 
 
 Cresco may issue additional equity securities. 
 Following, or prior to, the completion of the Arrangement, Cresco may issue equity securities to finance its activities, including in order to finance acquisitions. If Cresco were to issue additional equity securities, the ownership interest of existing Cresco shareholders may be diluted and some or all of Cresco financial measures on a per share basis could be reduced. Moreover, as Cresco s intention to issue additional equity securities becomes publicly known, its share price may be materially adversely affected. 
 
 Tax consequences of the Arrangement may differ from anticipated treatment, including if the Arrangement does not qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code Section 368(a) ), U.S. Holders may be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes. 
 
 There can be no assurance that the Canada Revenue Agency, the IRS or other applicable taxing authorities will agree with the Canadian and U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Arrangement, as applicable. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that applicable Canadian and U.S. income tax laws, regulations or tax treaties or conventions will not change (legislatively, judicially or otherwise and potentially with retroactive effect) or be interpreted in a manner, or that applicable taxing authorities will not take an administrative position, that is adverse to Columbia Care, Cresco and their respective shareholders (in each case, including any successor thereto) following completion of the Arrangement. Taxation authorities may also disagree with how Columbia Care and Cresco following the Arrangement calculate or have in the past calculated their income or other amounts for tax purposes. Any such events could adversely affect Cresco following the Arrangement, its share price or the dividends that may be paid to Cresco s shareholders following completion of the Arrangement. 
 
 The Arrangement is intended to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a), and Columbia Care and Cresco intend to report the Arrangement consistent with such qualification. If the IRS or a court determines that the Arrangement should not be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a), a U.S. holder of Columbia Care Shares would generally recognize taxable gain or loss upon the exchange of Columbia Care Shares for Cresco Labs Subordinate Voting Shares pursuant to the Arrangement. 
 
 Columbia Care s convertible notes, first-lien notes and warrants may cease to be qualified investments for Registered Plans. 
 
 As a result of the Arrangement, Columbia Care s convertible notes, first-lien notes and warrants may cease to be qualified investments under the Income Tax Act (Canada) and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the Tax Act for trusts governed by a RRSP, RRIF, RESP, RDSP, TFSA or deferred profit sharing plan (each, a Registered Plan and adverse tax consequences may arise as a 
 83 

result. The tax considerations applicable to holders of Columbia Care Notes or Columbia Care Warrants are not described herein. Any holder of Columbia Care Notes or Columbia Care Warrants to which this may apply should consult with and rely upon their own tax advisors to discuss the tax consequences to them of the Arrangement. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Business 
 Marijuana remains illegal under federal law, and enforcement of cannabis laws could change. Columbia Care both directly and indirectly engages in the cannabis industry in the United States where local and state laws permit such activities. Investors are cautioned that in the United States, cannabis is largely regulated at the state level. To Columbia Care s knowledge, as of December 31, 2022, 37 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands have passed laws broadly legalizing marijuana for medicinal use by eligible patients. In the District of Columbia, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam and 21 of these states, marijuana has been legalized for adult use, although not all of those jurisdictions have fully implemented their legalization programs. These include the states and territories in which Columbia Care operates. Notwithstanding the permissive regulatory environment of cannabis at the state level, cannabis continues to be categorized as a Schedule 1 controlled substance under the CSA and as such, cultivation, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis violates federal law in the United States. The inconsistency between federal and state laws and regulations is a major risk factor. 
 Federal prosecutors are free to utilize their prosecutorial discretion to decide whether to prosecute cannabis activities despite the existence of state-level laws that may be inconsistent with federal prohibitions. No direction was given to federal prosecutors under the previous U.S. presidential administration as to the priority they should ascribe to such cannabis activities, and resultantly it is uncertain how active federal prosecutors will be in relation to such activities It is not yet known whether the Department of Justice under President Biden and Attorney General Garland will re- adopt the Cole Memo or announce a substantive marijuana enforcement policy. Attorney General Garland stated at a confirmation hearing before the United States Senate that It does not seem to me a useful use of limited resources that we have, to be pursuing prosecutions in states that have legalized and that are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise. I don t think that s a useful use. 1 Garland reiterated this view at a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing on April 26, 2022. When asked by Senator Brian Schatz whether he intended to reissue guidance encouraging federal prosecutors to use discretion in marijuana cases in states that have legalized. I laid this out in my confirmation hearing, and my view hasn t really changed since then, Garland replied. The Justice Department has almost never prosecuted use of marijuana, and it s not going to be. 2 Marijuana prosecutions are not an efficient use of the resources given the opioid and methamphetamine epidemic that we have, he said. However, Garland declined to comment on whether the Department of Justice intended to formally re-adopt the Cole Memo. Recently, in testimony in February of 2023 before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Garland said the DOJ is still working on a marijuana policy and that policy when issued will be very close to what was done in the Cole Memorandum. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that the federal government will not seek to prosecute cases involving cannabis businesses that are otherwise compliant with state law. Federal law is separate from state law in these circumstances; therefore, the federal government can assert criminal violations of federal law despite state law. If the current administration was to aggressively pursue financiers or equity owners of cannabis-related businesses, and United States Attorneys followed such Department of Justice policies through pursuing prosecutions, then Columbia Care could face (i) seizure of its cash and other assets used to support or derived from its cannabis subsidiaries; and (ii) the arrest of its employees, directors, officers, managers and investors, who could face charges of ancillary criminal violations of the CSA for aiding and abetting and conspiring to violate the CSA by virtue of providing financial support to state-licensed or permitted cultivators, processors, distributors, and/or retailers of cannabis. 
 The Department of Justice under the current administration or an aggressive federal prosecutor could allege that Columbia Care and the Board and, potentially its shareholders, aided and abetted violations of federal law by providing finances and services to its operating subsidiaries. Under these circumstances, it is possible that the federal prosecutor would seek to seize the assets of Columbia Care, and to recover the illicit profits previously distributed to shareholders resulting from any of the foregoing financing or services. In these circumstances, Columbia Care s operations would cease, Columbia Care securityholders may lose their entire investment and directors, officers and/or Columbia Care Shareholders may be left to defend any criminal charges against them at their own expense and, if convicted, be sent to federal prison. Violations of any federal laws could result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions or settlements arising from civil proceedings conducted by either the federal government or private citizens, or criminal charges, including, but not limited to, disgorgement of profits, cessation of business activities or divestiture. This could have a material adverse effect on Columbia Care, including its reputation and ability to conduct business, its holding (directly or indirectly) of cannabis licenses in the United States, the listing of its securities on the Exchanges or other applicable exchanges, its financial position, operating results, profitability or liquidity or the market price of its listed securities. Overall, an investor s contribution to and involvement in Columbia Care s activities may result in federal civil and/or criminal prosecution, including forfeiture of his, her or its entire investment. 
 84 

There is no guarantee that the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment will be renewed. The Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment has been adopted by U.S. Congress in successive budgets since 2015. The Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment prohibits the Department of Justice from spending funds appropriated by Congress to enforce the tenets of the CSA against the medical cannabis industry in states which have legalized such activity. This amendment has historically been passed as an amendment to omnibus appropriations bills, which by their nature expire at the end of a fiscal year or other defined term. The Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment was renewed most recently through September 23, 2023. Notably, Rohrabacher-Farr has applied only to medical marijuana programs and has not provided the same protections to enforcement against adult-use activities. There is no guarantee that the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment will be included in future legislation. 
 There is a risk of civil asset forfeiture of the Company s assets. 
 Since the cannabis industry remains illegal under U.S. federal law, any property owned by participants in the cannabis industry which are either used in the course of conducting such business, or are the proceeds of such business, could be subject to seizure by law enforcement and subsequent civil asset forfeiture. Even if the owner of the property was never charged with a crime, the property in question could still be seized and subject to an administrative proceeding by which, with minimal due process, it could be subject to forfeiture. 
 The Company is subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations. 
 Columbia Care is subject to a variety of laws and regulations domestically and in the United States that involve money laundering, financial recordkeeping and proceeds of crime, including the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act), Sections 1956 and 1957 of U.S.C. Title 18 (the Money Laundering Control Act), the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (Canada), as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder, the Criminal Code (Canada) and any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines, issued, administered or enforced by governmental authorities in the United States and Canada. Banks often refuse to provide banking services to businesses involved in the U.S. cannabis industry due to the present state of the laws and regulations governing financial institutions in the United States. The lack of banking and financial services presents unique and significant challenges to businesses in the medical cannabis industry. The potential lack of a secure place in which to deposit and store cash, the inability to pay creditors through the issuance of checks and the inability to secure traditional forms of operational financing, such as lines of credit, are some of the many challenges presented by the unavailability of traditional banking and financial services. 
 In February 2014, FinCEN, a division of the U.S. Department of Treasury, issued the FinCEN Guidance, providing instructions to banks seeking to provide services to cannabis-related businesses. The FinCEN Guidance states that in some circumstances, it is permissible for banks to provide services to cannabis-related businesses without risking prosecution for violation of federal money laundering laws. It refers to supplementary guidance that former Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole issued to federal prosecutors relating to the prosecution of money laundering offenses predicated on cannabis-related violations of the CSA. While the FinCEN Guidance has not been rescinded by the Department of Justice at this time, it remains unclear whether the current administration will follow its guidelines. Overall, the Department of Justice continues to have the right and power to prosecute crimes committed by banks and financial institutions, such as money laundering and violations of the Bank Secrecy Act that occur in any state, including in states that have legalized the applicable conduct, and the Department of Justice s current enforcement priorities could change for any number of reasons, including a change in the opinions of the President of the United States or the United States Attorney General. A change in the Department of Justice s enforcement priorities could result in the Department of Justice prosecuting banks and financial institutions for crimes that previously were not prosecuted. 
 In the event that any of Columbia Care s operations, or any proceeds thereof, any dividends or distributions therefrom, or any profits or revenues accruing from such operations in the United States were found to be in violation of money laundering legislation or otherwise, such transactions may be viewed as proceeds of crime under one or more of the statutes noted above or any other applicable legislation. This could restrict or otherwise jeopardize the ability of Columbia Care to declare or pay dividends, effect other distributions or subsequently repatriate such funds back to Canada. Furthermore, while there are no current intentions to declare or pay dividends on the Common Shares in the foreseeable future, in the event that a determination was made that Columbia Care s proceeds from operations (or any future operations or investments in the United States) could reasonably be shown to constitute proceeds of crime, Columbia Care may decide or be required to suspend declaring or paying dividends without advance notice and for an indefinite period of time.

U.S. border officials could deny entry into the U.S. to employees of, or investors in companies with cannabis operations in the United States. 
 Since cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law, those employed at or investing in legal and licensed cannabis companies could face detention, denial of entry or lifetime bans from the U.S. for their business associations with U.S. cannabis businesses. Entry happens at the sole discretion of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers on duty, and these officers have wide latitude to ask questions to determine the admissibility of a foreign national. The Government of Canada has warned travelers on its website that previous use of cannabis, or any substance prohibited by U.S. federal laws, could mean denial of entry to the U.S. In addition, business or financial involvement in the legal cannabis industry in the United States could also be reason enough for U.S. border guards to deny entry. On September 21, 2018, U.S. Customs and Border Protection released a statement outlining its current position with respect to enforcement of the laws of the United States. It stated that U.S. Customs and Border Protection enforcement of United States laws regarding controlled substances has not changed and because cannabis continues to be a controlled substance under United States law, working in or facilitating the proliferation of the legal cannabis industry in U.S. states where it is deemed legal may affect admissibility to the U.S. As a result, U.S. Customs and Border Protection has affirmed that, a Canadian citizen working in or facilitating the proliferation of the legal cannabis industry in Canada, coming to the U.S. for reasons unrelated to the cannabis industry, will generally be admissible to the U.S.; however, if a traveler is found to be coming to the U.S. for reasons related to the cannabis industry, they may be deemed inadmissible. 
 The Company may lack access to U.S. bankruptcy protections. 
 Since the use of cannabis is illegal under federal law, many courts have denied cannabis businesses bankruptcy protections, thus making it very difficult for lenders to recoup their investments in the cannabis industry in the event of a bankruptcy. If Columbia Care were to experience a bankruptcy, there is no guarantee that U.S. federal bankruptcy protections would be available to Columbia Care s United States subsidiaries and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and prospects of Columbia Care and on the rights of lenders to and securityholders of Columbia Care. 
 The Company may face heightened scrutiny by regulatory authorities. 
 For the reasons set forth above, Columbia Care s existing operations in the United States, and any future operations or investments, may become the subject of heightened scrutiny by regulators, stock exchanges and other authorities in Canada and the U.S. As a result, Columbia Care may be subject to significant direct and indirect interaction with public officials. There can be no assurance that this heightened scrutiny will not in turn lead to the imposition of certain restrictions on Columbia Care s ability to operate or invest in the United States or any other jurisdiction, in addition to those restrictions described herein. It had been reported in Canada that the Canadian Depository for Securities Limited was considering a policy shift that would see its subsidiary, CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc. CDS ), refuse to settle trades for cannabis issuers that have activities in the United States. CDS is Canada s central securities depository, clearing and settling trades in the Canadian equity, fixed income and money markets. The TMX Group, the owner and operator of CDS, subsequently issued a statement on August 17, 2017 reaffirming that there is no CDS ban on the clearing of securities of issuers with cannabis related activities in the United States, despite media reports to the contrary and that the TMX Group was working with regulators to arrive at a solution that will clarify this matter, which would be communicated at a later time. 
 On February 8, 2018, following discussions with the Canadian Securities Administrators and recognized Canadian securities exchanges, the TMX Group announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding MOU with the NEO Exchange, the CSE, the Toronto Stock Exchange, and the TSX Venture Exchange. The MOU outlines the parties understanding of Canada s regulatory framework applicable to the rules, procedures, and regulatory oversight of the exchanges and CDS as it relates to issuers with cannabis-related activities in the United States. The MOU confirms, with respect to the clearing of listed securities, that CDS relies on the exchanges to review the conduct of listed issuers. 
 As a result, there is no CDS ban on the clearing of securities of issuers with cannabis-related activities in the United States. However, there can be no guarantee that this approach to regulation will continue in the future. If such a ban were to be implemented at a time when the Common Shares or other securities of Columbia Care are listed on a stock exchange, it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of holders of Common Shares or such other securities to make and settle trades. In particular, the Common Shares or such other securities would become highly illiquid as until an alternative was implemented, investors would have no ability to effect a trade of the Common Shares or such other securities through the facilities of the applicable stock exchange. 
 Residents of the United States may be unable to settle trades of Columbia Care securities. 
 Given the heightened risk profile associated with cannabis in the United States, capital markets participants may be unwilling to assist with the settlement of trades for U.S. resident securityholders of companies with operations in the United States cannabis industry which may prohibit or significantly impair the ability of securityholders in the United States to trade the securities of Columbia Care. 
 86 

In the event residents of the United States are unable to settle trades of Columbia Care securities, this may affect the pricing of such securities in the secondary market, the transparency and availability of trading prices and the liquidity of these securities. 
 The cannabis industry may experience legal, regulatory or political change. 
 The success of the business strategy of Columbia Care depends on the legality of the cannabis industry. The political environment surrounding the cannabis industry in general can be volatile and the regulatory framework remains in flux. To Columbia Care s knowledge, there are to date a total of 46 states, and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands and Guam that have legalized cannabis in some form; however, the risk remains that a shift in the regulatory or political realm could occur and have a drastic impact on the industry as a whole, adversely impacting Columbia Care s business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. Delays in enactment of new state or federal regulations could restrict the ability of Columbia Care to reach strategic growth targets and lower return on investor capital. The strategic growth strategy of Columbia Care is reliant upon certain federal and state regulations being enacted to facilitate the legalization of medical cannabis. If such regulations are not enacted, or enacted but subsequently repealed or amended, or enacted with prolonged phase-in periods, the growth targets of Columbia Care, and thus, the effect on the return of investor capital, could be detrimental. Columbia Care is unable to predict with certainty when and how the outcome of these complex regulatory and legislative proceedings will affect its business and growth. 
 Further, there is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of cannabis will not be repealed or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. If the federal government begins to enforce federal laws relating to cannabis in states where the sale and use of cannabis is currently legal, or if existing applicable state laws are repealed or curtailed, Columbia Care s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects would be materially adversely affected. It is also important to note that local and city ordinances may strictly limit and/or restrict the sale of cannabis in a manner that will make it extremely difficult or impossible to transact business that is necessary for the continued operation of the cannabis industry. Federal actions against individuals or entities engaged in the cannabis industry or a repeal of applicable cannabis related legislation could adversely affect Columbia Care and its business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 
 States where medical and/or adult use cannabis is legal, currently have or are considering special taxes or fees on businesses in the cannabis industry The implementation of additional taxes and/or fees could have a material adverse effect upon Columbia Care s business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. 
 Overall, the cannabis industry is subject to significant regulatory change at the local, state and federal levels. The inability of Columbia Care to respond to the changing regulatory landscape may cause it to be unsuccessful in capturing significant market share and could otherwise harm its business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. 
 Columbia Care may have difficulty accessing the services of banks, which may make it difficult to operate its business. 
 Financial transactions involving proceeds generated by cannabis-related conduct can form the basis for prosecution under the federal money laundering statutes, unlicensed money transmitter statute and the Bank Secrecy Act. Previous guidance issued by the FinCEN clarifies how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act. Prior to the DOJ s announcement in January 2018 of the rescission of the Cole Memo and related memoranda, supplemental guidance from the DOJ directed federal prosecutors to consider the federal enforcement priorities enumerated in the Cole Memo when determining whether to charge institutions or individuals with any of the financial crimes described above based upon cannabis-related activity. It is unclear if the rescission of the Cole Memo will have an impact, but federal prosecutors may increase enforcement activities against institutions or individuals that are conducting financial transactions related to cannabis activities. The increased uncertainty surrounding financial transactions related to cannabis activities may also result in financial institutions discontinuing services to the cannabis industry. 
 Consequently, those businesses involved in the regulated cannabis industry continue to encounter difficulty establishing banking relationships, which may increase over time. Columbia Care s inability to maintain its current bank accounts would make it difficult for Columbia Care to operate its business, increase its operating costs, and pose additional operational, logistical and security challenges and could result in its inability to implement its business plan. 
 
 Columbia Care may have difficulty accessing public and private capital. 
 Columbia Care has historically and will continue to have access to equity financing from the public capital markets by virtue of its status as a reporting issuer in each of the provinces and territories of Canada (other than Quebec). 
 87 

Columbia Care has historically, and continues to have, access to equity and debt financing from the prospectus exempt (private placement) markets in Canada and the U.S. Columbia Care also has relationships with sources of private capital (such as funds and high net worth individuals) that could provide financing at a higher cost of capital. 
 While Columbia Care is not able to obtain bank financing in the U.S. or financing from other U.S. federally regulated entities, it currently has access to equity financing through the private markets in Canada and the U.S. Since the use of cannabis is illegal under U.S. federal law, and in light of concerns in the banking industry regarding money laundering and other federal financial crime related to cannabis, U.S. banks have been reluctant to accept deposit funds from businesses involved with the cannabis industry. Consequently, businesses involved in the cannabis industry often have difficulty finding a bank willing to accept their business. Likewise, cannabis businesses have limited access, if any, to credit card processing services. As a result, cannabis businesses in the U.S. are to a significant degree cash based. This complicates the implementation of financial controls and increases security issues. 
 Commercial banks, private equity firms and venture capital firms have approached the cannabis industry cautiously to date. However, there are increasing numbers of high-net-worth individuals and family offices that have made meaningful investments in companies and businesses similar to Columbia Care. Although there has been an increase in the amount of private financing available over the last several years, there is neither a broad nor deep pool of institutional capital that is available to cannabis license holders and license applicants. There can be no assurance that additional financing, if raised privately, will be available to Columbia Care when needed or on terms which are acceptable to Columbia Care. Columbia Care s inability to raise financing to fund capital expenditures or acquisitions could limit its growth and may have a material adverse effect upon future profitability. 
 The Company may face unfavorable publicity or consumer perception. 
 Columbia Care believes the cannabis industry is highly dependent upon consumer perception regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of the cannabis produced. Consumer perception of Columbia Care s products can be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, regulatory investigations, litigation, media attention and other publicity regarding the consumption of medical cannabis products. There can be no assurance that future scientific research, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other research findings or publicity will be favorable to the medical cannabis market or any particular product, or consistent with earlier publicity. Columbia Care s dependence upon consumer perceptions means that adverse scientific research reports, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other publicity, whether or not accurate or with merit, could have a material adverse effect on Columbia Care, the demand for products, and the business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of Columbia Care. Further, adverse publicity reports or other media attention regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of medical cannabis in general, or Columbia Care s products specifically, or associating the consumption of medical cannabis with illness or other negative effects or events, could have such a material adverse effect. Such adverse publicity reports or other media attention could arise even if the adverse effects associated with such products resulted from consumers failure to consume such products legally, appropriately or as directed. 
 The results of future clinical research may have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
 Research regarding the medical benefits, viability, safety, efficacy, dosing and social acceptance of cannabis or isolated cannabinoids (such as CBD and THC) remains in early stages. There have been relatively few clinical trials on the benefits of cannabis or isolated cannabinoids (such as CBD and THC). Future research studies and clinical trials may reach negative conclusions regarding the medical benefits, viability, safety, efficacy, dosing, social acceptance or other facts and perceptions related to medical cannabis, which could have a material adverse effect on the demand for Columbia Care s products with the potential to lead to a material adverse effect on Columbia Care s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Expansion into the adult-use cannabis market may subject the Company to additional regulation. 
 Columbia Care has obtained and may continue in the future to pursue licenses to permit the sale of adult-use cannabis where local state law permits such activities. Any change in Columbia Care s strategy would involve the adoption of new local state regulations which are evolving rapidly. Sometimes new risks emerge and management may not be able to predict all of them or be able to predict how they may cause actual results to be different from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Failure to comply with the requirements of local state law or any failure to maintain its licenses would have a material adverse impact on Columbia Care s business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, with each new market that Columbia Care enters, it will incur ongoing costs and obligations related to regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with regulations may result in additional costs for corrective measures, penalties or restrictions imposed on its operations. In addition, changes in regulations, more vigorous enforcement thereof or other unanticipated events could require extensive changes to Columbia Care s operations, increased compliance costs or give rise to material liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, adult use cannabis businesses are not protected by the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment, meaning the risk of federal prosecution are higher for adult use businesses. 
 88 

The Company s business is subject to a variety of laws, regulations and guidelines. 
 Columbia Care s business is subject to a variety of laws, regulations and guidelines relating to the cultivation, manufacture, management, transportation, processing, storage and disposal of cannabis, including laws and regulations relating to health and safety, the conduct of operations and the protection of the environment. Achievement of Columbia Care s business objectives are contingent, in part, upon compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and obtaining all requisite regulatory approvals. Changes to such laws, regulations and guidelines due to matters beyond the control of Columbia Care may cause material adverse effect on Columbia Care s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 
 Columbia Care is required to obtain or renew government permits and licenses for its current and contemplated operations. Obtaining, amending or renewing the necessary governmental permits and licenses can be a time- consuming process potentially involving numerous regulatory agencies, involving public hearings and costly undertakings on Columbia Care s part. The duration and success of Columbia Care s efforts to obtain, amend and renew permits and licenses are contingent upon many variables not within its control, including the interpretation of applicable requirements implemented by the relevant permitting or licensing authority. Columbia Care may not be able to obtain, amend or renew permits or licenses that are necessary to its operations. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the permitting and licensing process could impede the ongoing or proposed operations of Columbia Care. To the extent necessary permits or licenses are not obtained, amended or renewed, or are subsequently suspended or revoked, Columbia Care may be curtailed or prohibited from proceeding with its ongoing operations or planned development and commercialization activities. Such curtailment or prohibition may result in a material adverse effect on Columbia Care s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 
 While Columbia Care s compliance controls have been developed to mitigate the risk of any material violations of any license or certificate it holds arising, there is no assurance that Columbia Care s licenses or certificates will be renewed by each applicable regulatory authority in the future in a timely manner. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the licensing renewal process for any of the licenses or certificates held by Columbia Care could impede the ongoing or planned operations of Columbia Care and have a material adverse effect on Columbia Care s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. The Company may face penalties for regulatory violations 
 Columbia Care s business and activities are heavily regulated in all jurisdictions where it conducts business. Our operations are subject to various laws, regulations and guidance by state and local governmental authorities relating to the manufacture, marketing, management, transportation, storage, sale, pricing and disposal of cannabis and cannabis, as well as other federal, state, and local laws, regulations and guidance. While Columbia Care follows the law in all jurisdictions where it conducts business and pays full attention to continuing compliance, any failure to comply with the statutory, regulatory, or other requirements of Columbia Care s operations may lead to possible sanctions including the revocation of licenses, suspension of licenses, or imposition of additional conditions on licenses or the imposition of fines or other penalties. Maintaining compliance with complex and often-changing regulations increases the risk that even a materially compliant business can be found in violation of one or more laws, rules or regulations while remaining materially or substantially compliant with applicable state cannabis laws. For these reasons, Columbia Care could face penalties for regulatory violations that could have a material adverse effect on Columbia Care s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 
 
 The Company may face risks related to FDA and FTC enforcement. 
 The manufacture, labeling and distribution of Columbia Care s CBD products is regulated by various federal, state and local agencies including, without limitation, the FDA, the FTC and analogous state agencies. The FDA has taken the position that CBD cannot be added to food or marketed in, or as, a dietary supplement because it is an active ingredient in an FDA approved drug and was the subject of substantial clinical investigations before it was marketed as a food or dietary supplement, a restriction generally referred to as the IND Preclusion . If the FDA were to begin strict enforcement actions against manufacturers of products containing hemp-derived CBD, whether based on the IND Preclusion or other provisions of the FD C Act, this would adversely impact Columbia Care s business and financial condition. Failure to comply with FDA requirements may result in, among other things, injunctions, product withdrawals, recalls, product seizures, fines and criminal prosecutions. 
 Our advertising activities are also subject to regulation by the FTC under the Federal Trade Commission Act. In recent years, the FTC has initiated numerous investigations of CBD products and companies based on allegedly deceptive or misleading claims. Notably, on December 17, 2020, the FTC announced its first law enforcement crackdown on deceptive claims in the growing market for CBD products. The FTC took action against six sellers of CBD products for allegedly making a wide range of scientifically unsupported claims about their ability to treat serious health conditions. Among other things, each of these CBD-selling companies, and the individuals behind them, were required to stop making such unsupported health claims immediately, and several will pay monetary judgments to the agency. While this enforcement action and the warning letters issued by the FDA and FTC have been aimed at companies making unapproved health claims about CBD products, the enforcement strategies of the FDA and FTC can change at any 
 89 

time. Additionally, some states also permit advertising and labeling laws to be enforced by state attorney generals, who may seek relief for consumers, seek class-action certifications, seek class-wide damages and product recalls of Columbia Care s CBD products. Any actions against us by any governmental authorities or private litigants could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Columbia Care may become involved in a number of government or agency proceedings, investigations and audits. The outcome of any regulatory or agency proceedings, investigations, audits, and other contingencies could harm Columbia Care s reputation, require Columbia Care to take, or refrain from taking, actions that could harm its operations or require Columbia Care to pay substantial amounts of funds, harming its financial condition. There can be no assurance that any pending or future regulatory or agency proceedings, investigations and audits will not result in substantial costs or a diversion of management s attention and resources or have a material adverse impact on Columbia Care s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 
 Cannabis businesses are subject to unfavorable tax treatment as a result of Section 280E. 
 Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code generally prohibits businesses from deducting or claiming tax credits with respect to expenses paid or incurred in carrying on any trade or business if such trade or business (or the activities which comprise such trade or business) consists of trafficking in controlled substances (within the meaning of Schedule I and II of the CSA) which is prohibited by U.S. federal law or the law of any state in which such trade or business is conducted. Section 280E currently applies to businesses operating in the cannabis industry, irrespective of whether such businesses that are licensed and operating in accordance with applicable state laws. The application of Section 280E generally causes such businesses to pay higher effective tax rates than most industries. As a result of Section 280E, the Company s effective tax rate can be highly variable and depends on how large its ratio of non-deductible expenses is to its total revenues. The application of Section 280E to Columbia Care may adversely affect Columbia Care s profitability and, in fact, may cause Columbia Care to operate at a loss. There have been efforts at reforming federal cannabis law, however, none removing the impact or scope of Section 280E have passed into law and Section 280E will continue to apply to Columbia Care indefinitely. While recent legislative proposals, if enacted into law, could eliminate or diminish the application of Section 280E to cannabis businesses, the enactment of any such law is uncertain. Accordingly, Section 280E may to apply to Columbia Care indefinitely. 
 
 The Company s service providers may suspend or withdraw their services. 
 As a result of any adverse change to the approach in enforcement of United States cannabis laws, adverse regulatory or political change, additional scrutiny by regulatory authorities, adverse change in public perception in respect of the consumption of cannabis or otherwise, third party service providers to Columbia Care could suspend or withdraw their services, which may have a material adverse effect on Columbia Care s business, revenues, operating results, financial condition or prospects. 
 The Company may be unable to enforce its contracts. 
 It is a fundamental principle of law that a contract will not be enforced if it involves a violation of law or public policy. Since cannabis remains illegal in the United States at a federal level, judges in multiple U.S. states have on a number of occasions refused to enforce contracts for the repayment of money when the loan was used in connection with activities that violate federal law, even if there is no violation of state law. There remains doubt and uncertainty that Columbia Care will be able to legally enforce contracts it enters into if necessary. Columbia Care cannot be assured that it will have a remedy for breach of contract, which would have a material adverse effect on Columbia Care s business, revenues, operating results, financial condition and prospects. 
 Ability to grow Columbia Care s business depends on state laws pertaining to the cannabis industry. 
 Continued development of the cannabis industry depends upon continued legislative authorization of cannabis at the state level. The status quo of, or progress in, the regulated cannabis industry is not assured and any number of factors could slow or halt further progress in this area. While there may be ample public support for legislative action permitting the manufacture and use of cannabis, numerous factors impact the legislative process. For example, many states that voted to legalize medical and/or adult-use cannabis have seen significant delays in the drafting and implementation of industry regulations and issuance of licenses. In addition, burdensome regulation at the state level could slow or stop further development of the medical cannabis industry, such as limiting the medical conditions for which medical cannabis can be recommended by physicians for treatment, restricting the form in which cannabis can be consumed, imposing significant registration requirements on physicians and patients or imposing significant taxes on the growth, processing and/or retail sales of cannabis, which could have the impact of dampening growth of the cannabis industry and making it difficult for cannabis businesses to operate profitably in those states. Any one of these factors could slow or halt additional legislative authorization of cannabis, which could harm Columbia Care s business, revenues, operating results, financial condition and prospects. 
 90 

Reliable data on the cannabis industry is not available. 
 As a result of recent and ongoing regulatory and policy changes in the medical cannabis industry, the market data available is limited and unreliable. Federal and state laws prevent widespread participation and hinder market research. Therefore, market research and projections by Columbia Care of estimated total retail sales, demographics, demand, and similar consumer research, are based on assumptions from limited and unreliable market data. 
 Conversions and potential future sales of shares could adversely affect prevailing market prices for the common shares. 
 Subject to the restrictions set forth in the articles of Columbia Care (the Articles ), Common Shares may at any time, at the option of the holder, be converted into Proportionate Voting Shares on the basis of 100 Common Shares for one Proportionate Voting Share. Subject to the restrictions set forth in Columbia Care s Articles, each issued and outstanding Proportionate Voting Share may at any time, at the option of the holder, be converted into 100 Common Shares. 
 Further, Columbia Care cannot predict the size of future issuances of Common Shares or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of Common Shares will have on the market price of the Common Shares. Sales of substantial amounts of Common Shares, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for the Common Shares. The market price of the Common Shares could be adversely affected upon the expiration of lock up periods applicable to certain Columbia Care shareholders. 
 Additional issuances of Common Shares, Proportionate Voting Shares, and Preferred Shares may result in dilution. 
 The Company may issue additional equity or convertible debt securities in the future, which may dilute existing shareholder s holdings. The Articles permit the issuance of an unlimited number of Common Shares, Proportionate Voting Shares, and Preferred Shares (as defined herein), and existing shareholders will have no pre-emptive rights in connection with such further issuances. The Board has discretion to determine the price and the terms of further issuances, and such terms could include rights, preferences and privileges superior to those existing holders of Subordinated Voting Shares. 
 The Company cannot predict the size or nature of future issuances or the effect that future issuances and sales of Common Shares, Proportionate Voting Shares, and Preferred Shares will have on the market price of the Common Shares registered hereunder. Issuances of a substantial number of additional Common Shares, Proportionate Voting Shares, and Preferred Shares, or the perception that such issuances could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for the Common Shares. With any additional issuance of Common Shares, Proportionate Voting Shares, and Preferred Shares, investors will suffer dilution to their voting power and economic interest in the Company. 
 The Company s Articles provides that the Supreme Court of the Province of British Columbia, Canada and the appellate Courts therefrom are the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action brought on behalf of the Company, which may limit our investors flexibility in selecting a forum for any future disputes. 
 The Company s Articles provides that the Supreme Court of the Province of British Columbia, Canada and the appellate Courts therefrom are the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action brought on behalf of the company. The choice of forum provision may limit an investor s ability to bring a derivative claim in a judicial forum of its choosing. 
 The Company may grow low quality cannabis. 
 Columbia Care currently operates in an early-stage market which has a small representation of medical or adult-use cannabis consumers. Should Columbia Care be unable to grow a quality product demanded by the consumers, this could have a material impact on Columbia Care s revenues and average price per gram. 
 The Company faces risks inherent in the agricultural business. 
 Columbia Care s business involves the growing of cannabis, which is an agricultural product. As such, the business is subject to the risks inherent in the agricultural business, including but not limited to, pests, plant diseases, crop failure and similar agricultural risks. Although Columbia Care grows some of its products indoors under climate-controlled conditions and carefully monitors the growing conditions of its products with trained personnel, there can be no assurance that natural elements will not have a material adverse effect on the volume, quality and consistency of its products and consequently on Columbia Care s sales, profitability and financial condition. 
 91 

Climate change could exacerbate certain of the risks inherent in Columbia Care s agricultural operations. 
 Climate change could result in increasing frequency and severity of weather-related events, resource shortages, changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages and changing temperatures, and of which can damage or destroy crops, resulting in Columbia Care having no or limited cannabis flower to process. If Columbia Care is unable to harvest cannabis flower through its proprietary operations, its ability to meet customer demand, generate sales, and maintain operations will be impacted. Furthermore, severe weather-related events may result in substantial costs to Columbia Care, including costs to respond during the event, to recover from the event, and to possibly modify existing or future infrastructure requirements to prevent recurrence. Climate changes could also disrupt Columbia Care s operations by impacting the availability and costs of materials needed for production and could increase insurance and other operating costs. 
 Columbia Care may be directly or indirectly exposed to climate change risk from natural disasters, changes in weather patterns and severe weather, which may result in physical damage to Columbia Care s cultivation and processing facilities. Such damage may result in disrupted operations, and it may be difficult for Columbia Care to continue its business for a substantial period of time, which could materially adversely impact Columbia Care s business, financial condition or operating results and could cause the market value of its Common Shares to decline. In addition, climate change has continued to attract the focus of governments, the scientific community and the general public as an important threat, given the emission of greenhouse gases and other activities continue to negatively impact the planet. Columbia Care faces the risk that its operations will be subject to government initiatives aimed at countering climate change, which could impose constraints on its operational flexibility. 
 The Company may face risks related to its third-party product manufacturers. 
 All of Columbia Care s hemp-derived CBD products are produced, packaged, and labeled by third-party vendors. The Company relies on its third-party vendors to obtain and maintain certain permits, licenses or other approvals from regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions in which they operate, including, in the case of certain jurisdictions, the ability to demonstrate compliance with current good manufacturing practice standards. Failure of a third-party vendor to maintain the requisite permits, licenses or other approvals, or otherwise conform to the strict regulatory requirements of any applicable regulatory authority may result in delays, interruptions in supply, product recalls or withdrawals, and could expose the Company to potential product liability claims, damage our reputation and the reputation of our brands or otherwise harm our business. 
 The Company is exposed to product liability claims. 
 As a distributor of products designed to be ingested by humans, Columbia Care faces an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims, regulatory action and litigation if its products are alleged to have caused significant loss or injury. In addition, the sale of Columbia Care s products involves the risk of injury to consumers due to tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination. Previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of Columbia Care s products alone or in combination with other medications or substances could occur. Columbia Care may be subject to various product liability claims, for which insurance coverage may not be available, including, among others, that Columbia Care s products caused injury or illness, include inadequate instructions for use or include inadequate warnings concerning possible side effects or interactions with other substances. A product liability claim or regulatory action against Columbia Care could result in increased costs, could adversely affect Columbia Care s reputation with its clients and consumers generally, and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of Columbia Care. 
 The Company s products may be subject to product recalls. 
 Manufacturers and distributors of products are sometimes subject to the recall or return of their products for a variety of reasons, including product defects, such as contamination, unintended harmful side effects or interactions with other substances, packaging safety and inadequate or inaccurate labelling disclosure. If any of Columbia Care s products are recalled due to an alleged product defect or for any other reason, Columbia Care could be required to incur the unexpected expense of the recall and any legal proceedings that might arise in connection with the recall. Columbia Care may lose a significant amount of sales and may not be able to replace those sales at an acceptable margin or at all. 
 
 Significant failure or deterioration of Columbia Care s quality control systems could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
 The quality and safety of Columbia Care s products are critical to the success of its business and operations. As such, it is imperative that Columbia Care s quality control systems operate effectively and successfully. Quality control systems can be negatively impacted by the design of the quality control systems, the quality training program, and adherence by employees to quality control guidelines. Although Columbia Care strives to ensure that it and any of its service providers have implemented and adhere to high caliber quality 
 92 

control systems, any significant failure or deterioration of such quality control systems could have a material adverse effect on Columbia Care s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 
 The Company is subject to environmental risk and regulation. 
 Columbia Care s operations are subject to environmental regulation in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. These regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards and land reclamation. They also set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors (or the equivalent thereof) and employees. There is no assurance that future changes in environmental regulation, if any, will not adversely affect Columbia Care s operations. 
 Government approvals and permits are currently, and may in the future, be required in connection with Columbia Care s operations. To the extent such approvals are required and not obtained, Columbia Care may be curtailed or prohibited from its current or proposed production, manufacturing or sale of cannabis or from proceeding with the development of its operations as currently proposed. 
 Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions thereunder, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, and may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment, or remedial actions. Columbia Care may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of its operations and may have civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations. 
 Amendments to current laws, regulations and permits governing the production or manufacturing of cannabis, or more stringent implementation thereof, could have a material adverse impact on Columbia Care and cause increases in expenses, capital expenditures or production or manufacturing costs or reduction in levels of production or manufacturing or require abandonment or delays in development. 
 The Company has limited operating history. 
 As a high growth enterprise, Columbia Care has a limited history of profitability. Columbia Care is therefore subject to many of the risks common to early-stage enterprises, including under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financial, and other resources and lack of earnings. There is no assurance that Columbia Care will be successful in achieving a return on shareholders investment and the likelihood of success must be considered in light of the early stage of operations. 
 The Company had negative cash flow from operations during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. 
 During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, Columbia Care sustained net losses from operations and had negative cash flow from operating activities. Columbia Care s cash as at December 31, 2022 was approximately 48.1 million. Although Columbia Care anticipates it will eventually have positive cash flow from operating activities, to the extent that Columbia Care has negative cash flow in any future period, certain of the proceeds from any offering of securities of Columbia Care may be used to fund such negative cash flow from operating activities. 
 The Company faces intense competition from other companies. 
 There is potential that Columbia Care will face intense competition from other companies, some of which can be expected to have longer operating histories and more financial resources and experience than Columbia Care. Increased competition by larger and better financed competitors could materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of Columbia Care. As a result of the early stage of the industry in which Columbia Care operates, Columbia Care expects to face additional competition from new entrants. To become and remain competitive, Columbia Care will require research and development, marketing, sales and support. Columbia Care may not have sufficient resources to maintain research and development, marketing, sales and support efforts on a competitive basis which could materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of Columbia Care. 
 The cannabis industry is undergoing rapid growth and substantial change, which has resulted in an increase in competitors, consolidation and formation of strategic relationships. Acquisitions or other consolidating transactions could harm the Company in a number of ways, including losing customers, revenue and market share, or forcing the Company to expend greater resources to meet new or additional competitive threats, all of which could harm the Company s operating results. As competitors enter the market and 
 93 

become increasingly sophisticated, competition in the Company s industry may intensify and place downward pressure on retail prices for its products and services, which could negatively impact its profitability. 
 New well-capitalized entrants into the medical cannabis industry may develop large-scale operations. 
 Currently, the cannabis industry generally is comprised of individuals and small to medium-sized entities; however, the risk exists that large conglomerates and companies who also recognize the potential for financial success through investment in this industry could strategically purchase or assume control of larger or a larger number of dispensaries and cultivation and production facilities, which such trend is now being observed by Columbia Care. In doing so, these larger competitors could establish price setting and cost controls which would effectively price out many of the individuals and small to medium-sized entities who currently make up the bulk of the participants in the varied businesses operating within and in support of the cannabis industry. While the approach in most state laws and regulations seemingly deters this type of takeover, this industry remains nascent and as indicated above, the future landscape remains largely unknown, especially as relates to the potential for interstate commerce in the cannabis industry in the United States, which might potentially be more advantageous to large conglomerates and companies as compared to Columbia Care. 
 The Company is vulnerable to rising energy costs. 
 Cannabis growing operations consume considerable energy, making Columbia Care potentially vulnerable to rising energy costs. Rising or volatile energy costs may adversely impact the business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects of Columbia Care. 
 The Company is reliant is on key inputs. 
 The cannabis business is dependent on a number of key inputs and their related costs including raw materials and supplies related to growing operations, as well as electricity, water and other local utilities. Any significant interruption or negative change in the availability or economics of the supply chain for key inputs could materially impact the business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of Columbia Care. Some of these inputs may only be available from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. If a sole source supplier was to go out of business, Columbia Care might be unable to find a replacement for such source in a timely manner or at all. If a sole source supplier were to be acquired by a competitor, that competitor may elect not to sell to Columbia Care in the future. Any inability to secure a replacement for such source in a timely manner or at all could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of Columbia Care. 
 The Company is reliant on suppliers and skilled labor. 
 The ability of Columbia Care to compete and grow will be dependent on it having access, at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, to skilled labor, equipment, parts and components. No assurances can be given that Columbia Care will be successful in maintaining its required supply of skilled labor, equipment, parts and components. It is also possible that the final costs of the major equipment contemplated by Columbia Care s capital expenditure plans may be significantly greater than anticipated by Columbia Care s management and may be greater than the funds available to Columbia Care, in which circumstance Columbia Care may curtail, or extend the timeframes for completing, its capital expenditure plans. This could have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of Columbia Care. 
 The Company s sales are difficult to forecast. 
 Columbia Care must rely largely on its own market research to forecast sales as detailed forecasts are not generally obtainable from other sources at this early stage of the cannabis industry. A failure in the demand for its products to materialize as a result of competition, technological change or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects of Columbia Care. 
 The Company faces intellectual property risks. 
 Columbia Care may have certain proprietary intellectual property, including but not limited to patents and proprietary processes, and plans for trademarks that are not yet public. Columbia Care will rely on this intellectual property, know- how and other proprietary information, and require employees, consultants and suppliers to sign confidentiality agreements. However, these confidentiality agreements may be breached, and Columbia Care may not have adequate remedies for such breaches. Third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information without infringing upon any proprietary technology. Third parties may otherwise gain access to Columbia Care s proprietary information and adopt it in a competitive manner. Any loss of intellectual property protection may have a material adverse effect on Columbia Care s business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. 
 94 

As long as cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance pursuant to the CSA, the benefit of certain federal laws and protections which may be available to most businesses, such as federal trademark and patent protection regarding the intellectual property of a business, may not be available to Columbia Care. As a result, Columbia Care s intellectual property may never be adequately or sufficiently protected against the use or misappropriation by third parties. In addition, since the regulatory framework of the cannabis industry is in a constant state of flux, Columbia Care can provide no assurance that it will ever obtain any protection of its intellectual property, whether on a federal, provincial, state or local level. While many states do offer the ability to protect trademarks independent of the federal government, patent protection is wholly unavailable on a state level, and state-registered trademarks provide a lower degree of protection than would federally-registered marks. 
 The Company may not be able to protect its patents. 
 If some or all of Columbia Care s patents expire or are invalidated or are found to be unenforceable, or if some or all of its patent applications do not contain patentable subject matter because the claims are determined to lack utility, novelty, or non-obviousness, or do not result in issued patents or result in patents with narrow, overbroad, or unenforceable claims, or claims that are not supported in regard to written description or enablement by the specification, Columbia Care may be subject to competition from third parties with products in the same class as its own products or devices, including in those jurisdictions in which Columbia Care has no patent protection. 
 
 Even if Columbia Care s products, devices, and/or the processes, or methods for treating patients for prescribed indications using these products and/or devices are covered by valid and enforceable patents and have claims with sufficient scope, disclosure and support in the specification, the patents will provide protection only for a limited amount of time. Columbia Care s ability to obtain patents can be highly uncertain and involve complex and in some cases unsettled legal issues and factual questions. Furthermore, different countries have different procedures for obtaining patents, and patents issued in different countries provide different degrees of protection against the use of a patented invention by others. Therefore, the scope and enforceability of Columbia Care s patents may differ across those countries in which Columbia Care is seeking patent protection, and Columbia Care s ability to protect its intellectual property in some countries may be limited accordingly. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. 
 Columbia Care may be subject to competition from third parties with products or devices in the same class as its products or devices in those jurisdictions in which it has no patent protection. Even if patents are issued to Columbia Care regarding its products, devices, and/or methods of using them, those patents can be challenged by its competitors who can argue such patents are invalid or unenforceable, lack utility, lack sufficient written description or enablement, or should be limited or narrowly construed. Patents also will not protect Columbia Care s product candidates if competitors devise ways of making or using these product candidates without legally infringing Columbia Care s patents. 
 Columbia Care also relies on trade secrets to protect its technology, especially where it does not believe that patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Columbia Care s employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose its confidential information to competitors, and confidentiality agreements may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using Columbia Care s trade secrets is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Moreover, Columbia Care s competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect Columbia Care s competitive business position. 
 The Company may not be able to protect its trademarks. 
 Apart from the federal illegality issues discussed above, Columbia Care s trademark applications may encounter other obstacles, including refusals or oppositions based on third party rights or issues such as the mere descriptiveness of a proposed trademark. In that event, Columbia Care has opportunities to respond, but may not be able to overcome the refusals or challenges. Once a trademark is registered, third parties can also bring cancellation proceedings, which may be successful in cancelling Columbia Care s registrations. Unregistered trademarks can be more challenging to protect and enforce, and an adverse decision with respect to registration, based on third party rights, can increase the risk of an infringement action. 
 The Company may infringe on intellectual property rights of third parties. 
 There is a risk that Columbia Care is infringing the proprietary rights of third parties because numerous United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields that are the focus of Columbia Care s development and manufacturing efforts. Others might have been the first to make the inventions covered by one or more of its pending patent applications and/or might have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions. Furthermore, because of 
 95 

historical policies and laws disfavoring the patenting and publication of cannabis-related technologies, prior art relevant to Columbia Care s or its competitors patents and patent applications may not be readily identified during normal patent examination processes, resulting in the issuance of claims that might not have issued in a better documented field. In addition, because patent applications take many months to publish and patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to Columbia Care, which may later result in issued patents that cover the production, manufacture, synthesis, commercialization, formulation or use of Columbia Care s products. In addition, the production, manufacture, synthesis, commercialization, formulation or use of Columbia Care s products may infringe existing patents of which Columbia Care is not aware. Similarly, a third party could take the position that Columbia Care is infringing its trademark rights, based on other registered or unregistered trademarks. Even if Columbia Care ultimately defeats a third party s claims, defending itself against third-party claims, including litigation in particular, would be costly and time consuming and would divert management s attention from its business, which could lead to delays in Columbia Care s development or commercialization efforts. If third parties are successful in their claims, Columbia Care may have to pay substantial damages, including the potential for treble damages if willful infringement is found, or take other actions that are adverse to Columbia Care s business. 
 The Company faces competition from synthetic production and technological advances. 
 The pharmaceutical industry may attempt to dominate the cannabis industry through the development and distribution of synthetic products which emulate the effects and treatment of organic cannabis. If they are successful, the widespread popularity of such synthetic products could change the demand, volume and profitability of the cannabis industry. This could adversely affect the ability of Columbia Care to secure long-term profitability and success through the sustainable and profitable operation of its business. 
 The Company may face constraints on marketing products. 
 The development of Columbia Care s business and operating results may be hindered by applicable restrictions on sales and marketing activities imposed by government regulatory bodies. The regulatory environment in the United States limits companies abilities to compete for market share in a manner similar to other industries. If Columbia Care is unable to effectively market its products and compete for market share, or if the costs of compliance with government legislation and regulation cannot be absorbed through increased selling prices for its products, Columbia Care s sales and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 The Company may be exposed to risk of fraudulent or illegal activity by employees, contractors and consultants. 
 Columbia Care is exposed to the risk that its employees, independent contractors and consultants may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent unauthorized conduct that violates: (i) government regulations; (ii) manufacturing standards; (iii) federal, state and provincial healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations; (iv) laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data; or (v) contractual arrangements, including confidentiality requirements. It may not always be possible for Columbia Care to identify and deter misconduct by its employees and other third parties, and the precautions taken by Columbia Care to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting Columbia Care from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or contractual requirements. If any such actions are instituted against Columbia Care, and it is not successful in defending itself or asserting its rights, those actions could have a significant impact on Columbia Care s business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of Columbia Care s operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Columbia Care s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 
 Certain jurisdictions currently prohibit public company ownership of cannabis businesses. 
 Certain jurisdictions in the United States prohibit persons that are declared unqualified to hold a cannabis establishment license, which can include any publicly-traded company. In such circumstances, the prohibition against the issuance of a cannabis establishment business license may not be limited to the direct licensee but extend to owners of such licensees including parent-companies. As such, a publicly-traded company may be denied the issuance of a cannabis establishment business license in such jurisdictions which could limit Columbia Care s ability to expand. 
 The Company depends on information technology systems and may experience cyber-attacks. 
 Columbia Care s operations depend, in part, on how well it and its suppliers protect networks, equipment, information technology systems and software against damage from a number of threats, including, but not limited to, cable cuts, damage to physical plants, natural disasters, intentional damage and destruction, fire, power loss, hacking, computer viruses, vandalism and theft. Columbia Care s operations also depend on the timely maintenance, upgrade and replacement of networks, equipment, information technology 
 96 

systems and software, as well as pre-emptive expenses to mitigate the risks of failures. Any of these and other events could result in information system failures, delays and/or increase in capital expenses. The failure of information systems or a component of information systems could, depending on the nature of any such failure, adversely impact Columbia Care s reputation and results of operations. Columbia Care has not experienced any material losses to date relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, but there can be no assurance that Columbia Care will not incur such losses in the future. Columbia Care s risk and exposure to these matters cannot be fully mitigated because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats. As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of controls, processes and practices designed to protect systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access is a priority. As cyber threats continue to evolve, Columbia Care may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance protective measures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. 
 A security breach may have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
 Given the nature of Columbia Care s products and its lack of legal availability outside of channels approved by the United States federal government, as well as the concentration of inventory in its facilities, despite meeting or exceeding all legislative security requirements, there remains a risk of shrinkage as well as theft. A security breach at one of Columbia Care s facilities could expose Columbia Care to additional liability and to potentially costly litigation, increase expenses relating to the resolution and future prevention of these breaches and may deter potential customers from choosing Columbia Care s products. In addition, Columbia Care collects and stores personal information about its customers and is responsible for protecting that information from privacy breaches. A privacy breach may occur through procedural or process failure, information technology malfunction, or deliberate unauthorized intrusions. Theft of data for competitive purposes, particularly customer lists and preferences, is an ongoing risk whether perpetrated via employee collusion or negligence or through deliberate cyber-attack. Any such theft or privacy breach would have a material adverse effect on Columbia Care s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
 We have been, and expect to continue to be, a target of cyberattacks. If our internal networks, systems, or data are or are perceived to have been compromised, our reputation may be damaged and our financial results may be negatively affected. 
 
 We have in the past been, and may in the future be, specifically targeted by bad actors for attacks intended to circumvent our security capabilities or to exploit our platform as an entry point into customers endpoints, networks, or systems. We are also susceptible to inadvertent compromises of our systems and data, including those arising from process, coding, or human errors. We also utilize third-party service providers to, among other things, host, transmit, or otherwise process electronic data in connection with our business activities, including our supply chain, operations, and communications. Our third-party service providers and other vendors have faced and may continue to face cyberattacks, compromises, interruptions in service, or other security incidents from a variety of sources. A successful attack or other incident that results in an interruption of service or that compromises our or our service providers internal networks, systems, or data could have a significant negative effect on our operations, reputation, financial resources, and the value of our intellectual property. We cannot assure you that any of our efforts to manage this risk, including adoption of a comprehensive incident response plan and process for detecting, mitigating, and investigating security incidents that we regularly test through table-top exercises, testing of our security protocols through additional techniques, such as penetration testing, debriefing after security incidents, to improve our security and responses, and regular briefing of our directors and officers on our cybersecurity risks, preparedness, and management, will be effective in protecting us from such attacks. It is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate the risk of such attacks, compromises, interruptions in service, or other security incidents affecting our internal systems or data, or that of our third-party service providers and vendors. Organizations are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their supply chain, networks, systems, and endpoints, and techniques used to sabotage or to obtain unauthorized access to networks in which data is stored or through which data is transmitted change frequently. Furthermore, employee error or malicious activity could compromise our systems. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate measures to prevent an intrusion into our networks, which could result in unauthorized access to customer data, intellectual property, or lead to cyberattacks or other intrusions, litigation, governmental audits and investigations and significant legal fees, any or all of which could damage our relationships with our existing customers and could have a negative effect on our ability to attract and retain new customers. We have expended, and anticipate continuing to expend, significant resources in an effort to prevent security breaches and other security incidents impacting our systems and data. 
 
 In addition, while we maintain insurance policies that may cover certain liabilities in connection with a cybersecurity incident, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, results of operations and reputation. 
 97 

The Company is subject to high bonding and may face difficulty obtaining insurance coverage. 
 There is a risk that a greater number of state regulatory agencies will begin requiring entities engaged in certain aspects of the business or industry of cannabis to post a bond or significant fees when, for example, applying for a dispensary license or renewal as a guarantee of payment of sales and franchise tax. Columbia Care is not able to quantify at this time the potential scope for such bonds or fees in the states in which it currently or may in the future operate. Any bonds or fees of material amounts could have a negative impact on the ultimate success of Columbia Care s business. 
 Columbia Care s business is subject to a number of risks and hazards generally, including adverse environmental conditions, accidents, labor disputes and changes in the regulatory environment. Such occurrences could result in damage to assets, personal injury or death, environmental damage, delays in operations, monetary losses and possible legal liability. Although Columbia Care maintains insurance to protect against certain risks in such amounts as it considers to be reasonable, its insurance does not cover all the potential risks associated with its operations. Columbia Care may also be unable to maintain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible premiums. Insurance coverage may not continue to be available or may not be adequate to cover any resulting liability. Moreover, insurance against risks such as environmental pollution or other hazards encountered in the operations of Columbia Care is not generally available on acceptable terms. Columbia Care might also become subject to liability for pollution, fire, explosion or other hazards which it may not be insured against or which Columbia Care may elect not to insure against because of premium costs or other reasons. Losses from these events may cause Columbia Care to incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect upon its business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. 
 Due to the Company s involvement in the cannabis industry, it may have a difficult time obtaining the various insurances that are desired to operate its business, which may expose Columbia Care to additional risk and financial liability. Insurance that is otherwise readily available, such as general liability, and directors and officer s insurance, may be more difficult to find, and more expensive, because of the regulatory regime applicable to the industry. There are no guarantees that Columbia Care will be able to find such insurance coverage in the future, or that the cost will be affordable. If the Company is forced to go without such insurance coverage, it may prevent it from entering into certain business sectors, may inhibit growth, and may expose Columbia Care to additional risk and financial liabilities. 
 Columbia Care may not pay dividends. 
 The declaration and payment of dividends or distributions by Columbia Care will be at the discretion of the Board subject to restrictions under applicable laws, and may be affected by numerous factors, including Columbia Care s revenues, financial condition, acquisitions, capital investment requirements and legal, regulatory or contractual restrictions. A failure to pay dividends or a reduction or cessation of the payment of dividends could materially adversely affect the trading price of Common Shares. 
 The Company may be subject to international regulations. 
 Columbia Care is subject to the laws and regulations of (as well as international treaties among) the foreign jurisdictions in which it operates or imports or exports products or materials. Failure by Columbia Care to comply with the current or evolving regulatory framework in any jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on Columbia Care s business, financial condition and results of operations. There is the possibility that any such international jurisdiction could determine that Columbia Care was not or is not compliant with applicable local regulations. If Columbia Care s sales or operations were found to be in violation of such international regulations Columbia Care may be subject to enforcement actions in such jurisdictions including, but not limited to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of Columbia Care s operations or asset seizures and the denial of regulatory applications. 
 The Company s use of customer information and other personal and confidential information may have an adverse impact. 
 Columbia Care collects, processes, maintains and uses data, including sensitive information on individuals (with consent when applicable) available to Columbia Care through online activities and other customer interactions with its business. Columbia Care s current and future programs may depend on its ability to collect, maintain and use this information, and its ability to do so is subject to evolving international, U.S. and Canadian laws and enforcement trends. Columbia Care strives to comply with all applicable laws and other legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection and customer protection. It is possible, however, that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another, conflict with other rules, conflict with Columbia Care s practices or fail to be observed by its employees or business partners. If so, Columbia Care may suffer damage to its reputation and be subject to proceedings or actions against it by governmental entities or others. Any such proceeding or action could hurt Columbia Care s reputation, force it to spend significant amounts to defend its practices, distract its management or otherwise have an adverse effect on its business. 
 98 

The Company is subject to taxation in both Canada and the United States. 
 Columbia Care is treated as a U.S. domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. Consequently, Columbia Care is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its worldwide taxable income. Since Columbia Care is a resident of Canada for purposes of the Tax Act, Columbia Care is also subject to Canadian income tax. Consequently, Columbia Care is liable for both U.S. and Canadian income tax, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations, and could inhibit efficient use of its capital. 
 The Company may be subject to net operating loss and certain other tax attribute limitations. 
 Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code contains rules that limit for U.S. federal income tax purposes the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to utilize its net operating losses (and certain other tax attributes) existing as of the date of such ownership change. Under these rules, a corporation is treated as having had an ownership change if there is a cumulative change of more than a 50 percentage points in stock ownership by one or more five percent shareholders, within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, during a rolling three-year period. If finalized, Treasury Regulations currently proposed under Section 382 of the Code may further limit Columbia Care s ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses or other tax attributes if Columbia Care were to undergo a future ownership change. Columbia Care may have experienced ownership changes in the past, and it may experience ownership changes in the future and/or subsequent shifts in its stock ownership (some of which may be outside the control of Columbia Care). Thus, Columbia Care s ability to utilize carryforwards of its net operating losses and other tax attributes to reduce future tax liabilities may be substantially restricted. At this time, Columbia Care has not completed a study to assess the impact, if any, of ownership changes on its net operating losses and certain other tax attributes under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
 Dividends may be subject to Canadian and/or United States withholding tax. 
 It is unlikely the company will pay dividends on its voting shares in the foreseeable future. However, in the unlikely event of a dividend, such dividends may not be eligible for foreign tax credits and may be subject to complex and unfavorable withholding tax laws and may not qualify for a reduced rate of withholding under the Canada-United States Income Tax Convention (1980) as amended. 
 Transfers of Common Shares may be subject to United States gift, estate and transfer taxes. 
 Because the Common Shares will be treated as shares of a U.S. domestic corporation, the U.S. gift, estate and generation-skipping transfer tax rules generally will apply to a Non-U.S. Holder of Common Shares. 
 Changes in tax laws may affect the Company and its shareholders. 
 There can be no assurance that that the Canadian and U.S. general and industry specific tax laws and regulations of Columbia Care or an investment in Columbia Care will not be modified, prospectively or retroactively, by legislative, judicial or administrative action, in a manner adverse to Columbia Care or its shareholders. 
 Market price of the common shares may be highly volatile. 
 Market prices for cannabis companies have at times been volatile and subject to substantial fluctuations. The stock market, from time-to-time, experiences significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Future announcements concerning Columbia Care or its competitors, including those pertaining to financing arrangements, government regulations, developments concerning regulatory actions affecting Columbia Care, litigation, additions or departures of key personnel, cash flow, and economic conditions and political factors in the United States may have a significant impact on the market price of the Common Shares. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Common Shares will continue to be listed on the Exchanges. 
 The market price of the Common Shares could fluctuate significantly for many other reasons, including as a result of the Arrangement or for reasons unrelated to Columbia Care s specific performance, such as reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions, or negative announcements by its subscribers, competitors or suppliers regarding their own performance, as well as general economic and industry conditions. For example, to the extent that other large companies within its industry experience declines in their stock price, the share price of the Common Shares may decline as well. In addition, when the market price of a company s shares drops significantly, shareholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company. A lawsuit against Columbia Care could cause it to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of its management and other resources. 
 Further equity financing may dilute the interests of Columbia Care shareholders and depress the price of the common shares. 
 If Columbia Care raises additional financing through the issuance of equity securities (including securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities) or completes an acquisition or merger by issuing additional equity securities, such issuance may 
 99 

substantially dilute the interests of shareholders of Columbia Care and reduce the value of their investment. Columbia Care s Articles permit the issuance of an unlimited number of Common Shares, and Columbia Care Shareholders will have no pre-emptive rights in connection with a future issuance. The Board has the discretion to determine the price and the terms of issue of future issuances. Moreover, additional Common Shares may be issued by Columbia Care on the exercise of awards under Columbia Care s Omnibus Plan and upon the exercise of certain outstanding CGGC Warrants (as defined herein). The market price of the Common Shares could decline as a result of issuances of new shares or sales by shareholders of Common Shares in the market or the perception that such sales could occur. Sales by shareholders of Columbia Care might also make it more difficult for Columbia Care itself to sell equity securities at a time and price that it deems appropriate. 
 Conflicts of interest may exist between the Company and its directors or officers. 
 Certain of Columbia Care s directors and officers are, and may continue to be, or may become, involved in other business ventures through their direct and indirect participation in, among other things, corporations, partnerships and joint ventures, that are or may become competitors of the products and services Columbia Care provides or intends to provide. Situations may arise in connection with potential acquisitions or opportunities where the other interests of these directors and officers conflict with or diverge from Columbia Care s interests. In accordance with applicable corporate law, directors who have a material interest in a contract or transaction or a proposed contract or transaction with Columbia Care that is material to Columbia Care are required, subject to certain exceptions, to disclose that interest and generally abstain from voting on any resolution to approve the transaction. In addition, the directors and officers are required to act honestly and in good faith with a view to Columbia Care s best interests. 
 However, in conflict-of-interest situations, Columbia Care s directors and officers may owe the same duty to another company and will need to balance their competing interests with their duties to Columbia Care. Circumstances (including with respect to future corporate opportunities) may arise that may be resolved in a manner that is unfavorable to Columbia Care. 
 
 Certain remedies may be limited. 
 Columbia Care s governing documents may provide that the liability of its members of the Board and its officers is eliminated to the fullest extent permitted under the laws of the Province of British Columbia. Thus, Columbia Care and its Shareholders may be prevented from recovering damages for certain alleged errors or omissions made by the members of the Board and its officers. Columbia Care s governing documents may also provide that Columbia Care will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify members of its Board and its officers for certain liabilities incurred by them by virtue of their acts on behalf of Columbia Care. 
 The anticipated benefits of the Green Leaf Transaction may not occur. 
 Columbia Care may fail to realize growth opportunities and synergies currently anticipated due to, among other things, challenges associated with certain markets Green Leaf Medical operates in and integrating the operations and personnel of Green Leaf Medical into Columbia Care. 
 General Risk Factors 
 The Company is reliant on management. 
 The success of Columbia Care is dependent upon the ability, expertise, judgment, discretion and good faith of its senior management. While employment agreements or management agreements are customarily used as a primary method of retaining the services of key employees, these agreements cannot assure the continued services of such employees. Any loss of the services of such individuals could have a material adverse effect on Columbia Care s business, operating results, financial condition or prospects. 
 The Company may become party to litigation from time to time. 
 Columbia Care is, may become, a party to litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business which could adversely affect its business. Should any litigation in which Columbia Care is or becomes involved be determined against Columbia Care, such a decision could adversely affect Columbia Care s ability to continue operating and the market price for the Common Shares and other listed securities of Columbia Care. Even if Columbia Care is involved in litigation and wins, litigation can redirect significant company resources. Litigation may also create a negative perception of Columbia Care s brand. See Item 3 Legal Proceedings for more information. 
 100 

The Company may be unable to manage its growth effectively. 
 Columbia Care may be subject to growth-related risks including capacity constraints and pressure on its internal systems and controls. The ability of Columbia Care to manage growth effectively will require it to continue to implement and improve its operational and financial systems and to expand, train and manage its employee base. The inability of Columbia Care to deal with this growth may have a material adverse effect on Columbia Care s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 
 The Company is subject to significant costs of being a public company. 
 As a public issuer, Columbia Care is subject to the reporting requirements and rules and regulations under applicable U.S. and Canadian securities laws and the rules of any stock exchange on which Columbia Care s securities may be listed from time to time. Additional or new regulatory requirements may be adopted in the future. The requirements of existing and potential future rules and regulations may increase Columbia Care s legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and may also place undue strain on its personnel, systems and resources, which could adversely affect its business and financial condition. In particular, Columbia Care is subject to reporting and other obligations under applicable U.S. and Canadian securities laws. These reporting and other obligations place significant demands on Columbia Care as well as on Columbia Care s management, administrative, operational and accounting resources. Effective internal controls, including financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, are necessary for Columbia Care to provide reliable financial reports, to effectively reduce the risk of fraud and to operate successfully as a public company. Failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm Columbia Care s results of operations or cause it to fail to meet its reporting obligations. If Columbia Care or its auditors discover a material weakness, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, could reduce the market s confidence in Columbia Care s consolidated financial statements and materially adversely affect the trading price of the Common Shares and of other listed securities of Columbia Care. 
 The trading market for common shares influenced by securities industry analyst research reports. 
 The trading market for Common Shares is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about Columbia Care. If covered, a decision by an analyst to cease coverage of Columbia Care or fail to regularly publish reports on Columbia Care could cause Columbia Care to lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if an analyst who covers Columbia Care downgrades its stock, or if operating results do not meet analysts expectations, the stock price could decline. 
 Past performance may not be indicative of future results. 
 The prior operational performance of Columbia Care is not indicative of any potential future operating results of Columbia Care. There can be no assurance that the historical operating results achieved by Columbia Care or its affiliates will be achieved by Columbia Care, and Columbia Care s future performance may be materially different. 
 Financial projections may prove materially inaccurate or incorrect. 
 Any of Columbia Care s financial estimates, projections and other forward-looking information or statements included herein were prepared by Columbia Care without the benefit of reliable historical industry information or other information customarily used in preparing such estimates, projections and other forward-looking information or statements. Such forward-looking information or statements are based on assumptions of future events that may or may not occur, which assumptions may not be disclosed herein. Investors should inquire of Columbia Care and become familiar with the assumptions underlying any estimates, projections or other forward-looking information or statements. Projections are inherently subject to varying degrees of uncertainty and their achievability depends on the timing and probability of a complex series of future events. There is no assurance that the assumptions upon which these projections are based will be realized. Actual results may differ materially from projected results for a number of reasons including increases in operation expenses, changes or shifts in regulatory rules, undiscovered and unanticipated adverse industry and economic conditions, and unanticipated competition. Accordingly, investors should not rely on any projections to indicate the actual results Columbia Care might achieve. 
 Global financial conditions may have an adverse impact on the Company. 
 Following the onset of the global credit crisis in 2008, global financial conditions were characterized by extreme volatility and several major financial institutions either went into bankruptcy or were rescued by governmental authorities. While global financial conditions subsequently stabilized, there remains considerable risk in the system given the extraordinary measures adopted by government authorities to achieve that stability. Global financial conditions could suddenly and rapidly destabilize in response to future economic shocks, as government authorities may have limited resources to respond to future crises. 
 101 

Future economic shocks may be precipitated by a number of causes, including a rise in the price of oil, geopolitical instability and natural disasters. Any sudden or rapid destabilization of global economic conditions could impact Columbia Care s ability to obtain equity or debt financing in the future on terms favorable to Columbia Care. Additionally, any such occurrence could cause decreases in asset values that are deemed to be other than temporary, which may result in impairment losses. In such an event, Columbia Care s operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. 
 Furthermore, general market, political and economic conditions, including, for example, unemployment levels, inflation, interest and currency exchange rates, structural changes in the cannabis industry, supply and demand for commodities, political developments, legislative or regulatory changes, social or labor unrest and stock market trends will affect Columbia Care s operating environment and its operating costs and profit margins and the price of its securities. Any negative events in the global economy could have a material adverse effect on Columbia Care s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 
 Disease outbreaks may negatively impact the Company. 
 A local, regional, national or international outbreak of a contagious disease, including the novel coronavirus COVID-19, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, H1N1 influenza virus, avian flu or any other similar illness, could decrease the willingness of the general population to travel, cause staff shortages, reduced customer traffic, supply shortages, and increased government regulation all of which may negatively impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company. 
 The risk of a pandemic, or public perception of the risk, could cause customers to avoid public places, including retail properties, and could cause temporary or long-term disruptions in our supply chains and/or delays in the delivery of our inventory. Further, such risks could also adversely affect Columbia Care s customers financial condition, resulting in reduced spending for the merchandise we sell. Moreover, an epidemic, pandemic, outbreak or other public health crisis, such as COVID-19, could cause employees to avoid Company properties, which could adversely affect the Company s ability to adequately staff and manage its businesses. Shelter-in-place or other such orders by governmental entities could also disrupt our operations, if employees who cannot perform their responsibilities from home, are not able to report to work. Risks related to an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis, such as COVID-19, could also lead to the complete or partial closure of one or more of our stores, facilities or operations of the Company s sourcing partners. 
 The ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of such epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis and actions taken to contain or prevent their further spread, among others. These and other potential impacts of an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis, such as COVID-19, could therefore materially and adversely affect Columbia Care s business, financial condition and results of operations.

 ITEM 3. LEGAL PRO CEEDINGS 
 Legal Proceedings 
 The Green Leaf Transaction closed on June 11, 2021. By letters dated April 22, 2022, June 1, 2022 and March 14, 2023, the Company notified the shareholder representative SRS for the former Green Leaf shareholders, including a director of the Company, that the Company was seeking indemnification of approximately 11 million for certain preclosing taxes paid by the Company on behalf of the former Green Leaf shareholders. By letter dated July 14, 2022, SRS notified the Company that the former Green Leaf shareholders were making an indemnification claim to the Company for 17.6 million related to alleged damages arising out of certain alleged undisclosed and under-disclosed litigation matters. By letter dated October 6, 2022, SRS sent an updated demand letter seeking in excess of 75 million from the Company. In addition to the claims raised in SRS s July 14, 2022 letter, SRS demanded payment of at least 58 million for Green Leaf s purported achievement of a milestone payout contemplated in the Green Leaf Transaction for the time period July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022. The Company, based on a third-party assessment, determined that the milestone was not achieved. The parties engaged in preliminary negotiations, including a non-binding mediation, about the possibility of entering into a global resolution of outstanding disputes. On March 2, 2023, SRS filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland against the Company, a Company subsidiary, the Company s Chairman, CEO and CFO, as well as the third-party firm that prepared the aforementioned assessment, seeking in excess of 72 million in damages, in addition to punitive damages, based on asserted legal claims of breach of contract, fraud and intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, tortious interference with a contract, breach of a fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting a breach of a fiduciary duty and civil conspiracy. The Company (and the other named parties) will assert defenses with respect to the claims in the complaint. However, there can be no assurance that such defenses will be successful and, if they are not successful, that the direct or indirect losses will not be material. Separately, the Company intends to continue to pursue legal recourse against the former Green Leaf shareholders with respect to the approximately 11 million owed to the Company for certain preclosing tax payments.

Exchange Controls 
 There are no governmental laws, decrees or regulations in Canada that restrict the export or import of capital, including foreign exchange controls, or that affect the remittance of dividends, interest or other payments to nonresident holders of the securities of the Company, other than Canadian withholding tax. See Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations for Non-Residents of Canada , below. 
 Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations for Non-Residents of Canada 
 The following is, as of the date hereof, a summary of the principal Canadian federal income tax considerations generally applicable under the Income Tax Act (Canada) and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the Tax Act to a holder who acquires, as beneficial owner, our Common Shares, and who, for purposes of the Tax Act and at all relevant times: (i) holds the Common Shares as capital property; (ii) deals at arm s length with, and is not affiliated with, us; (iii) is not, and is not deemed to be resident in Canada; and (iv) does not use or hold and will not be deemed to use or hold, our Common Shares in a business carried on in Canada (a Non-Resident Holder ). Generally, our Common Shares will be considered to be capital property to a Non-Resident Holder provided the Non-Resident Holder does not hold our Common Shares in the course of carrying on a business of trading or dealing in securities and has not acquired them in one or more transactions considered to be an adventure or concern in the nature of trade. Special rules, which are not discussed in this summary, may apply to a Non-Resident Holder that is an insurer that carries on an insurance business in Canada and elsewhere or is an authorized foreign bank (as defined in the Tax Act). Such Non-Resident Holders should seek advice from their own tax advisors . 
 This summary is based upon the provisions of the Tax Act in force as of the date hereof, all specific proposals, or the Proposed Amendments, to amend the Tax Act that have been publicly and officially announced by or on behalf of the Minister of Finance (Canada) prior to the date hereof and management s understanding of the current administrative policies and practices of the Canada Revenue Agency (the CRA published in writing by it prior to the date hereof. This summary assumes the Proposed Amendments will be enacted in the form proposed. However, no assurance can be given that the Proposed Amendments will be enacted in their current form, or at all. This summary is not exhaustive of all possible Canadian federal income tax considerations and, except for the Proposed Amendments, does not take into account or anticipate any changes in the law or any changes in the CRA s administrative 
 106 

policies or practices, whether by legislative, governmental, or judicial action or decision, nor does it take into account or anticipate any other federal or any provincial, territorial or foreign tax considerations, which may differ significantly from those discussed herein. 
 Non-Resident Holders should consult their own tax advisors with respect to an investment in our Common Shares. This summary is of a general nature only and is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax advice to any prospective purchaser or holder of our Common Shares, and no representations with respect to the income tax consequences to any prospective purchaser or holder are made. Consequently, prospective purchasers or holders of our Common Shares should consult their own tax advisors with respect to their particular circumstances. 
 Currency Conversion 
 Generally, for purposes of the Tax Act, all amounts relating to the acquisition, holding, or disposition of our Common Shares must be converted into Canadian dollars based on the exchange rates as determined in accordance with the Tax Act. The amounts subject to withholding tax and any capital gains or capital losses realized by a Non-Resident Holder may be affected by fluctuations in the Canadian-U.S. dollar exchange rate. 
 Disposition of Common Shares 
 A Non-Resident Holder will not generally be subject to tax under the Tax Act on a disposition of a Common Share, unless the Common Share constitutes taxable Canadian property (as defined in the Tax Act) of the Non-Resident Holder at the time of disposition and the Non-Resident Holder is not entitled to relief under an applicable income tax treaty or convention. 
 
 Provided the Common Shares are listed on a designated stock exchange, as defined in the Tax Act at the time of disposition, the Common Shares will generally not constitute taxable Canadian property of a Non-Resident Holder at that time, unless at any time during the 60-month period immediately preceding the disposition the following two conditions are satisfied concurrently: (i) (a) the Non-Resident Holder; (b) persons with whom the Non-Resident Holder did not deal at arm s length; (c) partnerships in which the Non-Resident Holder or a person described in (b) holds a membership interest directly or indirectly through one or more partnerships; or (d) any combination of the persons and partnerships described in (a) through (c), owned 25 or more of the issued shares of any class or series of our shares; and (ii) more than 50 of the fair market value of our shares was derived directly or indirectly from one or any combination of: real or immovable property situated in Canada, Canadian resource properties , timber resource properties (each as defined in the Tax Act), and options in respect of, or interests in or for civil law rights in, such properties (whether or not such property exists). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in certain circumstances set out in the Tax Act, the Common Shares could be deemed to be taxable Canadian property. Even if the Common Shares are taxable Canadian property to a Non-Resident Holder, such Non-Resident Holder may be exempt from tax under the Tax Act on the disposition of such Common Shares by virtue of an applicable income tax treaty or convention. A Non-Resident Holder contemplating a disposition of Common Shares that may constitute taxable Canadian property should consult a tax advisor prior to such disposition. 
 Receipt of Dividends 
 Dividends received or deemed to be received by a Non-Resident Holder on our Common Shares will be subject to Canadian withholding tax under the Tax Act. The general rate of withholding tax is 25 , although such rate may be reduced under the provisions of an applicable income tax convention between Canada and the Non-Resident Holder s country of residence. For example, under the Treaty, the rate is generally reduced to 15 where the Non-Resident Holder beneficially owns such dividends and is a resident of the United States for the purposes of, and is fully entitled to the benefits of, the Treaty. 
 Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities 
 The following information represents securities sold by the Company for the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K which were not registered under the Securities Act. Included are new issues, securities issued upon conversion from other share classes, and securities issued in exchange for property, services, or other securities. 
 February 2022 Private Placement 
 On February 3, 2022, Columbia Care closed the private placement of its 2026 Notes. The 2026 Notes are senior secured obligations of the Company and were issued at 100 of face value. The 2026 Notes accrue interest payable semi-annually in arrears and mature on February 3, 2026, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased. The Company may redeem the 2026 Notes at par, in whole or in part, on or 
 107 

after February 3, 2024, as more particularly described in the fourth supplemental trust indenture governing the 2026 Notes. In connection with the offering of the 2026 Notes, the Company received binding commitments to exchange approximately 31,750,000 of the Company s existing 13 senior secured notes due 2023, pursuant to private agreements in accordance with the trust indenture, for an equivalent amount of 2026 Notes plus accrued but unpaid interest and any negotiated premium thereon. As a result of the note exchanges, the Company received aggregate gross proceeds of 153,250,000 in cash pursuant to the offering of the 2026 Notes. 
 
 The Company sold all of the 2026 Notes pursuant to the exemptions from registration provided by Rule 506(b) and Rule 903. For sales to U.S. persons, the Company relied on Rule 506(b) because (i) there were a limited number of purchasers, (ii) no sales were made by general solicitation or advertising and (iii) sales were made only to accredited investors. For sales outside of the United States, the Company relied on Rule 903 of Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act Rule 903 because the 2026 Notes were offered and sold outside the United States in offshore transactions in accordance with Rule 903. 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 None.

Except for historical information, the discussion in this section contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Future results could differ materially from those discussed below for many reasons, including the risks described in Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, Item 1A-Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Columbia Care s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ). Financial information presented in this MD A is presented in thousands of United States dollars or US ), unless otherwise indicated. 
 OVERVIEW OF COLUMBIA CARE 
 Our principal business activity is the production and sale of cannabis. We strive to be the premier provider of cannabis-related products in each of the markets in which we operate. Our mission is to improve lives by providing cannabis-based health and wellness solutions through community partnerships, research, education and the responsible use of our products as a natural means to improve the quality of life of our patients and customers. 
 COLUMBIA CARE OBJECTIVES AND FACTORS AFFECTING OUR PERFORMANCE 
 As one of the largest fully integrated operators in the global medical cannabis industry, our strategy to grow our business is comprised of the following key components: 
 Expansion and development within and outside our current markets 

Patient and customer-centric, leveraging health and wellness focus 

Consistency and quality of proprietary product portfolio, including branded consumer products 

Intellectual property and data-driven innovation 

Our performance and future success are dependent on several factors. These factors are also subject to inherent risks and challenges, some of which are discussed below. 
 Branding 
 We have established a national branding strategy across each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Maintaining and growing our brand appeal is critical to our continued success. 
 Regulation 
 We are subject to the local and federal laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We hold all required licenses for the production and distribution of our products in the jurisdictions in which we operate and continuously monitor changes in laws, regulations, treaties and agreements. 
 
 Product Innovation and Consumer Trends 
 Our business is subject to changing consumer trends and preferences, which is dependent, in part, on continued consumer interest in new products. The success of new product offerings, depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) accurately anticipate customer needs; (ii) develop new products that meet these needs; (iii) successfully commercialize new products; (iv) price products competitively; (v) produce and deliver products in sufficient volumes and on a timely basis; and (vi) differentiate product offerings from those of competitors. 
 109 

Growth Strategies 
 We have a successful history of growing revenue and we believe we have a strong strategy aimed at continuing our history of expansion in both current and new markets. Our future depends, in part, on our ability to implement our growth strategy including (i) product innovations; (ii) penetration of new markets; (iii) growth of wholesale revenue through third party retailers and distributors; (iv) future development of e-commerce and home delivery distribution capabilities; and (v) expansion of our cultivation and manufacturing capacity. Our ability to implement this growth strategy depends, among other things, on our ability to develop new products that appeal to consumers, maintain and expand brand loyalty, maintain and improve product quality and brand recognition, maintain and improve competitive position in our current markets, and identify and successfully enter and market products in new geographic areas and segments.

Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2021 
 Revenues 
 The increase in revenue of 51,498 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year period was primarily driven by the expansion of our retail network and full year impact of our recent acquisitions. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the prior period we experienced an organic revenue decrease of 5,985 in our Legacy Columbia Care network and prior acquisitions of The Green Solution, Project Cannabis and The Healing Center. Our existing wholesale and retail network contributed to a revenue decrease of 28,241 and the expansion of new wholesale and retail facilities contributed to a revenue growth of 22,256 as compared to the prior period. The full year impact of acquisitions of Cannascend, Corsa Verde, Green Leaf Medical, and Medicine Man contributed to an additional 57,483 of revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the prior period. 
 
 Cost of Sales 
 The increase in cost of sales of 44,302 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year period was primarily driven by the expansion of our retail network and full year impact of our recent acquisitions. 
 During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the prior period we experienced a cost of sales increase of 7,230 due to organic growth which includes our Legacy Columbia Care network as well as full year impact from our acquisitions of The Green Solution, Project Cannabis and The Healing Center. Our existing wholesale and retail network contributed to a cost of sales decrease of 6,218 and the expansion of new wholesale and retail facilities contributed to a cost of sales growth of 13,448 as compared to the prior period. The full year impact of our acquisitions of Cannascend, Green Leaf Medical, and Medicine Man contributed to an additional 37,072 of cost of sales during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the prior period. 
 Gross Profit 
 
 The increase in gross profit of 7,196 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year period was primarily driven by the expansion of our retail network and our recent acquisitions. 
 
 During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we experienced a gross profit decrease of 13,215 when compared to the prior period due to organic decrease in our Legacy Columbia Care network as well as from prior acquisitions of The Green Solution and Project Cannabis and The Healing Center. Our existing wholesale and retail network contributed to a gross profit decrease of 22,023 
 111 

and the expansion of new wholesale and retail facilities contributed to a gross profit growth of 8,808 as compared to the prior period. The full year impact of acquisitions of Cannascend, Green Leaf Medical, and Medicine Man contributed to an additional 20,411 of gross profit during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the prior period. 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 The increase of 313,071 in operating expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in salary and benefits of 18,621, depreciation and amortization of 23,149, an increase in impairment of goodwill of 98,314, an increase in the impairment of intangible assets of 169,479, and an increase in operating facility costs of 11,069, as we expanded our operations and increased the size and scope of our administrative functions. This is offset by decrease in operating office and general expenses of 4,812, professional fees of 2,232, and advertisement and promotion of 2,082. 
 Other Expense (Income), Net 
 
 The increase in other expense (income), net for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to an increase in interest expense on debt of 20,753, increase in amortization of debt issuance costs of 1,923, decrease in gain on remeasurement of contingent consideration of 22,000, a decrease in favorable change in fair value of derivative liability of 6,726 as a result of conversion of convertible debt during the year, other expenses of 6,857, and a loss on restructuring in the amount of 3,089, which is partially offset by acquisition and settlement of pre-existing relationships of 75,655 for the year ended December 31, 2021 which was not incurred in current year, decrease in loss on conversion of convertible notes of 1,580 and increase in rental income of 3,564. 
 Income Tax Benefit and Provisions 
 
 The Company recorded income tax benefit of 11,213 for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to income tax expense of 139 for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 
 The net tax benefit of 11,213 for the year ended December 31, 2022 includes current tax expense of 58,070, deferred tax benefit of 73,609 and change in valuation allowances of 4,326. 
 
 Total provision for income taxes has decreased by 11,352 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in current tax expense is related to an increase in expenses that are not tax deductible under 280E as well as increasing gross profit. The Company is subject to Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code and is forced to disallow costs not attributable to cost of goods sold in its cannabis businesses. The increase in current tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was offset by significant reductions of deferred tax liabilities related to acquisition activity and the impairment thereof. 
 
 Our future financial results are subject to significant potential fluctuations caused by, among other things, growth of sales volume in new and existing markets and our ability to control operating expenses. In addition, our financial results may be impacted significantly by changes to the regulatory environment in which we operate, both on a local, state and federal level. 
 Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2020 
 Revenue 
 
 The increase in revenue of 280,577 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year period was primarily driven by the expansion of our existing wholesale and retail network and our recent acquisitions. Our revenue is predominantly generated by retail sales, which increased 209,877 during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, we experienced a revenue increase of 188,998 due to organic growth which includes our 2020 acquisitions of TGS and Project Cannabis. Our existing wholesale and retail network contributed to revenue growth of 184,637 and the expansion of new wholesale and retail facilities contributed to revenue growth of 4,361 as compared to the prior period. Our acquisitions of The Healing Center, Cannascend, Corsa Verde, Green Leaf Medical and Medicine Man contributed to an additional 91,578 of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year. Revenue increased by 60,625 related to our acquired retail facilities and 30,953 related to our acquired wholesale facilities. 
 Cost of Sales 
 
 112 

The increase in cost of sales of 148,705 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year period was primarily driven by the expansion of our existing wholesale and retail network and our recent acquisitions. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, we experienced a cost of sales increase of 99,403 due to organic growth which includes our 2020 acquisitions of TGS and Project Cannabis. Our existing wholesale and retail network contributed to a cost of sales growth of 94,524 and the expansion of new wholesale and retail facilities contributed to a cost of sales growth of 4,878 as compared to the prior period. Our acquisitions of The Healing Center, Cannascend, Corsa Verde, Green Leaf Medical and Medicine Man contributed to an additional 49,301 of cost of sales during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year. Cost of sales increased by 27,409 related to our acquired retail facilities and 21,892 related to our acquired wholesale facilities. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 
 The increase in gross profit of 131,872 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year period was primarily driven by the expansion of our existing wholesale and retail network and our recent acquisitions. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, we experienced a gross profit increase of 89,595 due to organic growth which includes our 2020 acquisitions of TGS and Project Cannabis. Our existing wholesale and retail network contributed to a gross margin growth of 90,113 coupled with a gross profit loss of 517 as compared to the prior period. Our acquisitions of The Healing Center, Cannascend, Corsa Verde, Green Leaf Medical and Medicine Man contributed to an additional 42,277 of gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year. Gross profit increased by 33,216 related to our acquired retail facilities and 9,061 related to our acquired wholesale facilities. 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 The increase of 162,025 in operating expenses was primarily attributable to impairment charges of 72,328 during the year ended December 31, 2021, and an increase of 89,697 in selling, general and operating expenses, as compared to the prior year period. The increase in selling, general and operating expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in salary and benefits of 38,106, depreciation and amortization of 30,268, operating facility costs of 12,230 and advertising and promotion expenses of 10,172, as we expanded our operations and increased the size and scope of our administrative functions. 
 Other Expense (Income), Net 
 
 The decrease in other expense (income), net for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to a remeasurement of contingent consideration of 81,119 as discussed in our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 and a favorable change in fair value of derivative liability of 25,031 as a result of conversion of Convertible debt during the year, which was partially offset by increase in the acquisition and settlement of pre-existing relationships of 61,460. 
 
 Income Tax Benefit and Provisions 
 
 The Company recorded income tax expense of 139 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to income tax benefit of 16,197 for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 
 The net tax expense of 139 for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes current tax expense of 26,251, deferred tax benefit of 27,942 and change in valuation allowances of 1,830. 
 
 The increase in current tax expense is a direct result of the Company s increasing gross margin. The Company is subject to Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code and is forced to disallow costs not attributable to cost of goods sold in its cannabis businesses. Current tax expense is largely offset by the significant deferred tax liabilities recorded as part of the company s acquisition activity. 
 
 These deferred tax liabilities are exhausted over time with current year activity resulting in deferred tax benefit which reduces overall tax expense 
 
 Our future financial results are subject to significant potential fluctuations caused by, among other things, growth of sales volume in new and existing markets and our ability to control operating expenses. In addition, our financial results may be impacted significantly by changes to the regulatory environment in which we operate, both on a local, state and federal level.

Non-GAAP Measures 
 We use certain non-GAAP measures, referenced in this MD A. These measures are not recognized measures under GAAP and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation from nor as a substitute for our financial information reported under GAAP. We use non-GAAP measures including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin which may be calculated differently by other companies. These non-GAAP measures and metrics are used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and liquidity and thus highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP measures. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented. We also recognize that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-GAAP measures in the evaluation of companies within our industry. Finally, we use non-GAAP measures and metrics in order to facilitate evaluation of operating performance comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of executive compensation.

 The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year period, was primarily driven by improved gross margins offset by increases in facility costs, salary and benefits costs. 
 
 Our future financial results are subject to significant potential fluctuations caused by, among other things, growth of sales volume in new and existing markets and our ability to control operating expenses. In addition, our financial results may be impacted significantly by changes to the regulatory environment in which we operate, both on a local, state and federal level.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements of our business, capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. Historically, we have relied on external financing as our primary source of liquidity. Our ability to fund our operations and to make capital expenditures depends on our ability to successfully secure financing through issuance of debt or equity, as well as our ability to improve our future operating performance and cash flows, which are subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. 
 We are currently meeting our obligations as they become due and are earning revenues from our operations. However, we have sustained losses since inception and may require additional capital in the future. We estimate that based on our current business operations and working capital, we will continue to meet our obligations as they become due. As we continue to seek growth through expansion or acquisition, our cash flows requirements and obligations could materially change. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any significant external capital requirements. 
 Recent Financing Transactions 
 February 2022 Private Placement 
 
 On February 3, 2022, we closed the private placement of 185,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes. The 2026 Notes are senior secured obligations of the Company and were issued at 100.0 of face value. In connection with the offering of the 2026 Notes, the Company received binding commitments to exchange approximately 31,750 of the Company s May 2020 Private Placement Notes, pursuant to private agreements in accordance with the trust indenture, for an equivalent amount of 2026 Notes plus accrued but unpaid interest and any negotiated premium thereon. As a result of the note exchanges, the Company received aggregate gross proceeds of 153,250 in cash pursuant to the offering of the 2026 Notes. 
 Mortgages 
 In December 2021, the Company entered into a term loan and security agreement with a bank. The agreement provides for 20,000 mortgage on real property in New York and carries interest at a variable rate per annum equal to Wall Street prime rate Index plus 2.25 . The debt is repayable in 59 monthly installments and a final balloon payment due on January 1, 2027, which is estimated at 17,999 as of December 31, 2022.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of the date of this filing, we do not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on the results of our operations or financial condition, including, and without limitation, such considerations as liquidity and capital resources. 
 Changes In or Adoption of Accounting Practices 
 The following U.S. GAAP standards have been recently issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. 
 
 In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-01, Investments Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815. The update among other things clarifies that a company should consider observable transactions that require a company to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting under Topic 323, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures, for the purposes of applying the measurement alternative in accordance with Topic 321 immediately before applying or upon discontinuing the equity method. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. We are evaluating the impact of this update on its consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity ASU 2020-06 ), which simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts in an entity s own equity. Among other changes, ASU 2020-06 removes from U.S. GAAP the liability and equity separation model for convertible instruments with a cash conversion feature, and as a result, after adoption, entities will no longer separately present in equity an embedded conversion feature for such debt. Similarly, the embedded conversion feature will no longer be amortized into income as interest expense over the life of the instrument. Instead, entities will account for a convertible debt instrument wholly as debt unless (1) a convertible instrument contains features that require bifurcation as a derivative under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or (2) a convertible debt instrument was issued at a substantial premium. Among other potential impacts, this change is expected to reduce reported interest expense, increase reported net income, and result in a reclassification of certain conversion feature balance sheet amounts from stockholders equity to liabilities as it relates to the Company s convertible senior notes. Additionally, ASU 2020-06 requires the application of the if-converted method to calculate the impact of convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share (EPS), which is consistent with our accounting treatment under the current standard. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and can be adopted on either a fully retrospective or modified retrospective basis. We early adopted the new standard on January 1, 2021. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 We make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the future that affect reported of assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the review affects both current and future periods. 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and revenue and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the review affects both current and future periods. 
 Judgements estimates and assumptions with the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements are described below. 
 Business Combinations 
 We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires us to recognize separately from goodwill, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations. Accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at 
 117 

the acquisition date including estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies, and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain acquired intangible assets under the income approach include growth in future expected cash flows from product sales, customer contracts, revenue growth rate, customer ramp-up period and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. 
 Goodwill 
 Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In the valuation of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows to be derived from our business. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment for these assets. 
 We have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. However, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment tests. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. If the net book value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we would perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of the impairment loss. We perform an annual assessment of our goodwill as of first day of the fourth quarter, or more frequently, to determine if any events or circumstances exist, such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in overall industry demand, that would indicate that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, including goodwill. If events or circumstances do not indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, then goodwill is not considered to be impaired and no further testing is required, if otherwise, we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value, the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, if any, is recognized as an impairment loss. We monitor the indicators for goodwill impairment testing between annual tests. 
 Recoverability of Long-lived Assets 
 We evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived tangible and intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Such trigger events or changes in circumstances may include: a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, including those resulting from technology advancements in the industry, the impact of competition or other factors that could affect the value of a long-lived asset, a significant adverse deterioration in the amount of revenue or cash flows we expect to generate from an asset group, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or development of a long-lived asset, current or future operating or cash flow losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset, or a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. We perform impairment testing at the asset group level that represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable and the expected undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded. Fair value is determined based upon estimated discounted future cash flows. We recognized impairment of 2,000 and 1,969 recognize any impairment loss for long-lived assets for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Assets to be disposed of or held for sale would be separately presented on the balance sheets and reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated or amortized. 
 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
 Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other current liabilities, derivative liability, debt and lease liabilities. The fair values of cash, accounts receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, short-term debt and lease liabilities approximate their carrying values due to the relatively short-term to maturity or because of the market rate of interest used on initial recognition. Columbia Care classifies its derivative liability as fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL). 
 118 

Financial instruments recorded at fair value are classified using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs to fair value measurements. The three levels of contained within the hierarchy are: 
 Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
 Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and 
 Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. 
 Our assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include investments, assets and liabilities held for sale, long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We review the carrying amounts of such assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable or at least annually, for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Any resulting asset impairment would require that the asset be recorded at its fair value. The resulting fair value measurements of the assets are considered Level 3 measurements.

ITEM 7A. 	 QUANTITATI VE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 Financial Risk Management 
 The Company is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks. The Board mitigates these risks by assessing, monitoring and approving the Company s risk management processes. 
 Credit Risk 
 Credit risk is the risk of a potential loss to the Company if a customer or third party to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Company does not have significant credit risk with respect to its customers. 
 The Company provides credit to its customers in the normal course of business. The Company has established credit evaluation and monitoring processes to mitigate credit risk but has limited risk as the majority of its sales are paid at the time of sale. 
 Liquidity Risk 
 Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations associated with financial liabilities. The Company manages liquidity risk through the effective management of its capital structure. The Company s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity at all times to settle obligations and liabilities when due. 
 Market Risk 
 Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange, raw material and other commodity prices. 
 Currency Risk . The operating results and financial position of the Company are reported in U.S. dollars. Some of the Company s financial transactions are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The results of the Company s operations are subject to currency transaction risks. The Company has no hedging agreements in place with respect to foreign exchange rates. The Company has not entered into any agreements or purchased any instruments to hedge possible currency risks at this time. 
 Interest Rate Risk . Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. Cash and cash equivalents bear interest at market rates. The Company s senior secured financial debts have fixed rates of interest and therefore expose the Company to a limited interest rate fair value risk. 
 Commodities Price Risk . Commodities Price risk is the risk of variability in fair value due to movements in equity or market prices. The primary raw materials used by the Company aside from those cultivated internally are labels and packaging. Management believes a hypothetical 10 change in the price of these materials would not have a significant effect on the Company s consolidated annual results of operations or cash flows, as these costs are generally passed through to its customers. However, such an increase could have an impact on our customers demand for our products, and we are not able to quantify the impact of such potential change in demand on our combined annual results of operations or cash flows.

 ITEM 9A. CO NTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 a. Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

Management of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the year covered by this Form 10-K. The term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures established by the Company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Based upon their evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as of December 31, 2022, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period ended December 31, 2022, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. In its evaluation effective as of December 31, 2021 management concluded that disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. This item was remediated during 2022 as discussed below. 
 Evaluation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting Under Canadian Law as of December 31, 2021 
 As a newly reporting company in the United States, the Company was subject to a transition period related to management s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting. However, as a public company in Canada, the Company undertook an analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers Annual and Interim Filings. 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 Based on this evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, relating to the lack of appropriate controls over management s fair value modeling of complex accounting and financial reporting issues in the impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets. 
 The material weakness related to a lack of certain controls, or improper execution of designed control procedures for review of complex accounting and financial reporting issues. 
 
 The combination of control deficiencies that resulted in these material weaknesses were related to insufficient resources to properly execute the designed controls or perform an effective review over certain manual controls related to the financial statement close process. In addition, certain control deficiencies related to the timely review of transactions that were infrequent in nature. 
 In response to the material weakness described above, the Company implemented a remediation plan to address the material weakness. Based on this remediation and our ongoing evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 121 

The Company, including its CEO and CFO, does not expect that its internal controls and procedures will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived or operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. 
 b. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Based upon their evaluation of the Company s controls over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2022, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our controls over financial reporting as of the end of the period ended December 31, 2022, as required by paragraph (c) of 240.13a-15 or 240.15d-15 of this chapter. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) to conduct the required assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report, our controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 c. Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm 

This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered independent public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered independent public accounting firm as the Company qualifies as an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Start-ups Act of 2012. 
 d. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 

There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION 
 In May 2020, the Company completed the May 2020 Private Placement, a concurrent brokered and non-brokered private placement of the May 2020 Private Placement Units for gross proceeds of US 19,115,000. Each May 2020 Private Placement Unit was comprised of: (i) the May 2020 Private Placement Notes, US 1,000 principal amount of 13.00 senior secured first-lien notes; and (ii) 120 May 2020 Private Placement Warrants. 
 The May 2020 Private Placement Notes are governed by the terms of the May 2020 Trust Indenture dated May 14, 2020 between the Company and Odyssey Trust Company, as trustee.

R EPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Shareholders and Directors of 
 Columbia Care Inc. 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Columbia Care Inc. and its subsidiaries (together the Company as of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2019.

 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 (expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for gram, share and per share amounts) 
 of a subordinate voting share of Cresco Labs (each whole share, a Cresco Labs Share for each Company common share (or equivalent) held, subject to adjustment, representing a total consideration enterprise value of approximately US billion based on the closing price of Cresco Labs Shares on the CSE as of March 22, 2022. After giving effect to the Cresco Transaction, Company Shareholders will hold approximately of the pro forma Cresco Labs Shares (on a fully diluted in-the-money, treasury method basis). 
), and ), respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 the Company had cash flows used in operating activities of ), and ), respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had working capital of and ), respectively. Current management forecasts and related assumptions support the view that the Company can adequately manage the operational needs of the business with the current cash on hand for the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. 
 
 The Company generally accounts for investments it makes in VIEs in which it has determined that it does not have a controlling financial interest but has significant influence over and holds at least a ownership interest using the equity method. Any such investment not meeting the parameters to be accounted under the equity method would be accounted for using the cost method unless the investment had a readily determinable fair value, at which it would then be reported. Investments in unconsolidated VIEs are recorded in non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Income from affiliates is immaterial for the period presented. If an entity fails to meet the characteristics of a VIE, the Company then evaluates such entity under the voting model. Under the voting model, the Company consolidates the entity if they determine that they, directly or indirectly, have greater than 50 of the voting shares, and determines that other equity holders do not have substantive participating rights. The Company assesses annually whether there is any objective evidence that its interest in associates is impaired. If impaired, the carrying value of the Company s share of the underlying assets of associates is written down to its estimated recoverable amount (being the higher of fair value less costs of disposal, or value in use) and charged to the consolidated 
 
 of the consolidated revenues. Revenue earned outside of the United States of America is immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. Long-lived assets located outside of the United States of America are immaterial as on December 31, 2022 and 2021.

The assets residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted prospectively if appropriate. Construction in progress is measured at cost and reflects amounts incurred for property or equipment construction or improvements that have not been placed in service. Upon completion, construction in progress will be reclassified as building or leasehold improvements depending on the nature of the assets and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. An item of equipment is de-recognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising from derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying value of the asset) is included in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss in the year the asset is de-recognized. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the terms of the leases when placed in service.

The estimated useful lives, residual values and amortization methods are reviewed at each year-end, and any changes in estimates are accounted for prospectively. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination. The Company defines each state in which it operates as its reporting unit. Goodwill is allocated to each identified reporting unit, which is the state (one level below the operating segment). Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or more often, if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. This includes but is not limited to significant adverse changes in the business climate, market conditions, or other events that indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. 
 for each reporting unit using the income approach, when available and appropriate, the market approach, or a combination of both. The income approach involves forecasting projected financial information (such as revenue growth rates, profit margins, tax rates, working capital and capital expenditures) and selecting a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in estimated future cash flows. Under the market approach, the fair value is based on observed market data. If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately. The Company performs an annual assessment of its goodwill as of October 1, or more frequently, to determine if any events or circumstances exist, such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in overall industry demand, that would indicate that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, including goodwill.

Irrespective of indemnification clauses pertaining to unrecognized tax benefits related to the Company s acquisitions, the Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax expense.

The Company recognizes revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for the performance obligations. Revenue is recorded net of discounts and unearned revenue from the Company s loyalty programs. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company netted discounts of , , and , respectively, against the revenues. Discounts are provided by the Company during promotional days or weekends. Discounts are also provided to employees, seniors and other categories of customers and may include price reductions and coupons. Variable consideration is estimated in the transaction price at contract inception based on current sales levels and historical experience using the expected value method, subject to constraint. Payment is typically due upon transferring the goods to the customer or within a specified time period permitted under the Company s credit policy. Sales taxes collected from customers are remitted to the appropriate taxing jurisdictions as they become due, and are excluded from sales revenue as the Company considers itself a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting sales taxes. Freight revenues on all product sales, when applicable, are also recognized, on a consistent manner, at a point in time. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant and the period between when the entity transfers the promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service is one year or less. The Company generates an immaterial amount of revenue from services such as management fee revenues and interest on overdue amounts on the Columbia Care s National Credit card CNC Cards ). Management fee revenue is recognized over time as the recipient of management services derives value from the services provided. The interest on overdue amounts on the CNC Cards is recognized as interest income over time. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company earned a revenue of and from the CNC program. These revenues are included in the retail revenues mentioned above. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, in connection with the revenues generated from the CNC card, the Company has accounts receivable of and , net of an allowance of bad debts of and . These receivables are included within the line item on the consolidated balance sheets. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred expenses of and in connection with the administration of the CNC program. These expenses are included within the selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Interest on overdue amounts on the CNC card is immaterial. Loyalty Points Reward Programs In certain of its markets, the Company offers a loyalty reward program to its dispensary customers. The Company offers its customers loyalty points rewards program that allows its customers to earn discounts on future purchases. Loyalty points are earned when a qualifying purchase is made. When a customer attains a certain number of points, the customer can redeem the credits on his/her next in-store purchase, up to a certain annual minimum. Loyalty points not redeemed expire automatically after six months from the date which they were earned. A portion of the revenue generated in a sale is allocated to the loyalty points earned. The amount allocated to the points earned is deferred until the loyalty points are redeemed or expire. Deferred Income Deferred income represents cash payments received in advance of the Company s transfer of control of products or services to its customers and generally consists of unearned revenue from the Company s loyalty programs. The Company s deferred income balances were and as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and were recorded within accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized as net revenue from amounts recorded as deferred income in prior periods. During the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020 the company recognized and respectively as net revenues from amounts recorded as deferred income in prior periods. The deferred income balance as of December 31, 2022 is expected to be recognized as revenue within the next twelve months. 

The Company follows the guidance in FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , or ASC 820, which defines fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: Level 1 Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. In estimating fair value, the Company uses market-observable data to the extent it is available. In certain cases where Level 1 inputs are not available the Company may engage third party qualified valuers to perform the valuation. To the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. A financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity specific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Company s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The Company uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market dislocation. In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. In estimating fair value, the Company uses market-observable data to the extent it is available. In certain cases where Level 1 inputs are not available the Company may engage third-party qualified valuers to perform the valuation. This condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2 or Level 2 to Level 3. A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument to another entity. Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets at the time the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. Initial measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value upon initial recognition plus any directly attributable transaction costs when not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. Subsequent measurement Measurement in subsequent periods is dependent on the classification of the financial instrument. The Company classifies its financial instruments in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held to maturity, available for sale, and other financial liabilities. The Company s Level 3 financial instruments include the derivative liability associated with the convertible note payable issued to stockholders (see Note 5). 

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes . The update contains a number of provisions intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted the guidance in Topic 740 beginning January 1, 2021. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-01, Investments Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815. The update among other things clarifies that a company should consider observable transactions that require a company to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting under Topic 323, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures, for the purposes of applying the measurement alternative in accordance with Topic 321 immediately before applying or upon discontinuing the equity method. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. The Company is evaluating the impact of this update on its consolidated financial statements. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity ASU 2020-06 ), which simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts in an entity s own equity. Among other changes, ASU 2020-06 removes from U.S. GAAP the liability and equity separation model for convertible instruments with a cash conversion feature, and as a result, after adoption, entities will no longer separately present in equity an embedded conversion feature for such debt. Similarly, the embedded conversion feature will no longer be amortized into income as interest expense over the life of the instrument. Instead, entities will account for a convertible debt instrument wholly as debt unless (1) a convertible instrument contains features that require bifurcation as a derivative under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or (2) a convertible debt instrument was issued at a substantial premium. Among other potential impacts, this change is expected to reduce reported interest expense, increase reported net income, and result in a reclassification of certain conversion feature balance sheet amounts from stockholders equity to liabilities as it relates to the Company s convertible senior notes. Additionally, ASU 2020-06 requires the application of the if-converted method to calculate the impact of convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share (EPS), which is consistent with the Company s accounting treatment under the current standard. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and can be adopted on either a fully retrospective or modified retrospective basis. The Company early adopted the new standard on January 1, 2021. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 

 Accounting pronouncements not yet adopted In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848. This update defers the Sunset Date of ASC Topic 848, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), which provides temporary optional relief in accounting for the impact of Reference Rate Reform. This updated is effective upon issuance and generally can be applied through December 31, 2024. The Company is evaluating the impact of this update on its consolidated financial statements . 
 
 (4) The reporting unit s fair value is determined using discounted future cash flow models, which incorporate assumptions regarding future events, specifically future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. (5) Stock-based compensation The fair value of stock-based compensation expenses is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and rely on a number of assumptions including the fair value of common shares on the grant date, risk-free rate, volatility rate, annual dividend yield, the expected term, and the estimated rate of forfeiture of options granted. Volatility is estimated by using the historical volatility of the Company. (6) Convertible debentures The fair value of Convertible Debentures where the Company had elected the fair value option are determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Assumptions and estimates are made in determining an appropriate conversion price, volatility, dividend yield, and the fair value of common stock. There is judgement in assessing what portion of the gain or loss, if any, relates to the change in the instrument-specific credit risk. 

, (the Acquisition Date the Company completed the merger. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, CGGC acquired of the issued and outstanding ownership interests of Columbia Care LLC in exchange for the issuance of common shares and proportionate voting shares in the capital of CGGC. Prior to the Merger, CGGC consolidated its common shares on a one for three basis and changed its name to Columbia Care Inc. Following the Merger, Columbia Care LLC became a single-member partnership, wholly owned by the Company. While CGGC was the legal acquirer of Columbia Care LLC, the RTO has been treated as a reverse asset acquisition and consequently Columbia Care LLC was identified as the acquirer for accounting purposes. The RTO was measured at the fair value of the shares deemed to have been issued by Columbia Care LLC in order for the ownership interest in the combined entity to be the same as if the transaction had taken the legal form of Columbia Care LLC acquiring of CGGC. Any difference between the fair value of the shares deemed to have been issued by Columbia Care LLC and the fair value of CGGC s identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed represents the value of the public listing received by Columbia Care LLC and was debited to equity.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company expensed in listing costs.

Volatility was estimated by using the average historical volatility of comparable companies from a representative peer group of publicly traded cannabis companies. The Company evaluated the warrants issued as a part of the purchase consideration under ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity and ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity. These warrants do not have a redemption feature and are traded separately from our common shares on the NEO exchange. They can be converted into shares, on a one-for-one conversion ratio prior to their expiry on April 26, 2024, upon payment of a fixed exercise price of (Canadian Dollars) per warrant by the warrant holder. The settlement amount is subject to change in case of certain situations like future stock split, consolidation, stock dividend etc. These variables that could affect the settlement amount would be inputs to the fair value of a fixed-for-fixed forward or option on equity shares. As the Company early adopted the provisions of ASU 2017-11 in 2018, the value of the down round provision associated with a future rights issue would be recognized only when it is activated and there is an actual reduction of the strike price or conversion feature. The Company determined that these warrants are freestanding financial instruments that qualify for the scope exemption for being accounted as derivatives. Further, the warrant agreement does not prohibit settlement in unregistered shares and it does not contain any cash-settled top-off or make-whole provisions or provisions for cash payment by the Company in case it fails to file with the SEC. The Company has an unlimited number of authorized shares and it is not required to post a collateral at any point with respect to the warrant agreement. The rights of the warrant holders do not rank higher than the rights of the shareholders. The Company therefore concluded that the warrants meet the criteria to be classified in stockholders equity and should be measured at fair value on the date of RTO. No changes would be required to the measurement amount or the classification unless an event that requires a reclassification of the warrants out of the equity occurs. The Company reassessed the contract classification as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, noting no changes to the classification and / or measurement. The Company formally became an SEC registrant with the filing of its 2021 Form 10-K.

The principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the conversion price are denominated in U.S. dollars. As the functional currency of the Company is Canadian dollars, the amount of the liability to be settled depends on the applicable foreign exchange rate on the date of settlement. The 2025 Convertible Notes therefore represent an obligation to issue a fixed number of shares for a variable amount of liability. Due to this conversion feature within the 2025 Convertible Notes, the Company is unable to obtain an exception from derivative accounting. Accordingly, this conversion feature was accounted for as an embedded derivative liability and measured at fair value of on the date of issuance of debt with a corresponding debt discount, reflected as a reduction to the carrying value of the Convertible Notes.

In accordance with ASC 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity , a conversion feature within a financial instrument to issue a variable number of equity units fails to meet the definition of equity. Accordingly, such a conversion feature must be accounted for as an embedded derivative liability and measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Upon initial recognition, the Company recorded a derivative liability of within other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and a corresponding debt discount, reflected as a reduction to the carrying value of the Convertible Notes.

The Company operates in the legal cannabis industry but is subject to Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code IRC which prohibits the Company from deducting non cost of goods sold related expenses. Section 280E was originally intended to penalize criminal market operators, but because cannabis remains a Schedule I controlled substance for Federal purposes, the IRS has subsequently applied Section 280E to state-legal cannabis businesses. Cannabis businesses operating in states that align their tax codes with the IRC are also unable to deduct normal business expenses from their state taxes. The result of Section 280E s application to the Company results in permanent disallowance of ordinary and necessary business expenses. As a result of 280E the Company s effective tax rate can be highly variable and may not necessarily correlate with pre-tax income or loss. The non-deductible expenses shown in the effective rate reconciliation above is comprised primarily of the impact of applying IRC Sec. 280E to the Company s businesses that are involved in selling cannabis, along with other permanent tax adjustments as prescribed by relevant tax code.

and for the years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, respectively. Indemnification agreements In the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to vendors, lessors, business partners, and other parties with respect to certain matters including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with members of its board of directors and senior management that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is, in many cases, unlimited. Other than the accruals mentioned in this note, the Company has not accrued any liabilities related to any pending claims potentially subject to any indemnifications in its consolidated financial statements. The Green Leaf Transaction closed on June 11, 2021. By letters dated April 22, 2022, June 1, 2022 and March 14, 2023, the Company notified the shareholder representative SRS for the former Green Leaf shareholders, including a director of the Company, that the Company was seeking indemnification of approximately million for certain preclosing taxes paid by the Company on behalf of the former Green Leaf shareholders. By letter dated July 14, 2022, SRS notified the Company that the former Green Leaf shareholders were making an indemnification claim to the Company for million related to alleged damages arising out of certain alleged undisclosed and under-disclosed litigation matters. By letter dated October 6, 2022, SRS sent an updated demand letter seeking in excess of million from the Company. In addition to the claims raised in SRS s July 14, 2022 letter, SRS demanded payment of at least million for Green Leaf's purported achievement of a milestone payout contemplated in the Green Leaf Transaction for the time period July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022. The Company, based on a third-party assessment, determined that the milestone was not achieved. The parties engaged in preliminary negotiations, including a non-binding mediation, about the possibility of entering into a global resolution of outstanding disputes. On March 2, 2023, SRS filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland against the Company, a Company subsidiary, the Company s Chairman, CEO and CFO, as well as the third-party firm that prepared the aforementioned assessment, seeking in excess of million in damages, in addition to punitive damages , based on asserted legal claims of breach of contract, fraud and intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, tortious interference with a contract, breach of a fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting a breach of a fiduciary duty and civil conspiracy. The Company (and the other named parties) will assert defenses with respect to the claims in the complaint. However, there can be no assurance that such defenses will be successful and, if they are not successful, that the direct or indirect losses will not be material. Separately, the Company intends to continue to pursue legal recourse against the former Green Leaf shareholders with respect to the approximately million owed to the Company for certain preclosing tax payments. Additionally, the Company may be contingently liable with respect to other claims incidental to the ordinary course of its operations. In the opinion of management, and based on management s consultation with legal counsel, the ultimate outcome of such other matters will not have a materially adverse effect on the Company. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these consolidated financial statements for losses, if any, which might result from the ultimate disposition of these matters should they arise.

During the period included in these financial statements, there were transfers of amounts between levels. For fair value measurements of assets and liabilities that are done on a non-recurring basis, refer to Note 20. The following table summarizes the valuation techniques and key inputs used in the fair value measurement of level 3 financial instruments:

 The carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, current portion of long-term debt and lease liability as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these items and are not included in the table above. The Company s other long-term payables, long-term debt and lease liabilities approximate fair value due to the market rate of interest used on initial recognition. In addition to the disclosures for assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value at the balance sheet date, companies are required to disclose the estimated fair values of all financial instruments, even if they are not presented at their fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of financial instruments are estimates based upon market conditions and perceived risks as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. These estimates require management s judgment and may not be indicative of the future fair values of the assets and liabilities. Financial assets and liabilities for which the carrying values approximate their fair values include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable included within prepaid expenses and other assets, and accrued liabilities and other payables. Generally, these assets and liabilities are short term in duration and their carrying value approximates fair value on the consolidated balance sheets.

The carrying value of goodwill in each reporting unit is indicative of the expected growth and development of the business. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company identified qualitative indicators of impairment as a result of a strategic reassessment of its business, including an evaluation of current operations and its future growth outlook due to changing consumer trends within certain markets. The decision to reduce the long-term growth outlook resulted in a downward adjustment of the future financial forecasts for the Company s Green Leaf Medical and Colorado businesses, which indicated that impairment of the goodwill asset was a more-likely-than-not outcome. 

Discount rate 

Terminal value multiple / rate 

The recoverable amount of the reporting unit to which goodwill is allocated and the asset group to which intangibles are allocated were determined based on fair value using Level 3 inputs in a discounted cash flow analysis. Management tested the Colorado, California, and gLeaf (mostly Pennsylvania) asset groups for the definite lived assets impairment. The Company determined that the California reporting unit was not impaired and supported this assumption through use of revenue market multiples. In addition, the Company uses its market capitalization and comparative market multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results. The significant assumptions applied in the determination of the recoverable amount are described below: i. Cash flows: Estimated cash flows were projected based on actual operating results from internal sources as well as industry and market trends. Estimated cash flows are primarily driven by sales volumes, selling prices and operating costs. The forecasts are extended to a total of five years (and a terminal year thereafter); ii. Terminal value growth rate: The terminal growth rate was based on historical and projected consumer price inflation, historical and projected economic indicators, and projected industry growth; iii. Corporate overhead allocation and the eventual reappeal of Schedule 208E. iv. Post-tax discount rate: The post-tax discount rate is reflective of the reporting unit s Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC ). The WACC was estimated based on the risk-free rate, equity risk premium, beta adjustment to the equity risk premium based on a direct comparison approach, an unsystematic risk premium, and after-tax cost of debt based on corporate bond yields; and v. Tax rate: The tax rates used in determining the future cash flows were those substantively enacted at the respective valuation date. There was impairment in the Company s California Reporting Unit and record ed as impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets of its Green Leaf (primarily Pennsylvania) and Colorado Reporting Units. The Company separately performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the changes in the fair value of goodwill and intangibles that would result from changes in certain assumptions, including cash flows and discount rate. The Company performed the aforementioned sensitivity analyses as follows: 

 o If revenues for all years were to decrease 10 

 o If EBITDA is reduced by 5 each year 

 o If the discount rate changes +2 and +5 

 In addition, the Company ran a sensitivity on the terminal value multiple as well: 

 o If the terminal value multiple is reduced -2 and -5 

 These changes would result in material adjustments to the goodwill and intangible amounts for Colorado and Green Leaf in these scenarios. Impairment 2021 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company identified qualitative indicators of impairment as a result of a strategic reassessment of its business, including an evaluation of current operations and its future growth outlook due to changing consumer trends within certain markets. This resulted in a downward adjustment of the future financial forecasts for the Company s Colorado, California and Pennsylvania businesses, which indicated that impairment of the goodwill asset was a more-likely-than-not outcome. The recoverable amount of the reporting unit to which goodwill is allocated and the asset group to which intangibles are allocated were determined based on fair value using Level 3 inputs in a discounted cash flow analysis.

The Company will continue to monitor the impact of the goodwill associated with this reporting unit, and should it suffer additional declines in actual or forecasted financial results, the risk of goodwill impairment would increase. 

 During 2022, in conjunction with the proposed transaction with Cresco Labs, the Company committed to a plan to sell parts of its operations in Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Ohio and New York. The divestiture of the Assets is required for Cresco to close its previously announced acquisition of Columbia Care. On November 4, 2022 the Company and Cresco jointly announced the signing of definitive agreements to divest certain New York, Illinois, and Massachusetts assets to an entity owned and controlled by Sean Diddy Combs (the Combs Transaction ). Accordingly, certain of the Company's long-lived assets and liabilities held in these three markets were presented as a disposal group held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company reassessed the fair value of these net assets held for sale and deemed that no adjustment was necessary. An assessment was separately made by the Company on the treatment of short-lived assets and liabilities in these three markets. On the basis the current assets and liabilities associated with the Combs Transaction are likely to turn over prior to consummation and that the final purchase price is dependent on net working capital balances as at the date of closing of the transaction, and as such undeterminable as at year end, it was determined these should not be reclassified to assets and liabilities held for sale. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company committed to a plan to sell its Puerto Rico operations. Accordingly, certain of the assets and liabilities held by the Company s Puerto Rico subsidiary were presented as a disposal group held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company reassessed the fair value of the net assets held for sale and deemed that the same was negligible. Accordingly, the Company wrote down to , the fair value of the net assets held for sale. Additionally, as of December 31, 2021, certain of the Company s assets were classified as held for sale. See Note 6 for further details. Impairment losses of and for write-downs of the disposal group to the lower of its carrying amount and its fair value less costs to sell have been included in other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. These planned disposals did not represent a strategic shift of the Company that had or will have a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results. Accordingly, the operations were not segregated and were presented as continuing operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

For purposes of this Agreement, Affiliated Entity means, with respect to the Indemnitee, any investment fund, institutional investor, management company, managed account or other financial intermediary which employs or engages, or is affiliated with, the Indemnitee, to whom Indemnitee provides services, or in whom Indemnitee has a direct or indirect equity or similar interest. 

Article 4 : DENIAL OF INDEMNIFICATION 

4.1 If indemnification under this Agreement is not paid in full by the Company within thirty (30) days after a written claim therefor has been received by it and the applicable approval of the Court has been obtained where required, whichever is later, the Indemnitees may any time thereafter bring suit against the Company to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if wholly successful on the merits or otherwise or substantially successful on the merits, the Indemnitees will also be entitled to be paid all Expenses incurred in connection with the prosecution of such claim including, for greater certainty, legal fees (including reasonable disbursements) as between solicitor and own client on a full indemnity basis. It will be a defence to any such action that the Indemnified Party has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under this Agreement, the Business Corporations Act or applicable law for the Company to indemnify the Indemnitees for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defence will be on the Company. 

- 15 - 
 Article 5 : CONDUCT OF DEFENCE 

5.1 Promptly after receiving notice from any of the Indemnitees of any proceeding identified in Section 3.1, the Company may, and upon the written request of the Indemnitees will, promptly assume conduct of the defence thereof and, at the Company's expense, retain counsel on behalf of the Indemnitees who is satisfactory to the Indemnitees, acting reasonably, to represent the Indemnitees in respect of the proceeding. If the Company assumes conduct of the defence on behalf of the Indemnitees, the Indemnified Party hereby consents to the conduct thereof and to any action taken by the Company, in good faith, in connection therewith and the Indemnified Party will fully cooperate in such defence including, without limitation, providing documents, attending examinations for discovery, making affidavits, meeting with counsel, testifying and divulging to the Company all information reasonably required to defend or prosecute the proceeding. 

5.2 In connection with any proceeding in respect of which the Indemnitees may be entitled to be indemnified hereunder, the Indemnitees will have the right to employ separate counsel of their choosing and to participate in the defence thereof but the legal fees and disbursements of such counsel will be at the sole expense of the Indemnitees unless: 

(a) the Indemnitees reasonably determine that there are legal defences available to the Indemnitees that are different from or in addition to those available to the Company or any Affiliate, as the case may be, or that a conflict of interest exists which makes representation by counsel chosen by the Company not advisable; 

(b) the Company has not assumed the defence of the proceeding and employed counsel therefor satisfactory to the Indemnitees, acting reasonably, within a reasonable period of time after receiving notice thereof; or 

(c) employment of such other counsel has been authorized in writing by the Company; 

in which event the reasonable legal fees and disbursements of such counsel will be paid by the Company, subject to the terms hereof. In any such proceeding, the Company will fully cooperate in the defence of the Indemnitees including, without limitation, providing documents and causing its representatives to attend examinations for discovery, make affidavits, meet with counsel and testify and divulge all information in the Company s possession reasonably required to defend or prosecute the proceeding. 
 Article 6 : SETTLEMENT 

6.1 The Company may, with the prior written consent of the Indemnitees (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), enter into a settlement or other agreement to settle or compromise a proceeding. In seeking such consent, the Company will provide the Indemnitees with a reasonable period of time, in light of the circumstances, to consider the terms of a proposed settlement. 

6.2 If the Indemnitees refuse after being requested by the Company to give consent to the terms of a proposed settlement which is otherwise acceptable to the Company, acting reasonably, the Company cannot settle but may require the Indemnitees to negotiate or defend the proceeding 

- 16 - 
 independently of the Company at the Indemnitees expense. In such event any amount recovered by the claimant in excess of the amount for which settlement could have been made by the Company shall not be recoverable under this Agreement or otherwise, it being further agreed by the parties that in such event the Company shall only be responsible for Expenses up to the time at which such settlement could have been made. 

6.3 The Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

6.4 The Indemnitees shall have the right to negotiate a settlement in respect of any proceeding, provided, however, that in such circumstances, unless the Company approves such settlement, the Indemnitees shall pay any compensation, Expenses or other payment to be made under the settlement and the Expenses of negotiating and implementing the settlement, and shall not seek indemnity from the Company in respect of such compensation, Expenses or other payment. 

Article 7 : COURT APPROVAL 

7.1 In the event of any claim for indemnification or payment of Expenses with respect to a proceeding brought against an Indemnitee by or on behalf of the Company or an Affiliate, provided that the Indemnified Party has fulfilled the conditions set forth in paragraphs 3.1(c) and 3.1(d) of Section 3.1, the Company will with best efforts apply to the Court for an order approving the indemnification of, or payment of Expenses to, the Indemnitees. 

Article 8 : NO PRESUMPTIONS AS TO ABSENCE OF GOOD FAITH 

8.1 Termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, or similar or other result, will not, of itself, create any presumption for the purposes of this Agreement that the Indemnified Party did not act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the Company or an Affiliate, as the case may be, or, in the case of a proceeding other than a civil proceeding, that he/she did not have reasonable grounds for believing that his/her conduct was lawful (unless the judgment or order of a court or another tribunal of competent jurisdiction specifically finds otherwise). Neither the failure of the Company (including the Board, its independent legal counsel or its shareholders) to have made a determination that indemnification of the Indemnitees is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnified Party has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Company (including the Board, its independent legal counsel or its shareholders) that the Indemnified Party has not met such applicable standard of conduct, will be a defence to any action brought by the Indemnitees against the Company to recover the amount of any indemnification claim, nor create a presumption that the Indemnified Party has not met the applicable standard of conduct. 

8.2 For purposes of any determination under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party will be deemed, subject to compelling evidence to the contrary, to have acted in good faith and in the best interests of the Company or any Affiliate. The Company will have the burden of establishing the absence of good faith. 

- 17 - 
 8.3 The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any other director, officer, agent or employee of the Company or any Affiliate will not be imputed to the Indemnified Party for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement. 

Article 9 : RESIGNATION 

9.1 Nothing in this Agreement will prevent or restrict the Indemnified Party from, at any time, changing his/her title or position within the Company or any Affiliate or from resigning as a director or an officer of the Company or any Affiliate. The Company and any Affiliate will have no obligation under this Agreement to continue the Indemnified Party as a director or an officer. 

Article 10 : DEATH 

10.1 For greater certainty, if the Indemnified Party is deceased and is or becomes entitled to indemnification under any of the provisions of this Agreement, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Party's estate and the Indemnitees to the same extent as it would indemnify the Indemnified Party, if alive, hereunder. 

Article 11 : OTHER RIGHTS AND REMEDIES 

11.1 The indemnification provided for in this Agreement will not derogate from, exclude or reduce any other rights or remedies, in law or in equity, to which the Indemnitees may be entitled by operation of law or under any statute, rule, regulation or ordinance or by virtue of any available insurance coverage, including, but not limited to, the following: 

(a) the Business Corporations Act; 

(b) the constating documents of the Company or an Affiliate; 

(c) any vote of the shareholders or disinterested directors of the Company or an Affiliate; or 

(d) any applicable insurance policies of the Company, 

both as to matters arising out of the capacity of the Indemnified Party as a director or an officer of the Company or an Affiliate or as to matters arising out of another capacity with the Company or an Affiliate, while being a director or an officer of the Company or an Affiliate, or as to matters arising by reason of his/her being or having been at the request of the Company, a director, officer or employee of any other legal entity of which the Company is or was an equity owner or creditor. 
 Article 12 : NOTICE OF PROCEEDING 

12.1 The Indemnitees agree to give written notice to the Company as soon as reasonably practicable after being served with any statement of claim, writ, notice of motion, indictment or other document commencing or continuing any proceedings against the Indemnitees as a party. Any failure of the Indemnitees to give notice as herein provided shall not derogate from, exclude or reduce any of the rights or remedies, to which the Indemnitees are entitled to pursuant to any of the provisions of this Agreement, provided the Company has not suffered any actual damage from the failure of the Indemnitees to give notice as herein provided. 

- 18 - 
 12.2 If the Company receives notice from any other source of any matter of which the Indemnitees would otherwise be obligated hereunder to give notice to the Company, then the Indemnitees will be relieved of the obligation hereunder to give notice to the Company, provided that the Company has not suffered any actual damage from the failure of the Indemnitees to give notice as herein provided. The Company will give notice of such matter to the Indemnitees as soon as reasonably practicable. 

Article 13 : CO-OPERATION and investigation 

13.1 The Company shall forthwith conduct such investigation of each proceeding of which it receives written notice pursuant to Article 12 as it deems is reasonably necessary or appropriate in the circumstances and shall pay all costs of such investigation. The Indemnified Party will cooperate fully with the investigation provided that the Indemnified Party shall not be required to provide assistance that would materially prejudice his/her defence or infringe any constitutional or other right he/she may be entitled to assert under law. 

Article 14 : EFFECTive date 

14.1 The right to be indemnified or to the reimbursement or advancement of Expenses pursuant to this Agreement is intended to be retroactive and shall be available with respect to events occurring prior to the execution hereof. For greater certainty, this Agreement shall be effective as and from the first day that the Indemnified Party became or becomes a director or an officer of the Company or an Affiliate or began serving in a capacity similar thereto for the Company or an Affiliate. 

Article 15 : INSOLVENCY 

15.1 It is the intention of the parties hereto that this Agreement and the obligations of the Company will not be affected, discharged, impaired, mitigated or released by reason of any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other similar proceeding of creditors of the Company and that in such event any amount owing to the Indemnitees hereunder will be treated in the same manner as the other fees or expenses of the directors and officers of the Company. 

Article 16 : SURVIVAL 

16.1 Notwithstanding any merger, amalgamation, business combination, reorganization, sale of assets, insolvency proceeding or other corporate change, the obligations of the Company under this Agreement, other than Article 17, shall continue until the later of: 

(a) fifteen (15) years after the Indemnified Party ceases to be a director or an officer of the Company or any Affiliate; and 

(b) one year after the final termination of all proceedings with respect to which the Indemnitees are entitled to claim indemnification under this Agreement. 

16.2 The obligations of the Company under Article 17 of this Agreement shall continue for six (6) years after the Indemnified Party ceases to be a director or an officer of the Company or any Affiliate. 

- 19 - 
 Article 17 : insurance 

17.1 The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and maintain a policy of insurance that has been approved by the Board with respect to liability relating to its directors or officers, which policy shall pursuant to its terms extend to the Indemnified Party in his/her capacity as a director or an officer of the Company. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to include the Indemnified Party as an insured under such policy to the maximum extent reasonably possible and will provide the Indemnified Party with a copy of such policy upon the Indemnified Party being so included as an insured . In the event the Indemnified Party is not named under such policy, the Company shall immediately provide written notice of such fact to the Indemnified Party. Further, the Company shall advise the Indemnified Party promptly after it becomes aware of any material change in, cancellation, termination or lapse in coverage of the aforementioned insurance policy. In the event an insurable event occurs, the Indemnitees will be indemnified promptly as provided in this Agreement regardless of whether the Company has received the insurance proceeds. The Indemnitees are entitled to full indemnification as provided in this Agreement notwithstanding any deductible amounts or policy limits contained in any such insurance policy. 

17.2 In the event the Company is sold or enters into any business combination as a result of which the directors and officers liability insurance policy is terminated and not replaced with a substantially similar policy equally applicable to the Indemnified Party, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause run off tail insurance to be purchased for the benefit of the Indemnified Party with substantially the same coverage for the balance of the six (6) year term set out in Section 16.2. 

Article 18 : TAX ADJUSTMENT 

18.1 Should any payment made pursuant to this Agreement, including the payment of insurance premiums or any payment made by an insurer under an insurance policy, be deemed to constitute a taxable benefit or otherwise be or become subject to any Taxes or levy, then the Company shall pay any amount necessary to ensure that the amount received by or on behalf of the Indemnitees, after the payment of or withholding for Taxes, fully reimburses the Indemnitees for the actual cost, expense or liability incurred by or on behalf of the Indemnitees. 

Article 19 : SUBROGATION 

19.1 To the extent permitted by law, the Company shall be subrogated to all rights which the Indemnitees may have under all policies of insurance or other contracts pursuant to which the Indemnitees may be entitled to reimbursement of, or indemnification in respect of any Expenses borne by the Company pursuant to this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to diminish or otherwise restrict the right of the Company or the Indemnitees to proceed or collect against any insurers or be deemed to give such insurers any rights against the Company under or with respect to this Agreement, including without limitation any right to be subrogated to the Indemnitees rights hereunder, unless otherwise expressly agreed to by the Company in writing, and the obligation of such insurers to the Company and the Indemnified Party shall not be deemed to be reduced or impaired in any respect by virtue of the provisions of this Agreement.
