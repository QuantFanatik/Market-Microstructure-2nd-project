PART I 
 
 Item 1.	Bu siness 
 
 Company Overview 
 
 We are a leading diversified media company with television broadcasting, television network and digital media assets operating in the United States. As of December 31, 2022, we owned, operated, programmed or provided sales and other services to 199 full power television stations and one AM radio station, including television stations owned by VIEs, in 116 markets in 39 states and the District of Columbia. The stations are affiliates of CBS, FOX, NBC, ABC, The CW, and MyNetworkTV MNTV and other broadcast television networks. Our television broadcasts reach approximately 39 of all U.S. television households after applying the Federal Communications Commission s FCC ultra-high-frequency UHF discount and approximately 68 of all U.S. television households excluding the FCC UHF discount. We also own a 75.0 interest in The CW Network, LLC The CW ), one of the major broadcast networks in the U.S., NewsNation, a national cable news network which is distributed to approximately 70 million homes according to The Nielsen Company (US), LLC Nielsen ); two digital multicast networks, Antenna TV and Rewind TV, and a 31.3 ownership stake in Television Food Network, G.P. TV Food Network ). Our digital assets include more than 140 local websites, 280 mobile applications, 22 connected television applications, and six free-ad supported television FAST channels representing content from our local television stations, The CW, NewsNation, The Hill, and BestReviews as well as a suite of advertising solutions for brands and advertisers. Together, our other digital properties attracted almost 100 million unique visitors in December 2022 according to Comscore. 
 
 The stations we own and operate or provide services to provide free programming to consumers in our markets. This programming includes programs produced by third party networks with which the stations are affiliated, programs distributed by our owned and majority-owned broadcast networks to the affiliated stations, content that the stations produce, and syndicated programs that the stations acquire. The CW delivers 14-hours per week of primetime programming and three hours on weekends to its larger market affiliates, 24 hours of programming, seven days per week to its smaller market affiliates via CWPlus and, beginning in 2023, is expanding its programming on the weekends with LIV Golf. The CW also offers its network content as well as a library of other third-party content available for free to users via The CW App. Our NewsNation cable network primarily delivers national news programming supplemented by quality television series and movies. Our digital businesses include video and display advertising platforms that are delivered locally or nationally through our own and various third-party websites, mobile and over-the-top OTT applications, other digital media solutions to media publishers and advertisers and a consumer product reviews platform. 
 
 Our primary sources of revenue include contractual distribution revenue from retransmission consent and carriage agreements with distributors MVPDs ), such as cable and satellite providers, and online video distributors OVDs ), companies that provide video content through internet streaming either directly or via our network affiliation partners as well as affiliation fees from local affiliates of The CW; the sale of commercial air time by the stations to local advertisers; the sale of commercial airtime by the stations and by our cable and broadcast networks to national advertisers; the sale of advertising on the stations websites, on our other owned or third party websites, and through mobile and OTT applications and other digital advertising solutions. 
 
 We also derive significant cash flows from our largest equity investment, a 31.3 interest in TV Food Network. TV Food Network operates two 24-hour television networks, Food Network and Cooking Channel, offering quality television, video, internet and mobile entertainment and information focusing on food and entertaining. 
 
 We seek to grow our revenue, operating income, EBITDA and cash flow by continuing to provide high quality content that attracts and engages audiences as our reach and consumer engagement are important to our distribution partners and advertisers. We use our industry-leading scale to assist us in securing distribution revenue streams, to provide advertisers with solutions across geographies and media types to engage both local and national audiences at scale and to leverage costs against a broader platform. In addition, we plan to continue to acquire or invest in businesses that can benefit from our scale, asset mix and record of management and cost discipline. 
 
 We are a Delaware corporation formed in 1996. Our principal offices are at 545 E. John Carpenter Freeway, Suite 700, Irving, TX 75062. Our telephone number is (972) 373-8800 and our website is http://www.nexstar.tv .

Recent Acquisition 
 On September 30, 2022, we acquired a 75.0 ownership interest in The CW from affiliates of Paramount Global and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (collectively the Sellers for no purchase consideration. Each of the Sellers retained a 12.5 ownership interest and will produce 12 original, scripted series for The CW primarily to air during the 2022/2023 broadcast season. The Sellers have granted us a call right and we granted each of the Sellers a put right for such Seller s ownership interest beginning in August 2024 and June 2026, respectively. The acquisition solidifies our revenue opportunities as the largest owner of The CW-affiliated stations, diversifies our content outside of news, improves our national advertising opportunities, establishes us as a participant in advertising video-on-demand services via The CW App and is expected to create value by improving The CW s ratings, revenue, and profitability. 
 See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the above transaction. 
 Competitive Strengths 
 Unique Combination of Scaled Local Audiences and Powerful National Reach. We believe we are the largest local broadcasting company in the United States, generating 5.2 billion of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our and our partners 200 broadcast stations in 116 local markets reach approximately 68 of U.S. television households (without applying the FCC UHF discount), which local reach is augmented by the national reach we have via our broadcast network, The CW, and our cable news network, NewsNation. According to Nielsen, The CW Network reaches 123.8 million television households, equal to the reach of the ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC broadcast networks and NewsNation reaches 70 million television households virtually equivalent to the reach of CNN and Fox News and greater than the reach of MSNBC. Together, Nexstar can provide both national reach and activation of local audiences at scale, representing a differentiated and attractive value proposition for advertisers and brands in an increasingly fragmented marketplace. 
 Leading Local Franchises. We are focused on building and maintaining leading local franchises in our 116 local markets which are core to our business model. In total, we employ approximately 5,500 local journalists and 1,500 local salespeople, produce almost 300,000 hours of local content, and have developed relationships with over 40,000 local advertisers. Each of the stations that we own, operate, program, or provide sales and other services to creates a highly recognizable local brand, primarily through the quality of local news programming, extensive local sports coverage, and community presence. According to Comscore, in over 76 of our markets in which we produce local newscasts, we rank among the top two stations in local news viewership. We employ a high-quality local sales force in each of our markets to increase revenue from local advertisers by capitalizing on our investment in local programming and community websites. In addition, we own or provide services to more than one station in markets to enable us to broaden our audience share, enhance our revenue share and achieve significant operating efficiencies. In even-numbered years, when most elections are held, we historically have generated substantial revenue from locally driven, political advertising. Given our diverse and expansive geographic reach, we have television stations in more than 80 of markets where there were contested political elections in 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company earned approximately 67.5 of its core and political advertising revenue from non-Network programming. 
 Strong National Brands. We have a portfolio of scaled, strong national brands that enables us to engage with national advertisers in more meaningful ways than we have in the past. Our national brands include The CW Network, NewsNation, The Hill and BestReviews. The CW is America s fifth national broadcast network. NewsNation is America s fastest growing cable news network attracting top on-air talent to its ranks given its mission of delivering fact-based, unbiased journalism. The Hill is the nation s leading, independent political digital media platform. BestReviews is a leading consumer product recommendations company. 
 Diversified Revenue Streams. Our revenue streams are diversified by geography, affiliation and source. In 2022, we generated 49.3 of our revenue from distribution, 33.0 from core advertising (of which approximately 68 was from local sources), 9.7 from political advertising and 8.0 from digital advertising and other sources. No single customer generated more than 12 of our revenue; no single market generated more than 4 of our revenue and our affiliations are diverse with CBS, FOX, NBC, The CW, ABC, and MNTV affiliated stations, representing approximately 25.6 , 22.5 , 20.2 , 12.2 , 11.0 and 3.2 , respectively, of our 2022 combined core and political advertising net revenue. 
 Intense Operational Focus . We emphasize strict controls on operating and programming costs in order to increase EBITDA and free cash flow. We continually seek to identify and implement cost savings at each of our stations, the stations we provide services to and other business units, and our overall size benefits each station or business unit with respect to negotiating favorable terms with programming suppliers and other vendors. By leveraging our size and corporate management expertise, we are able to achieve economies of scale by providing programming, financial, sales and marketing support to our stations, the stations we provide services to and other business units. Our operational execution expertise is the direct result of our talented management team. We seek to attract and retain corporate, business unit and station general managers with proven track records by providing equity incentives.

Attractive Financial Profile. Since 2020, we have grown our revenue each year, generated net cash from operating activities of 1.4 billion in 2022 and in excess of 1.2 billion in each of 2020 and 2021 and returned an increasing amount of that cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends in each year (in total: 382.9 million in 2020, 655.0 million in 2021 and 1.0 billion in 2022) while maintaining a corporate credit rating of Ba3 / BB as rated by Moody s / S P. We believe we have the financial flexibility to both invest in organic and inorganic growth initiatives while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. 
 Growth Strategies 
 We continually seek to generate revenue, operating income, EBITDA and cash flow growth through the following strategies: 
 Leverage Our Scale. We believe we are one of the largest affiliate groups for each of our major broadcast network partners. We are an important partner for the MVPDs and OVDs which include our content in their consumer offerings. Our digital assets attract an audience that makes us a top ten digital news and information property, according to Comscore. Our scale provides us with unique operating advantages in the form of services we can provide to our advertisers, audience and employees, a platform for growth and operating expense synergies and access to capital. As part of this strategy, in January 2023, we announced a newly created advertising sales structure and leadership team designed to drive advertising sales across our diversified media portfolio by further emphasizing our client-first approach, combined with a new data-driven, multi-platform focus. 
 Continue to Grow Distribution and Core and Political Advertising Revenues. We believe our core business of distribution and advertising revenue has the potential to continue to grow for the foreseeable future. We generated 49.3 of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 from distribution fees paid to us by MVPDs and OVDs for retransmission of our content. We believe that the share of audience that our content generates for MVPDs and OVDs is greater than the share of fees those platforms pay us. In 2022, we renegotiated retransmission contracts representing over half of our subscriber base. We generated 33.0 of our revenue from core advertising and 9.7 from political advertising revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. According to SNL Kagan, local broadcast industry advertising revenue should continue to grow over the next ten years. 
 Expand Digital Offerings. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, only 7.0 of our net revenue was generated from digital advertising. We are focused on better monetizing our digital content and audience and growing our portfolio of digital products, services and content and associated revenue streams. In 2022, we launched The Hill TV FAST channel, building upon The Hill s success as an essential, agenda-setting read for lawmakers, policymakers and influential digital consumers. In 2021, we launched STELLAR, our unified digital platform that enables advertisers to increase customer acquisition and deliver effective omni-channel advertising campaigns. 
 Operate and Expand National Broadcast and Cable Networks . We seek to continue to increase the viewership and revenues of our national television network assets, The CW and NewsNation. 
 
 The CW. We acquired The CW in September 2022 for no consideration. As the largest affiliate of The CW, we acquired the network to sustain and grow our CW-related revenue streams and to improve this underexploited national broadcast network asset. Our growth strategy for The CW is three-fold: First, we intend to improve and diversify the programming to align with audiences with the intention of improving ratings and revenue. To that end, in January 2023, we announced that The CW entered into an exclusive broadcast partnership with LIV Golf; Second, we are focused on accelerating digital growth via The CW App and cwtv.com by monetizing The CW Network s content and a library of third-party content; and Third, we are actively reducing costs while focusing on execution. We believe there is potential for The CW to improve its profitability in line with other broadcast networks but also improve the profitability of Nexstar s CW affiliates. 
 
 NewsNation . In 2020, we initiated the conversion of WGN America to NewsNation, a new cable news network, leveraging our core competency in news and profitable foundation to build a network focused on providing unbiased, fact-based news. Since then, NewsNation has emerged as America s fastest growing cable news network and has been recognized by independent watchdog groups such as Ad Fontes Media, NewsGuard and AllSides, for its independent, unbiased reporting of national and local news. Currently, NewsNation provides 17 hours of news content each weekday which we expect to grow to 24 hours by the end of 2023 and to 24 hours, seven-days-a-week by 2024. We believe there is significant growth potential for NewsNation as news networks are among the most watched and profitable cable networks. 
 Develop New Revenue Streams. We seek to generate new revenue streams leveraging the platform and assets of our company. Given our extensive station portfolio and geographic coverage, we are in the process of converting the technology used by our stations to a new standard, ATSC 3.0, which will enable us to provide new high speed data transmission services to businesses and consumers. Our goal is to increase our total ATSC 3.0 coverage of U.S. television households to approximately 50 from 35 as of December 31, 2022. We anticipate that this conversion will enable us to develop a new business and generate additional revenue in the future. 
 
 6 

Acquire and Invest in New and Complementary Businesses. We selectively pursue acquisitions where we believe we can improve revenue, operating income, EBITDA and cash flow through active management. We selectively pursue acquisitions of businesses that leverage our platform, scale and capabilities and are complementary to our vision of providing local news, entertainment, and sports content through broadcast and digital platforms. In addition, we will continue to pursue television station acquisitions in markets where permitted by the current regulatory framework. 
 
 Relationship with VIEs 
 Through various local service agreements, as of December 31, 2022, we provided sales, programming and other services to 35 full power television stations owned by consolidated VIEs and one full power television station owned by an unconsolidated VIE. As of December 31, 2022, all of the VIEs and their stations are 100 owned by independent third parties. In compliance with FCC regulations for all the parties, the VIEs maintain complete responsibility for and control over programming, finances, personnel and operations of their stations. However, for the consolidated VIEs, we are deemed under U.S. GAAP to have controlling financial interests in these entities because of (i) the local service agreements Nexstar has with the consolidated VIEs stations, (ii) Nexstar s (excluding The CW) guarantee of the obligations incurred under the senior secured credit facility of Mission Broadcasting, Inc. Mission ), a consolidated VIE, (iii) Nexstar having power over significant activities affecting the consolidated VIEs economic performance, including budgeting for advertising revenue, certain advertising sales and, in some cases, hiring and firing of sales force personnel and (iv) purchase options granted by each consolidated VIE which permit Nexstar to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of all of the consolidated VIEs stations at any time, subject to FCC consent. These purchase options are freely exercisable or assignable by Nexstar without consent or approval by the VIEs. These option agreements expire on various dates between 2023 and 2033. We expect to renew these option agreements upon expiration. Therefore, these VIEs are consolidated into these financial statements. 
 For additional information on VIEs, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Industry Background 
 Commercial television broadcasting began in the United States on a regular basis in the 1940s. A limited number of channels are available for over-the-air broadcasting in any one geographic area and a license to operate a television station must be granted by the FCC. All television stations in the country are grouped by Nielsen, a national audience measuring service, into 210 generally recognized television markets, known as DMAs, that are ranked in size according to various metrics based upon actual or potential audience. Each DMA is an exclusive geographic area consisting of all counties in which the home-market commercial stations receive the greatest percentage of total viewing hours. Nielsen publishes data on estimated audiences for the television stations in each DMA on a quarterly basis. The estimates are expressed in terms of a rating, which is a station s percentage of the total potential audience in the market, or a share, which is the station s percentage of the audience actually watching television. A station s rating in the market can be a factor in determining advertising rates. 
 Most television stations are affiliated with networks and receive a significant part of their programming, including prime-time hours, from networks. Whether or not a station is affiliated with one of the four major networks (CBS, FOX, NBC or ABC) has a significant impact on the composition of the station s revenue, expenses and operations. Network programming is provided to the affiliate by the network in exchange for the payment to the network of affiliation fees and the network s retention of a substantial majority of the advertising time during network programs. The network then sells this advertising time and retains the revenue. The affiliate retains the revenue from the remaining advertising time it sells during network programs and from advertising time it sells during non-network programs. 
 Broadcast television stations compete for advertising revenue primarily with other commercial broadcast television stations, MVPDs, OVDs, Alphabet Inc., Meta, TikTok, Snapchat and other online media, and newspapers and radio stations serving the same market. Non-commercial, religious and Spanish-language broadcasting stations in many markets also compete with commercial stations for viewers. In addition, the internet and other leisure activities may draw viewers away from commercial television stations. 
 Distribution 
 We receive compensation from cable, satellite and other MVPDs and OVDs in return for our consent to the retransmission of the signals of our television stations and the carriage of NewsNation. Distribution revenues primarily represent payments from the MVPDs and OVDs and are typically based on the number of subscribers they have. Our successful negotiations with these distributors have created agreements that produce meaningful recurring revenue streams. 
 Advertising 
 General 
 Our core television advertising revenue is derived from the sale of local and national advertising. For our stations, we sell, and retain all of the revenue from the sale of advertising time in our locally produced content and the portion of advertising time in network or syndicated content that is allocated to the station and not already sold by the network or syndicator. For our national broadcast and cable networks, we sell national advertising in the portion of advertising time we retain. 
 Advertisers wishing to reach a national audience usually purchase time directly from the networks or advertise nationwide on a case-by-case basis. National advertisers who wish to reach a particular region or local audience often buy advertising time directly from local stations through national advertising sales representative firms. Local businesses purchase advertising time directly from the station s local sales staff. 
 Advertising rates are based upon a number of factors, including: 
 audience size and demographics of a station, network or program that an advertiser wishes to target; 

the number of advertisers competing for the available time; 

the availability of alternative advertising media; 

the effectiveness of the salesforce; 

development of projects, features and programs that tie advertiser messages to programming; and 

the level of spending commitment made by the advertiser. 

Advertising revenue is positively affected by a strong economy. Conversely, declines in advertising budgets of advertisers, particularly in recessionary periods, adversely affect the broadcast industry and, as a result, may contribute to a decrease in the revenue of broadcast television stations. 
 
 12 

In even-numbered years we generate substantial advertising revenue from the political advertising we sell to candidates, political action committees and political parties primarily through national advertising sales representation firms. Every four years, our political advertising revenues are positively affected by additional advertising related to the presidential election. The sale of political advertising is regulated by the FCC which establishes guidelines governing candidate and non-candidate rules regarding rate, content and amount of time that is sold. 
 Seasonality 
 Advertising revenue is positively affected by national and regional political election campaigns and certain events such as the Olympic Games or the Super Bowl. Advertising revenue is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to, and including, the holiday season. In addition, advertising revenue is generally higher during even-numbered years, when congressional and/or presidential elections occur and from advertising aired during the Olympic Games. 
 Advertising Sales 
 Local advertising time is sold by each station s local sales staff who call upon advertising agencies and local businesses, which typically include car dealerships, retail stores and restaurants. Compared to revenue from national advertising accounts, revenue from local advertising is generally more stable and more predictable. We seek to attract new advertisers to the television stations and their associated websites and to increase the amount of advertising time sold to existing local advertisers by relying on experienced local sales forces with strong community ties, producing news and other programming with local advertising appeal and sponsoring or co-promoting local events and activities. We place a strong emphasis on the experience of our local sales staffs and maintain an on-going training program for sales personnel. 
 National and political advertising time is sold through national sales representative firms which call upon advertising agencies, whose clients typically include automobile manufacturers and dealer groups, telecommunications companies, fast food franchisers and national retailers (some of which may also advertise locally). 
 Network Affiliations 
 All of the full power television stations that we own and operate, program or provide sales and other services to are currently affiliated with a network pursuant to an affiliation agreement, except for WGN-TV, WDVM and KAUT. The agreements with CBS, FOX, NBC, ABC, and The CW are the most significant to our operations. The current terms of these agreements expire as discussed below:

In exchange, the network receives affiliation fees from us and has the right to sell a substantial majority of the advertising time during these broadcasts. We expect the network affiliation agreements listed above to be renewed upon expiration.

Investments 
 We derive significant cash flows from our largest equity method investment, a 31.3 interest in TV Food Network, which operates two 24-hour television networks, Food Network and Cooking Channel, offering quality television, video, internet and mobile entertainment and information focusing on food and entertaining. During 2022, we received cash distributions from TV Food Network totaling 249.4 million. Our partner in TV Food Network is Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc., which owns a 68.7 interest in TV Food Network and operates the networks on behalf of the partnership. 
 
 Competition 
 Competition in the television industry takes place on several levels: competition for audience, competition for programming and competition for advertising. 
 Audience . We compete for audience based on program popularity. The popularity of our programming has a direct effect on the advertising rates we can charge our advertisers. We compete against other broadcast television programming, cable and satellite television programming as well as the plethora of direct-to-consumer programming provided via a variety of streaming services, including some of the broadcast television networks with which our stations are affiliated. Other sources of competition for audience include the internet, gaming devices, home entertainment systems, video-on-demand and pay-per-view. 
 Specifically, The CW, our broadcast television network, competes with other broadcast networks and other distribution technologies for viewers and NewsNation, our growing national cable news network, competes with other established national news networks such as CNN, FOX News and MSNBC for viewers. 
 Programming . Our local television stations compete for syndicated programming from national program distributors or syndicators as well as compete to secure broadcast rights for regional and local sporting events. We compete against in-market broadcast station operators, cable networks and streaming services for exclusive access to this programming in our markets. In a different way, our local stations also compete with other stations in their markets to provide exclusive news stories and unique features such as investigative reporting and coverage of community events to their local audience. The CW competes against other broadcast television and cable networks as well as other video providers, such as direct-to-consumer streaming platforms for television content. NewsNation competes against other cable news networks for talent and stories. 
 Advertising . Our stations compete for advertising revenue with other television stations in their respective markets and other advertising media such as online media (e.g., Alphabet Inc., Meta, etc.), OVDs, MVPDs, radio stations, newspapers, outdoor advertising, and direct mail, among others. Competition for advertising dollars in the broadcasting industry occurs primarily within individual markets. Generally, a television broadcast station in a particular market does not compete with stations in other market areas. The CW also competes for advertising revenue with other broadcast networks and other distribution technologies. NewsNation also competes for advertising revenue with other advertising media and with other established national networks such as CNN, FOX News and MSNBC. 
 
 The broadcasting industry is continually faced with technological change and innovation which increase the popularity of competing entertainment and communications media. Further advances in technology may increase competition for household audiences and advertisers. An increase in the popularity of OVDs may result in popular product offerings that do not include television broadcast stations or result in moving popular network programming to air concurrently or exclusively via OVDs. The increased use of digital technology by MVPDs, along with video compression techniques, will reduce the bandwidth required for television signal transmission. These technological developments are applicable to all video delivery systems, including over-the-air broadcasting, and have the potential to provide vastly expanded programming to highly targeted audiences. Reductions in the cost of creating additional channel capacity could lower entry barriers for new channels. We are unable to predict the effect that these or other technological changes will have on the broadcast television industry or on the future results of our operations or the operations of the stations to which we provide services.

Federal Regulation 
 Television broadcasting is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act ). The following is a brief discussion of certain (but not all) provisions of the Communications Act and the FCC s regulations and policies that affect the business operations of television broadcast stations. Over the years, the U.S. Congress and the FCC have added, amended and deleted statutory and regulatory requirements to which station owners are subject. Some of these changes have a minimal business impact whereas others may significantly affect the business or operation of individual stations or the broadcast industry as a whole. For more information about the nature and extent of FCC regulation of television broadcast stations, refer to the Communications Act and the FCC s rules, case precedent, public notices and policies. 
 License Grant and Renewal. The Communications Act prohibits the operation of broadcast stations except under licenses issued by the FCC. Television broadcast licenses are granted for a maximum term of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application to the FCC. The FCC is required to grant an application for license renewal if during the preceding term the station served the public interest, the licensee did not commit any serious violations of the Communications Act or the FCC s rules, and the licensee committed no other violations of the Communications Act or the FCC s rules which, taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse. A majority of renewal applications are routinely granted under this standard. If a licensee fails to meet this standard the FCC may still grant renewal on terms and conditions that it deems appropriate, including a monetary forfeiture or renewal for a term less than the normal eight-year period. 
 After a renewal application is filed, interested parties, including members of the public, may file petitions to deny the application, to which the licensee/renewal applicant is entitled to respond. After reviewing the pleadings, if the FCC determines that there is a substantial and material question of fact whether grant of the renewal application would serve the public interest, the FCC is required to hold a hearing on the issues presented. If, after the hearing, the FCC determines that the renewal applicant has met the renewal standard, the FCC will grant the renewal application. If the licensee/renewal applicant fails to meet the renewal standard or show that there are mitigating factors entitling it to renewal subject to appropriate sanctions, the FCC can deny the renewal application. In the vast majority of cases where a petition to deny is filed against a renewal application, the FCC ultimately grants the renewal without a hearing. No competing application for authority to operate a station and replace the incumbent licensee may be filed against a renewal application. 
 In addition to considering rule violations in connection with a license renewal application, the FCC may sanction a station licensee for failing to observe FCC rules and policies during the license term, including the imposition of a monetary forfeiture. 
 Under the Communications Act, the term of a broadcast license is automatically extended during the pendency of the FCC s processing of a timely renewal application. We began filing license renewal applications for our stations in June 2020 and will continue these filings through April 2023. 
 Station Transfer . The Communications Act prohibits the assignment or the transfer of control of a broadcast license without prior FCC approval. 
 Foreign Ownership Restrictions . The Communications Act limits the extent of non-U.S. ownership of companies that own U.S. broadcast stations. Under this restriction, the holder of a U.S. broadcast license may have no more than 20 non-U.S. ownership (by vote and by equity). The Communications Act further prohibits more than 25 indirect foreign ownership or control of a licensee through a parent company if the FCC determines the public interest will be served by enforcement of such restriction. The FCC has interpreted this provision of the Communications Act to require an affirmative public interest finding before indirect foreign ownership of a broadcast licensee may exceed 25 . The FCC will entertain and may authorize, on a case-by-case basis and upon a sufficient public interest showing and favorable executive branch review, proposals to exceed the 25 indirect foreign ownership limit in broadcast licensees. 
 
 Multiple Ownership Restrictions . The FCC also has rules which establish limits on the ownership of television broadcast stations in local markets and nationally. These ownership limits apply to attributable interests in a station licensee held by an individual, corporation, partnership or other entity. In the case of corporations, officers, directors and voting stock interests of 5 or more (20 or more in the case of certain passive investors, such as insurance companies and bank trust departments) are considered attributable interests. For partnerships, all general partners and non-insulated limited partners are attributable. Limited liability companies are treated the same as partnerships. The FCC also considers attributable the holder of more than 33 of a licensee s total assets (defined as total debt plus total equity), if that person or entity also provides over 15 of the station s total weekly broadcast programming or has an attributable interest in another media entity in the same market which is subject to the FCC s ownership rules. If a shareholder of Nexstar holds a voting stock interest of 5 or more (20 or more in the case of certain passive investors, such as insurance companies and bank trust departments), we must report that shareholder, its parent entities, and attributable individuals and entities of both, as attributable interest holders in Nexstar. 
 
 15 

The FCC multiple ownership rules currently applicable to television broadcasters are summarized below: 
 
 Local Television Ownership (Duopoly) Rule . Under the current local television ownership, or duopoly, rule, a single entity is allowed to own or have attributable interests in two television stations in a DMA if (i) the two stations do not have overlapping service areas, or (ii) at least one of the two stations is not ranked among the top four stations in the DMA in terms of audience share (although the FCC may determine, on a case-by-case basis upon a sufficient showing, that the public interest would not be served by enforcing this top four prohibition). The duopoly rule also allows the FCC to consider waivers to permit the ownership of a second station, where otherwise prohibited, where the second station has failed or is failing or unbuilt. 
 
 In certain markets, the Company owns and operates both full-power and low-power television broadcast stations. The FCC s rules and policies regarding ownership of television stations in the same market and nationally apply only to full-power television stations and not low-power television stations. 
 
 In a number of markets, the Company owns two stations in compliance with the duopoly rule. We also are permitted to own two or more stations in various other markets pursuant to an exemption under the FCC s rules permitting common ownership of a satellite television station in a market where a licensee also owns the primary station. Additionally, we are permitted to own two stations in the Quad Cities, Illinois/Iowa, Greenville-Spartanburg, South Carolina-Asheville, North Carolina and Hartford-New Haven, Connecticut markets pursuant to waivers allowing ownership of a second station where that station is failing. We also own two top four stations in the Indianapolis, Indiana market pursuant to an FCC determination that prohibition of such ownership would not serve the public interest. 
 
 National Television Ownership Limit. The FCC s rules limit the percentage of U.S. television households which a party may reach through its attributable interests in television stations to 39 . When calculating a party s nationwide aggregate audience coverage, the ownership of a UHF station is counted as 50 of a market s percentage of total national audience. In December 2017, the FCC initiated a proceeding to broadly reexamine its national television ownership rule, including the percentage reach cap and the so-called UHF discount. Comments and reply comments in this proceeding were filed in 2018, and the proceeding remains open. 
 
 The stations that Nexstar owns have a combined national audience reach of approximately 39 of all U.S. television households (applying the FCC s UHF discount). 
 
 Attribution of Local Service Agreements . The FCC attributes the local television ownership limits toward another in-market station when one station owner programs that station pursuant to a TBA or LMA, if the programmer provides more than 15 of the second station s weekly broadcast programming. However, LMAs entered into prior to November 5, 1996 are exempt attributable interests until the FCC determines otherwise. This grandfathering, when reviewed by the FCC, is subject to possible extension or termination. We provide more than 15 of a non-owned station s programming under a TBA or LMA in six markets. In five of these markets WFXP in Erie, Pennsylvania, KHMT in Billings, Montana, KFQX in Grand Junction, Colorado, KNVA in Austin, Texas and WNAC-TV in Providence, Rhode Island the TBAs or LMAs were entered into prior to November 5, 1996 and are considered grandfathered. Therefore, we may continue to program these stations under the terms of these agreements until the FCC determines otherwise. Our LMA with Mission for WPIX in New York is not attributable because we do not own a station in that market and do not have any equity or debt interests in Mission. 
 
 Under current FCC rules, our JSAs and SSAs with independently owned same-market stations are non-attributable. We may therefore retain our existing JSAs and SSAs in effect and enter into new ones, but we must publicly disclose them, and the FCC may in the future consider regulations with respect to such agreements. 
 
 Quadrennial Review of Media Ownership Rules . The FCC is required to review its media ownership rules every four years and to eliminate those rules it finds are no longer necessary in the public interest as a result of competition. The FCC s two most recent quadrennial reviews those for 2010 and 2014 were eventually consolidated into a single proceeding that involved extensive litigation, an agency reconsideration and multiple court appeals, culminating in an April 1, 2021 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court which upheld the FCC s elimination or relaxation of several rules. The 2018 quadrennial review, which the FCC commenced in December 2018, remains pending, and the FCC has solicited and received comments to update the record of that proceeding in the wake of the Supreme Court s decision. Additionally, notwithstanding the pendency of the 2018 review, in December 2022 the FCC opened its 2022 quadrennial review proceeding. Thus, the media ownership rules are subject to change as a result of current and future quadrennial reviews and in other proceedings. 
 
 16 

MVPD Carriage of Local Television Signals . Broadcasters may obtain carriage of their stations signals on cable, satellite and other MVPDs through either mandatory carriage or through retransmission consent. Every three years all stations must formally elect either mandatory carriage must-carry for cable distributors and carry one-carry all for satellite television providers) or retransmission consent. The next election must be made by October 1, 2023 and will be effective January 1, 2024. Must-carry elections require that the MVPD carry one station programming stream and related data in the station s local market. However, MVPDs may decline a must-carry election in certain circumstances. MVPDs do not pay a fee to stations that elect mandatory carriage. 
 
 A broadcaster that elects retransmission consent waives its mandatory carriage rights, and the broadcaster and the MVPD must negotiate for carriage of the station s signal. Negotiated terms may include channel position, service tier carriage, carriage of multiple program streams, compensation and other consideration. If a broadcaster elects to negotiate retransmission terms, it is possible that the broadcaster and the MVPD will not reach agreement and that the MVPD will not carry the station s signal. 
 
 FCC rules and federal statutory law require retransmission consent negotiations to be conducted in good faith. It is a violation of the duty to negotiate in good faith for a television broadcast station to negotiate retransmission consent jointly with another station in the same market if the stations are not commonly owned. Under this rule, stations may not (i) delegate authority to negotiate or approve a retransmission consent agreement to another non-commonly owned station located in the same DMA or to a third-party that negotiates on behalf of another non-commonly owned station in the same DMA; or (ii) if located in the same DMA and not commonly owned, facilitate or agree to facilitate coordinated negotiation of retransmission consent terms between themselves, including through the sharing of information. Accordingly, the VIEs with which we have sharing agreements must separately negotiate their retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs for stations in markets where we also own a station. 
 
 MVPD operators have actively sought to change the regulations under which retransmission consent is negotiated before both the U.S. Congress and the FCC in order to increase their bargaining leverage with television stations. There are still-open FCC proceedings to review the totality of the circumstances test for good faith retransmission consent negotiations, and to eliminate or modify the FCC s non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules (which could permit MVPDs to import out-of-market television stations in certain circumstances). 
 
 The FCC s rules also govern which local television signals a satellite subscriber may receive. The U.S. Congress and the FCC have also imposed certain requirements relating to satellite distribution of local television signals to unserved households that do not receive a useable signal from a local network-affiliated station and to cable and satellite carriage of out-of-market signals. 
 
 Certain OVDs have successfully or unsuccessfully sought to stream broadcast programming over the internet. In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court held that an OVD s retransmissions of broadcast television signals without the consent of the broadcast station violate federal copyright law. In December 2014, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to interpret the term MVPD to encompass OVDs that make available for purchase multiple streams of video programming distributed at a prescheduled time and seeking comment on the effects of applying MVPD rules to such OVDs. The proceeding remains open. Although the FCC has not classified OVDs as MVPDs to date, a number of OVDs have signed agreements for retransmission of local stations within their markets, and others are actively seeking to negotiate such agreements. 
 
 The Company has elected to exercise retransmission consent rights for all of its stations where it has legal rights to do so. The Company has negotiated retransmission consent agreements with the majority of MVPDs serving its markets to carry the stations signals and, where permitted by its network affiliation agreements, will negotiate agreements with OVDs.

Human Capital Management 
 Values . Our key human capital management objectives are to attract, develop, and retain top industry talent that reflects the diversity of the communities in which we operate and provide services. We encourage every individual s contribution and personal growth and foster work environments that provide personal pride through job satisfaction and a balanced life. We embrace the communities in which we operate and promote open communications, innovation and creativity. 
 Engagement and Opportunities . With markets ranging from small to large to national, we offer a broad range of opportunities for every experience level, including for those who are just starting their broadcasting career or are ready to make the leap into a larger market or onto the national stage. Our market diversity allows us to give our employees room to grow and progress in their careers. Our management team supports a culture of developing future leaders from our existing workforce, enabling us to promote from within for many leadership positions. As of December 31, 2022, our voluntary retention rate for employees was approximately 78 . We offer our employees a broad range of company-paid benefits and we believe our compensation package and benefits are competitive with others in our industry. Our employee wages are competitive and consistent with employee positions, experience, knowledge and location. In addition, in 2019, the Company initiated a company-wide minimum wage above the federal requirement, which increased effective January 1, 2021 and January 1, 2022. Annual wage increases and incentive payments are based on merit and are communicated to employees as a part of the annual review process. In January 2022, we also enhanced our parental leave and short-term disability programs, including the granting of up to six weeks of paid leave for eligible employees regardless of gender, offering birth mothers to take paid parental leave in addition to using short-term disability benefits and increasing the maximum weekly short-term disability benefit paid to employees by 100 . 
 Community Outreach . At Nexstar, we pride ourselves on the opportunities we provide for our employees to give back to their communities. Since our 20th anniversary in June 2016 (with the exception of 2020), we have organized an annual Founder s Day of Caring, an employee driven effort focused on local non-profits and charities. Across the country our employees take the day to contribute thousands of hours of community services. In 2022, our Founder s Day initiatives provided nearly 17,000 hours of service in one day to the communities served by Nexstar TV stations. 
 Diversity and Inclusion . We strive to foster a culture of diversity and inclusion so all of our employees feel respected and none of them feels discriminated against. In 2020, we launched our Diversity and Inclusion Council, a working committee dedicated to creating a path toward a more diverse and inclusive workplace, where diverse talent can flourish and build a career. The Council is comprised of ten members from throughout the Company, with membership changing periodically. In 2020, the Council initiated our Employee Resource Groups and established a model mentorship program that were rolled out Company-wide. We value diversity at all levels and continue to focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce. We believe a diverse workforce fosters innovation and cultivates an environment of unique perspectives. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 41 and 28 of our employees and our management (Vice Presidents and above), respectively, were women. In the U.S., approximately 26 and 12 of our employees and our management, respectively, were racially/ethnically diverse. This compares to approximately 40 of the U.S. population which is racially/ethnically diverse (source: 2020 United States Census Bureau population). In order to ensure accountability in making progress in our diversity goals, a portion of our managers bonuses are tied to diversity metrics in their markets. In addition, we have implemented Employee Resource Groups in the categories of Latinx, Women, African American, Veterans and LGBTQ+. These groups are designed to bring together employees who share similar cultures, backgrounds, and/or interests, as well as those employees who wish to provide support to that group. 
 Training and Mentorship . We are committed to developing the talents of our employees and provide our employees online workplace training. Our catalog of courses includes harassment prevention, diversity/equity/inclusion, ethics, managing bias, supervisor/manager skills, and COVID-19 safety. In addition, we have a mentorship program that matches mentors and mentees across the company and provides the pairs with a 12-topic curriculum covering skills such as communications, networking, work/life balance, and goal setting. 
 In 2018, Nexstar settled a U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division investigation, as did a number of other television broadcasting companies. Nexstar did not admit any wrongdoing but, as a part of the settlement agreement, it agreed to take certain actions, including providing training programs to all officers and sales related employees, to ensure they understand the antitrust laws, how those laws apply to Nexstar and our employees and to help them spot common patterns that may implicate antitrust laws. 
 Nexstar sales employees also participate in a media sales training program provided by The Center for Sales Strategy, a third-party vendor.

Safety and Health . We value our employees and are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace. All employees are required to comply with our safety rules and are expected to actively contribute to making our company a safer place to work. We have taken, and continue to take, robust actions to help protect the health, safety and well-being of our employees, to support our suppliers and local communities, and to continue to serve our customers. Employees must immediately report accidents, injuries, and unsafe equipment, practices or conditions to a supervisor or other designated person. The Company is committed to keep its workplaces free from hazards. Threats or acts of violence or physical intimidation are also prohibited, and will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. 
 Employees. As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 12,971 employees, comprised of 11,666 full-time and 1,305 part-time employees. As of December 31, 2022, 1,829 of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our employee relations are satisfactory, and we have not experienced any work stoppages at any of our facilities. However, we cannot assure you that our collective bargaining agreements will be renewed in the future, or that we will not experience a prolonged labor dispute, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we are involved in litigation that arises from the ordinary operations of business, such as contractual or employment disputes or other general actions. In the event of an adverse outcome of these proceedings, we believe the resulting liabilities would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 1A.	Risk Factors 
 You should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the information contained in this document. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company s business operations. If any of those risks occur, the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and the Company s actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for further information. 
 
 Summary Risk Factors 
 
 Our business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives or may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects. These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to: 
 
 Risks Related to Our Operations 
 
 Our operating results are dependent on distribution revenue, which may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including non-renewal or renewal at less favorable terms of our retransmission consent agreements, changes in retransmission consent regulations and drop in subscriptions to cable and satellite providers; 

Demand for television advertising may be adversely affected as consumers migrate to alternative media for entertainment; 

The revenue generated by our stations could decline substantially if they fail to maintain or renew their network agreements on favorable terms, or at all; 

A significant concentration of our revenue is from a select number of customers; 

Our substantial debt could limit our ability to grow and compete; 

Our growth may be limited if we are unable to implement our organic growth initiatives and/or acquisition strategy; 

Changes in FCC rules may restrict our ability to own or provide services to multiple stations in local markets; 

The FCC s and DOJ s local and national media ownership rules limit our ability to acquire television stations in particular markets or new markets; 

The FCC may deny renewal of the FCC license of any of our stations, requiring that station to cease operation; 

The owners of the VIEs may make decisions regarding the operation of their respective stations that could reduce the amount of cash we receive under our local service agreements; 

Future impairment charges on our goodwill, intangible assets and equity investments could adversely affect our future results from operations; 

The recording of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in the future or the impact of tax law changes on such deferred tax assets could affect our operating results; 

We may face additional tax liabilities stemming from proposed and ongoing tax audits; 

Our pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations may be increased by a declining stock market and lower interest rates; 

Adverse results from litigation or governmental investigations involving us can impact our business practices and operating results; 

20 

Any decrease in our dividend payments or suspension in our dividend payments or stock repurchases could cause our stock price to decline; 

We may not be able to adequately protect the intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business; 

Cybersecurity risks could affect our operating effectiveness; and 

The continuing effects of COVID-19 may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

Risks Related to Our Industry 
 
 Our operating results are dependent on advertising revenue, making us potentially more vulnerable to economic downturns and other factors beyond our control; 

Due to our high fixed operating expenses, a relatively small decrease in revenue could have a significant negative impact on our operating income; 

Our television business may not be able to compete effectively if we are unable to respond to changes in technology and evolving advertising trends; 

Intense competition in the television industry and alternative forms of media could limit our growth and profitability; 

New legislation and regulation could significantly impact the operations of our stations or the television broadcasting industry as a whole; and 

The FCC s reallocation of a portion of the spectrum available for use by television broadcasters to wireless broadband could substantially impact our future operations. 

Risks Related to Tribune Media Company Tribune s Emergence from Bankruptcy 
 
 We may incur unforeseen costs in connection with Tribune s Chapter 11 proceedings. 

Risks Related to Tribune Publishing s Spin-Off 
 
 Tribune may be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes if the Tribune Publishing spin-off does not qualify as a tax-free distribution under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code; 

Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws and Delaware corporate law may permit a court to void the Tribune Publishing spin-off; and 

We may be exposed to additional liabilities as a result of the Tribune Publishing spin-off. 

21 

Risks Related to Our Operations 
 
 Our distribution revenues, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by non-renewals or renewals at less favorable terms of retransmission consent agreements, further change in the current retransmission consent regulations, or if the rate of declines in the number of subscribers of MVPDs increases. 
 
 A significant portion of Nexstar s revenue comes from its retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs (mainly cable and satellite television providers) and OVDs. These agreements permit the distributors to retransmit our stations and our cable and broadcast networks signals to their subscribers in exchange for the payment of compensation to us. If we are unable to renegotiate these agreements on favorable terms, or at all, the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Though we are typically able to renegotiate our retransmission consent agreements on favorable terms, the payments due us under these agreements are customarily based on a price per subscriber of the applicable distributor. In the past several years, the number of subscribers to MVPDs has declined as the growth of direct internet streaming of video programming to televisions and mobile devices has led consumers to discontinue their cable or satellite service subscriptions. As our retransmission consent agreements include payment terms by subscriber numbers, if the rate of reductions in the number of MVPD subscribers increases, this could also have an adverse effect on our business revenues, financial condition and results of operations. Also, refer to Risks Related to Our Industry Intense competition in the television industry and alternative forms of media could limit our growth and profitability. 
 
 Moreover, the national television broadcast networks have taken the position that they, as the owners or licensees of certain of the programming we broadcast and provide for retransmission, are entitled to a portion of the compensation we receive from MVPDs under our retransmission consent agreements and are requiring their network affiliation agreements with us to provide for such payments. All of our affiliation agreements with the broadcast networks also include terms that limit our ability to grant retransmission consent rights to traditional MVPDs as well as OVDs, services that provide video streaming to consumers. As a result, the networks negotiate directly with OVDs for carriage of their local affiliate stations, including certain of our stations. The terms the networks negotiate may be unfavorable or unacceptable to us, as a result of which we may receive reduced revenue from our stations carriage on OVDs or may choose not to permit an OVD s carriage of our stations at all. The need to pay a portion of our retransmission consent revenue to our networks, and network limitations on our ability to enter into retransmission consent agreements or realize sufficient revenue from such agreements, could materially reduce this revenue source to the Company and could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 In addition, federal statutes and regulations govern our retransmission consent negotiations with MVPDs. Under federal law, for example, we must negotiate retransmission consent in good faith, and we are prohibited from negotiating jointly with non-commonly owned television stations (including our VIEs) in markets where we own a station. These statutes and regulations are subject to change, and in recent years MVPDs have actively sought to change the regulations under which retransmission consent is negotiated before both the U.S. Congress and the FCC in order to increase their bargaining leverage with television stations. For example, pursuant to federal legislation, the FCC has adopted rules that require large [television] groups (which include Nexstar) to negotiate retransmission consent in good faith with certain qualified [MVPD] buying group[s] comprised of multiple MVPDs. Nexstar s obligation to negotiate retransmission consent on a collective basis with certain groups of MVPDs may add complexity to Nexstar s overall negotiation process and could adversely affect the amount and flow of Nexstar s retransmission consent revenues. Moreover, there are still-open FCC proceedings to review the totality of the circumstances test for good faith retransmission consent negotiations, to eliminate or modify the FCC s non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules (which could permit MVPDs to import out-of-market television stations in certain circumstances), and to apply MVPD rules to certain OVDs. These and other changes to the retransmission consent regulatory scheme, if adopted, could materially and adversely impact our retransmission revenues and thus our business. 

22 

General trends in the television industry could adversely affect demand for television advertising as consumers migrate to alternative media, including the internet, for entertainment. 
 
 Television viewing among consumers has been negatively impacted by the increasing availability of alternative media, including the internet. In recent years, demand for television advertising has been declining and demand for advertising in alternative media has been increasing, and we expect this trend to continue. 
 
 The networks are streaming the majority of their programming on the internet and other distribution platforms simultaneously with, or in close proximity to, network programming broadcast on local television stations, including those we own or provide services to. These and other practices by the networks dilute the exclusivity and value of network programming historically broadcast by the affiliated local stations and may adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of our stations. Also, refer to Risks Related to Our Industry Intense competition in the television industry and alternative forms of media could limit our growth and profitability. 
 
 The revenue generated by stations we operate or provide services to could decline substantially if they fail to maintain or renew their network affiliation agreements on favorable terms, or at all. 
 
 Due to the quality of the programming provided by the networks, stations that are affiliated with a network generally have higher ratings than unaffiliated independent stations in the same market. As a result, it is important for stations to maintain their network affiliations. Most of the stations that we operate or provide services to have network affiliation agreements. Currently, 29 full power television stations have primary affiliation agreements with ABC, 35 with NBC, 42 with FOX, 49 with CBS, 23 with The CW and 18 with MNTV. Each of ABC, NBC and CBS generally provides affiliated stations with up to 22 hours of prime-time programming per week, while each of FOX, MNTV and The CW provides affiliated stations with up to 15 hours of prime-time programming per week. In return, affiliated stations broadcast the applicable network s commercials during the network programming. 
 
 All of the network affiliation agreements of the stations that we own, operate, program or provide sales and other services to are scheduled to expire at various times through December 2026. In order to renew certain of our affiliation agreements we may be required to make cash payments to the network and to accept other material modifications of existing affiliation agreements. If any of our stations cease to maintain affiliation agreements with their networks for any reason, we would need to find alternative sources of programming, which may be less attractive to our audiences and more expensive to obtain. In addition, a loss of a specific network affiliation for a station may affect our retransmission consent payments, resulting in us receiving less retransmission consent fees. Further, some of our network affiliation agreements are subject to earlier termination by the networks under specified circumstances. 
 
 For more information regarding these network affiliation agreements, see Item 1, Business Network Affiliations. 
 
 A significant concentration of our revenue is from a select number of customers. 
 
 During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company s revenues from two customers exceeded 10 . Each of these customers represents approximately 10 and 11 for 2022, 12 and 13 for 2021, and 11 each for 2020, of the Company s consolidated net revenues. A disruption in our relationship with any of these customers could adversely affect our business. We could experience fluctuations in our customer base or the mix of revenue by customer as markets and strategies evolve. In addition, any consolidation of our customers could reduce the number of customers to whom our services could be sold. Our inability to meet our customers requirements could adversely impact our revenue. The loss of one or more of our major customers or any significant reduction in the service requirements of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 
 
 The Company s substantial debt could limit its ability to grow and compete. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 6.952 billion of debt, net of unamortized financing costs, discounts and premium, which represented 71.7 of the total combined capitalization. 
 
 The Company s high level of debt could have important consequences for its business. For example, it could: 
 
 limit the Company s ability to borrow additional funds or obtain additional financing in the future; 

limit the Company s ability to pursue acquisition opportunities; 

23 

expose the Company to greater interest rate risk since the interest rates on borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities are variable; 

limit the Company s flexibility to plan for and react to changes in its business and its industry; and 

impair our ability to withstand a general downturn in our business and place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged. 

See Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Material Cash Requirements for disclosure of the approximate aggregate amount of principal indebtedness scheduled to mature. 
 
 The Company could also incur additional debt in the future. The terms of the Company s senior secured credit facilities, as well as the indentures governing Nexstar s 1.714 billion 5.625 senior unsecured notes due 2027 5.625 Notes, due July 2027 and Nexstar s 1.0 billion 4.75 senior unsecured notes due 2028 4.75 Notes, due November 2028 ), limit, but do not prohibit the Company from incurring substantial amounts of additional debt. To the extent the Company incurs additional debt, it would become even more susceptible to the leverage-related risks described above. 
 
 The agreements governing the Company s debt contain various covenants that limit management s discretion in the operation of its business. 
 
 The terms of the Company s senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing Nexstar s 5.625 Notes, due July 2027 and Nexstar s 4.75 Notes, due November 2028 contain various restrictive covenants customary for arrangements of these types that restrict our ability to, among other things: 
 
 incur additional debt and issue preferred stock; 

pay dividends and make other distributions; 

make investments and other restricted payments; 

make acquisitions; 

merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; 

enter into sale and leaseback transactions; 

create liens; 

sell assets or stock of our subsidiaries; and 

enter into transactions with affiliates. 

In addition, Nexstar s senior secured credit facility requires us to maintain or meet certain financial ratios, including a maximum consolidated first lien net leverage ratio. Future financing agreements may contain similar, or even more restrictive, provisions and covenants. Because of these restrictions and covenants, management s ability to operate our business at its discretion is limited, and we may be unable to compete effectively, pursue acquisitions or take advantage of new business opportunities, any of which could harm our business. 
 
 If we fail to comply with the restrictions in present or future financing agreements, a default may occur. A default could allow creditors to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. A default could also allow creditors to foreclose on any collateral securing such debt. 
 
 The credit agreement governing our obligations under our senior secured credit facility contains covenants that require us to comply with a maximum consolidated first lien net leverage ratio of 4.25 to 1.00. The covenants, which are calculated on a quarterly basis, include the combined results of the Company. The credit agreement governing Mission s obligations under its senior secured credit facility do not contain financial covenant ratio requirements; however, they include events of default if we do not comply with all covenants contained in the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facility. 

24 

The Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its debt service requirements. 
 
 The Company s ability to service its debt depends on its ability to generate the necessary cash flow. Generation of the necessary cash flow is partially subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond the Company s control. The Company cannot assure you that its business will generate cash flow from operations, that future borrowings will be available to the Company under its current or any replacement credit facilities, or that it will be able to complete any necessary financings, in amounts sufficient to enable the Company to fund its operations or pay its debts and other obligations, or to fund its liquidity needs. If the Company is not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt obligations, it may need to refinance or restructure its debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. Additional financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, at times or on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. If the Company is unable to meet its debt service obligations, its lenders may determine to stop making loans to the Company, and/or the Company s lenders or other holders of its debt could accelerate and declare due all outstanding obligations under the respective agreements, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
 
 Our growth may be limited if we are unable to implement our acquisition strategy. 
 
 We achieved much of our growth through acquisitions. We intend to continue our growth by selectively pursuing acquisitions of businesses that leverage our platform, scale and capabilities. Some of our competitors may have greater financial or management resources with which to pursue acquisition targets. Therefore, even if we are successful in identifying attractive acquisition targets, we may face considerable competition and our acquisition strategy may not be successful. 
 
 FCC rules and policies may also make it more difficult for us to acquire additional television stations. Television station acquisitions are subject to the approval of the FCC and, potentially, other regulatory authorities. FCC rules limit the ownership of television stations, both in local markets and nationally, and define the types of local service agreements that count as ownership by the party providing the services. Those rules are subject to change. For instance, we currently own several television stations and provide services to other stations pursuant to the recent eliminations and modifications of certain FCC ownership rules. The FCC is required to undertake periodic reviews of its media ownership rules, however, and as a part of any such review it may reimpose prior rules or adopt new rules that limit our ability to make acquisitions or enter into local service agreements, or that require us to divest existing stations or terminate existing agreements. The need for FCC and other regulatory approvals could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions, if, for example, the FCC or other government agencies believe that a proposed transaction would result in excessive concentration or other public interest detriment in a market, even if the proposed combination may otherwise comply with FCC ownership limitations. Additionally, our television acquisitions over the past several years have significantly increased our national audience reach to a level that approaches national television ownership limits imposed by the Communications Act and FCC rules. This may restrict our future television station acquisitions and may require us to divest current stations in connection with any acquisition in order to comply with national television ownership limits. The television broadcast industry has also undergoing significant consolidation, which has reduced the number of acquisition targets. 
 
 Growing our business through acquisitions involves risks and if we are unable to manage effectively our growth, our operating results will suffer. 
 
 In 2022, we completed our acquisition of a 75.0 ownership interest in The CW for no purchase consideration, in 2021 we acquired The Hill and in 2020 we acquired BestReviews. To manage effectively our growth and address the increased reporting requirements and administrative demands that will result from future acquisitions, we will need, among other things, to continue to develop our financial and management controls and management information systems. We will also need to continue to identify, attract and retain highly skilled finance and management personnel. Failure to do any of these tasks in an efficient and timely manner could seriously harm our business. 
 
 There are other risks associated with growing our business through acquisitions. For example, with any past or future acquisition, there is the possibility that: 
 
 we may not be able to successfully reduce costs, increase revenue or audience or realize anticipated synergies and economies of scale with respect to any acquired business; 

we may not be able to generate adequate returns on our acquisitions or investments; 

we may encounter and fail to address risks or other problems associated with or arising from our reliance on the representations and warranties and related indemnities, if any, provided to us by the sellers of acquired companies; 

25 

an acquisition may increase our leverage and debt service requirements or may result in our assuming unexpected liabilities; 

our management may be reassigned from overseeing existing operations by the need to integrate the acquired business; 

we may experience difficulties integrating operations and systems, as well as company policies and cultures; 

we may be unable to retain and grow relationships with the acquired company s key customers; 

we may fail to retain and assimilate employees of the acquired business; and 

problems may arise in entering new markets in which we have little or no experience. 

The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, particularly during the period immediately following any acquisition. 
 
 Changes in FCC rules may restrict our ability to own or provide services to multiple stations in local markets under local service agreements or common ownership, which may harm our existing operations and impair our acquisition strategy. 
 
 In a number of our markets, we have created duopolies by entering into what we refer to as local service agreements. While these agreements take varying forms, a typical local service agreement is an agreement between two separately owned television stations serving the same market, whereby the owner of one station provides operational assistance to the other station, subject to ultimate editorial and other controls being exercised by the latter station s owner. By entering into and operating under local service agreements with same-market stations, we (and the other station) achieve significant operational efficiencies. We also broaden our audience reach and enhance our ability to capture more advertising spending in a given market. Additionally, we achieve significant operational efficiencies by owning multiple stations in a market where FCC rules allow us to do so. 
 
 Our local service agreements with independently owned television stations and our ownership of multiple stations in certain markets comply with current FCC media ownership rules. Those rules, however, are subject to change. For instance, in recent years FCC rules have prohibited us from entering into new JSAs and may have required us to terminate existing JSAs after a certain date. Additionally, for many years the FCC s duopoly rule required at least eight independently owned television stations to remain in a local market for a party to acquire a second station in that market. These restrictions are no longer in effect, but the FCC s 2018 and 2022 quadrennial media ownership reviews are currently pending, and the agency could reinstitute these or other limitations in those or any future reviews. 
 
 We cannot predict what additional or modified media ownership rules the FCC will adopt or when they will be adopted. In addition, uncertainty about media ownership regulations and adverse economic conditions have dampened the acquisition market from time to time, and changes in the regulatory approval process may make materially more expensive, or may materially delay, the Company s ability to consummate further acquisitions in the future. 
 
 We are subject to foreign ownership limitations which limit foreign investments in us. 
 
 The Communications Act limits the extent of non-U.S. ownership of companies that own U.S. broadcast stations. Under these restrictions, the holder of a U.S. broadcast license may have no more than 20 non-U.S. ownership (by vote and by equity). The Communications Act prohibits more than 25 indirect foreign ownership or control of a licensee through a parent company if the FCC determines the public interest will be served by enforcement of such restriction. The FCC has interpreted this provision to require an affirmative public interest showing before indirect foreign ownership of a broadcast licensee may exceed 25 . Therefore, certain investors may be prevented from investing in us if our foreign ownership is at or near the FCC limits. 

26 

The FCC s and DOJ s local and national media ownership rules limit our ability to acquire television stations in particular markets, restricting our ability to execute our acquisition strategy. 
 
 The number of television stations we may acquire in any local market or nationwide is limited by FCC rules and may potentially also be impacted by actions and policies of the U.S. Department of Justice and other regulatory authorities. Our ability to acquire television stations may also vary depending upon whether the interests in other television stations of persons affiliated with us are attributable under FCC rules. The broadcast television interests of our officers, directors and most stockholders with 5 or greater voting power are attributable under the FCC s rules, which may limit us from acquiring or owning television stations in particular markets while those officers, directors or stockholders are associated with us. In addition, the holder of otherwise non-attributable equity and/or debt in a licensee in excess of 33 of the total debt and equity of the licensee will be attributable where the holder is either a major program supplier to that licensee or the holder has an attributable interest in another media facility in the same market that is subject to the FCC s media ownership rules. 
 
 The FCC may deny renewal of the FCC license of any of the stations we operate or provide services to, requiring that station to cease operation. 
 
 Television broadcast licenses are granted for a maximum term of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application to the FCC. The FCC is required to grant an application for license renewal if, during the preceding term, the station served the public interest, the licensee did not commit any serious violations of the Communications Act or the FCC s rules, and the licensee committed no other violations of the Communications Act or the FCC s rules which, taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse. A majority of renewal applications are routinely granted under this standard. If a licensee fails to meet this standard the FCC may still grant renewal on terms and conditions that it deems appropriate, including a monetary forfeiture or renewal for a term less than the normal eight-year period. However, in an extreme case, the FCC may deny a station s license renewal application, resulting in termination of the station s authority to broadcast. Under the Communications Act, the term of a broadcast license is automatically extended during the pendency of the FCC s processing of a timely renewal application. We are filing applications to renew our television licenses on a rolling schedule ending in April 2023. The Company expects the FCC to grant pending and future renewal applications for its stations in due course but cannot provide any assurances that the FCC will do so. 
 
 The financial performance of our equity method investments could adversely impact our results of operations. 
 
 We have significant investments in businesses (primarily our 31.3 interest in TV Food Network) that we account for under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, we report our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of our equity affiliates in our Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income under Income from equity method investments, net, which contributes to our income from continuing operations before income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our income from equity investments from TV Food Network was 226.7 million, less the amortization of basis difference of 69.5 million (as described in more detail in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). During this period, we also received cash distributions from TV Food Network of 249.4 million. If the earnings or losses of and distributions from our equity investments are material in any year, those earnings or losses and distributions may have a material effect on our net income, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity. We do not control the day-to-day operations of our equity method investments or have the ability to cause them to pay dividends or make other payments or advances to their stockholders, including us, and thus the management of these businesses could impact our results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, these businesses are subject to laws, regulations, market conditions and other risks inherent in their operations. Any of these factors could adversely impact our results of operations, our cash flows and the value of our investment. 
 
 We have made investments in digital businesses. 
 
 We have invested in content-driven digital businesses as well as digital offerings through our broadcast stations. Due to intense competition, investment in content that is subject to a greater degree of obsolescence, historical impairment losses on our digital assets, significant reliance on third-party vendors to deliver services, limited operating history, the rapid evolving nature of digital businesses and difficulties in integrating acquisitions into our operations, the future operating results could be volatile and may negatively impact the year-to-year trends of our operations. 

27 

The loss of the services of our chief executive officer could disrupt management of our business and impair the execution of our business strategies. 
 
 We believe that our success depends upon our ability to retain the services of Perry A. Sook, our founder and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Sook has been instrumental in determining our strategic direction and focus. The loss of Mr. Sook s services could adversely affect our ability to manage effectively our overall operations and successfully execute current or future business strategies. On August 1, 2022, we extended Mr. Sook s appointment as our Chief Executive Officer through March 31, 2026, with automatic renewal for successive one-year periods. 
 
 The owners of the VIEs may make decisions regarding the operation of their respective stations that could reduce the amount of cash we receive under our local service agreements. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, the VIEs are each 100 owned by independent third parties. These entities own and operate 36 full power television stations, of which 35 stations are included in our financial statements as consolidated VIEs. We have entered into local service agreements with the VIEs, pursuant to which we provide services to their stations. In return for the services we provide, we receive substantially all of the consolidated VIEs available cash, after satisfaction of their operating costs and any debt obligations. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, Mission s senior secured credit facility consisted of a Term Loan B, due June 2028 with an outstanding principal balance of 296.3 million and a 75.0 million revolving credit facility, of which 61.5 million was drawn and outstanding. 
 
 Nexstar (excluding The CW) guarantees full payment of all of the obligations incurred under Mission s senior secured credit facility in the event of its default. All of the consolidated VIEs have granted purchase options that permit Nexstar to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each of those VIEs stations, subject to FCC consent. These purchase options are freely exercisable or assignable by Nexstar without consent or approval by the VIEs. 
 
 We do not own the VIEs or any of their respective television stations. However, we are deemed under U.S. GAAP to have controlling financial interests in the consolidated VIEs because of (i) the local service agreements Nexstar has with the consolidated VIEs stations, (ii) Nexstar s (excluding The CW) guarantee of the obligations incurred under Mission s senior secured credit facility, (iii) Nexstar having power over significant activities affecting the consolidated VIEs economic performance, including budgeting for advertising revenue, advertising sales and, in some cases, hiring and firing of sales force personnel and (iv) purchase options granted by each consolidated VIE which permit Nexstar to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each of the consolidated VIEs stations at any time, subject to FCC consent. 
 
 In compliance with FCC regulations, the VIEs maintain complete responsibility for and control over programming, finances and personnel for their respective stations. As a result, the VIEs boards of directors and officers can make decisions with which we disagree and which could reduce the cash flow generated by these stations and, as a consequence, the amounts we receive under our local service agreements with the VIEs. For instance, the VIEs may decide to obtain and broadcast programming which, in our opinion, would prove unpopular and/or would generate less advertising revenue.

The Company has a material amount of goodwill and intangible assets, and therefore the Company could suffer losses due to future asset impairment charges. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, 8.305 billion, or 65.5 , of the Company s combined total assets consisted of goodwill and intangible assets, including FCC licenses and network affiliation agreements. During the fourth quarter of 2022, Nexstar recorded a 90.8 million goodwill impairment attributable to a digital business. The Company tests goodwill and FCC licenses annually, and on an interim date if factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test of these assets, in accordance with accounting and disclosure requirements for goodwill and other intangible assets. The Company tests its finite-lived intangible assets whenever circumstances or indicators become apparent that the asset may not be recoverable through expected future cash flows. The methods used to evaluate the impairment of the Company s goodwill and intangible assets would be affected by a significant reduction, or a forecast of such reductions, in operating results or cash flows at the Company s business units. The broadcast business s operating results and cash flows could be affected by a significant adverse change in the advertising marketplaces in which the Company s television stations operate, the loss of network affiliations or by adverse changes to FCC ownership rules, among other things, which may be beyond the Company s control. Our digital business s operating results and cash flows could be affected by intense competition, investment in technologies that are subject to a greater degree of obsolescence, significant reliance on third-party partners to deliver services, rapid evolving nature and other factors. If the carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets is revised downward due to impairment, such non-cash charge could materially affect the Company s financial position and results of operations. 
 
 The recording of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in the future or the impact of tax law changes on such deferred tax assets could affect our operating results. 
 
 The Company currently has significant net deferred tax assets resulting from tax credit carryforwards, net operating losses and other deductible temporary differences that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods. Based on our assessment of the Company s deferred tax assets, we determined that as of December 31, 2022, based on projected future income, approximately 199.4 million of the Company s deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, will more likely than not be realized in the future. Should we determine in the future that these assets will not be realized, the Company will be required to record a valuation allowance in connection with these deferred tax assets and the Company s operating results would be adversely affected in the period such determination is made. In addition, tax law changes could negatively impact the Company s deferred tax assets. 
 
 The Company s ability to use net operating loss carry-forwards NOLs to reduce future tax payments may be limited if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels or there is a change in ownership of Nexstar, Mission or certain of our other VIEs. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company had NOLs of approximately 165.7 million for U.S. federal tax purposes and 153.7 million for state tax purposes. A valuation allowance has been recorded against 134.3 million of federal NOLs and 71.7 million of state NOLs attributable to a consolidated VIE. Federal NOLs generated for years prior to 2018 expire at varying dates through 2037 and NOLs generated after 2017 carry forward indefinitely. To the extent available, we intend to use these NOLs to reduce the corporate income tax liability associated with our operations. Section 382 Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of NOLs that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone an ownership change. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders or public groups, which are generally outside of our control. The Company s NOLs are subject to limitations under Section 382. As of December 31, 2022, the Company does not expect any NOLs to expire as a result of a Section 382 limitation. 
 
 The ability to use NOLs is also dependent upon the Company s ability to generate taxable income. The NOLs could expire before the Company generates sufficient taxable income to use them. To the extent the Company s use of NOLs is significantly limited, the Company s income could be subject to corporate income tax earlier than it would if it were able to use NOLs, which could have a negative effect on the Company s financial results and operations. Changes in ownership are largely beyond the Company s control and the Company can give no assurance that it will continue to have realizable NOLs.

We could face additional tax-related liabilities if the IRS prevails on a proposed income tax audit adjustment related to a past transaction of Tribune. We may also face additional tax liabilities stemming from an ongoing federal income tax audit of Tribune. 
 
 While we believe our tax positions and reserves are reasonable, the resolutions of certain tax issues related to a past transaction of Tribune Media Company Tribune are unpredictable and could negatively impact our effective tax rate, net income or cash flows for the period or periods in question. Specifically, we may be faced with additional tax liabilities as a result of our acquisition of Tribune for the transactions contemplated by an agreement, dated August 21, 2009, between Tribune and Chicago Entertainment Ventures, LLC (formerly Chicago Baseball Holdings, LLC) CEV LLC ), and its subsidiaries (collectively, New Cubs LLC ), governing the contribution of certain assets and liabilities related to the business of the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball franchise then owned by Tribune and its subsidiaries to New Cubs LLC, and related agreements thereto (the Chicago Cubs Transactions ). We may also be faced with tax liabilities as a result of the federal income tax audits of Tribune for taxable years 2014 and 2015. 
 
 On June 28, 2016, the IRS issued Tribune a Notice of Deficiency which presented the IRS s position that the gain with respect to the Chicago Cubs Transactions should have been included in Tribune s 2009 taxable income. Accordingly, the IRS proposed a 182.0 million tax and a 73.0 million gross valuation misstatement penalty. During the third quarter of 2016, Tribune filed a petition in U.S. Tax Court to contest the IRS s determination. After-tax interest on the aforementioned proposed tax and penalty through December 31, 2022 would be approximately 158.0 million. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its position, under the tax rules for determining tax basis upon emergence from bankruptcy, the Company would be required to reduce its tax basis in certain assets. The reduction in tax basis would be required to reflect the reduction in the amount of the Company s guarantee of the New Cubs partnership debt which was included in the reported tax basis previously determined upon emergence from bankruptcy and subject to Tribune s 2014 and 2015 federal income tax audits (described below). 
 
 On September 19, 2019, Tribune became a wholly owned subsidiary of Nexstar following Nexstar s merger with Tribune. Nexstar disagrees with the IRS s position that the Chicago Cubs Transactions generated taxable gain in 2009, the proposed penalty and the IRS s calculation of the gain. If the IRS prevails in its position, the gain on the Chicago Cubs Transactions would be deemed to be taxable in 2009. We estimate that the federal and state income taxes would be approximately 225.0 million before interest and penalties. Any tax, interest and penalty due will be offset by tax payments made relating to this transaction subsequent to 2009. Tribune made approximately 154.0 million of tax payments prior to its merger with Nexstar. 
 
 A bench trial in the U.S. Tax Court took place between October 28, 2019 and November 8, 2019, and closing arguments took place on December 11, 2019. The Tax Court issued a separate opinion on January 6, 2020 holding that the IRS satisfied the procedural requirements for the imposition of the gross valuation misstatement penalty. The judge deferred any litigation of the penalty until the tax issue has been resolved by the Tax Court. 
 
 On October 26, 2021, the Tax Court issued an opinion related to the Chicago Cubs Transactions, which held that Tribune s structure was, in substantial part, in compliance with partnership provisions of the Code and, as a result, did not trigger the entire 2009 taxable gain proposed by the IRS. On October 19, 2022, the Tax Court entered the decision that there is no tax deficiency or penalty due in the 2009 tax year. On January 13, 2023, the IRS filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. On February 3, 2023, the Company filed a notice of cross-appeal. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we believe the tax impact of applying the Tax Court opinion is not material to the Company s accounting for uncertain tax positions or to its Consolidated Financial Statements. Although management believes its estimates and judgments are reasonable, the timing and ultimate resolution are unpredictable and could materially change. 
 
 Prior to Nexstar s merger with Tribune in September 2019, Tribune was undergoing a federal income tax audit for taxable years 2014 and 2015. In the third quarter of 2020, the IRS completed its audit and issued a Revenue Agent s Report which disallowed the reporting of certain assets and liabilities related to Tribune s emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy on December 31, 2012. We disagree with the IRS s proposed adjustments to the tax basis of certain assets and the related taxable income impact, and we are contesting the adjustments through the IRS administrative appeal procedures. If the IRS prevails in its position and after taking into account the impact of the Tax Court opinion, Nexstar would be required to reduce its tax basis in certain assets resulting in a 16.0 million increase in its federal and state taxes payable and a 70.0 million increase in deferred income tax liability as of December 31, 2022. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 740, the Company has reflected 11.0 million for certain contested issues in its liability for uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Nexstar s pension and other postretirement benefit plans (OPEB) are currently underfunded. A declining stock market and lower interest rates could affect the value of the Company s retirement plan assets and increase its postretirement obligations. 
 
 Nexstar has various funded, qualified non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans which cover certain employees and former employees. As of December 31, 2022, the pension benefit obligations for these qualified retirement plans were 1.738 billion. The qualified retirement plans also had 1.562 billion in total net assets available, or underfunded by approximately 175.5 million, to pay benefits to participants enrolled in the plans as of December 31, 2022. Nexstar was not required and did not make contributions to its qualified pension benefit plans in 2022. 
 
 Nexstar also has non-contributory unfunded supplemental executive retirement and ERISA excess plans which supplement the coverage of the defined benefit retirement plans to certain employees and former employees. During 2022, Nexstar contributed 4.1 million to these plans. As of December 31, 2022, the total liability was 41.4 million. Nexstar also has various retiree medical savings account plans which reimburse eligible retired employees for certain medical expenses and unfunded plans that provide certain health and life insurance benefits to certain retired employees. Although Nexstar has frozen participation and benefits under all plans, two significant elements in determining the pension expense or credit are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used in projecting obligations. Large declines in the stock market and lower discount rates increase the expense and may necessitate higher cash contributions to the qualified retirement plans. 
 
 There can be no assurances concerning continuing dividend payments and any decrease or suspension of the dividend could cause our stock price to decline. 
 
 Our common stockholders are only entitled to receive the dividends declared by our board of directors. Our board of directors declared in 2022 a total cash dividend of 3.60 per share (in equal quarterly installments of 0.90 per share) to the outstanding shares of our common stock. In January 2023, our board of directors approved a 50 increase in the quarterly cash dividend to 1.35 per share beginning with the dividend declared in the first quarter of 2023. We expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends at the rate set forth in our current dividend policy. However, future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and can be changed or discontinued at any time. Dividend determinations (including the amount of the cash dividend, the record date and date of payment) will depend upon, among other things, our future operations and earnings, targeted future acquisitions, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, the Company s senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our existing notes limit our ability to pay dividends. Given these considerations, our board of directors may increase or decrease the amount of the dividend at any time and may also decide to suspend or discontinue the payment of cash dividends in the future. 
 
 We cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance long-term stockholder value, and share repurchases could increase the volatility of our stock prices. 
 
 We engage in share repurchases of our common stock from time to time in accordance with authorizations from our board of directors. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. Further, our share repurchases could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our common stock. 
 
 Adverse results from litigation or governmental investigations involving us can impact our business practices and operating results. 
 
 We are party to various litigation and regulatory, environmental and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies. Adverse outcomes in lawsuits or investigations may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that may adversely affect our operating results or financial condition as well as our ability to conduct our businesses as they are presently being conducted. 

31 

We may not be able to adequately protect the intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business, or to defend successfully against intellectual property infringement claims by third parties. 
 
 Our business relies on a combination of patented and patent-pending technology, trademarks, trade names, copyrights, and other proprietary rights, as well as contractual arrangements, including licenses, to establish and protect its technology, intellectual property and brand names. We believe our proprietary technology, trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to our continued success and our competitive position. Any impairment of any such intellectual property or brands could adversely impact the results of our operations or financial condition. 
 
 We seek to limit the threat of content piracy; however, policing unauthorized use of our broadcasts, products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken by us may not in every case prevent infringement by unauthorized third parties. Developments in technology increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute pirated material. Our use of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and trademark, copyright, unfair competition, trade secret and other laws to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology may not be adequate. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary technology, or to defend against claims by third parties that the conduct of our businesses or our use of intellectual property infringes upon such third party s intellectual property rights. Protection of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the U.S. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. If those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. There can be no assurance that our efforts to enforce our rights and protect our products, services and intellectual property will be successful in preventing content piracy. 
 
 Furthermore, any intellectual property litigation or claims brought against us, whether or not meritorious, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. The terms of any settlement or judgment may require us to pay substantial amounts to the other party or cease exercising our rights in such intellectual property. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party s rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected as a result. 

Cybersecurity risks could affect the Company s operating effectiveness. 
 
 The Company uses computers in substantially all aspects of its business operations. Its revenues are increasingly dependent on digital products. Such use exposes the Company to potential cyber incidents resulting from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. It is not uncommon for a company such as ours to be subjected to continuous attempted cyber-attacks or other malicious efforts to cause a cyber incident. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. The changes in our work environment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could also impact the security of our systems, as well as our ability to protect against attacks and detect and respond to them quickly. The rapid adoption of some third-party services designed to enable the transition to a remote workforce also may introduce security risk that is not fully mitigated prior to the use of these services. We may also be subject to increased cyber-attacks, such as phishing attacks by threat actors using the attention placed on the pandemic as a method for targeting our personnel. And we may face additional cyber-attacks as threat actors use supply chain or third-party attacks as a method for penetrating our computer systems. The possible consequences of such an attack include but are not limited to loss of data, damage to the Company s reputation, interruptions to our operations, and/or the need to pay ransom. The results of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, business interruption, disclosure of nonpublic information, decreased advertising revenues, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence. The Company s Cybersecurity Committee helps mitigate cybersecurity risks. The role of the committee is to oversee cyber risk assessments, monitor applicable key risk indicators, review cybersecurity training procedures, establish cybersecurity policies and procedures, and to invest in and implement enhancements to the Company s cybersecurity infrastructure. Investments over the past year included enhancements to monitoring systems, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.

Our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the continuing effects of COVID-19. 
 
 Our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition have been, and may continue to be affected by the macroeconomic impacts resulting from COVID-19. In 2022 and in 2021, the Company continued to recover from the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic since its adverse impact in 2020. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the Company s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will depend on future developments, which remain highly uncertain, cannot reasonably be predicted and many of which are outside of our control, including the persistence of the pandemic, impacts on economic activity, and the possibility of recession or continued financial market instability. 
 Risks Related to Our Industry 
 
 Our operating results are dependent on advertising revenue and as a result, we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and other factors beyond our control than businesses not dependent on advertising. 
 
 We derive a significant amount of our revenue from the sale of advertising time on our stations and community portal websites. Our ability to sell advertising time depends on numerous factors that may be beyond our control, including: 
 
 the health of the economy in the local markets where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole; 

the popularity of our station and website programming; 

fluctuations in pricing for local and national advertising; 

the activities of our competitors, including increased competition from other forms of advertising-based media, particularly digital media, cable television, newspapers and radio; 

the decreased demand for political advertising in non-election years; and 

changes in the makeup of the population in the areas where our stations are located. 

Because businesses generally reduce their advertising budgets during economic recessions or downturns, our reliance upon advertising revenue makes our operating results susceptible to prevailing economic conditions. In addition, our programming may not attract sufficient targeted viewership, and we may not achieve favorable ratings. Our ratings depend partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control, such as viewer preferences, competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities. A shift in viewer preferences could cause our programming not to gain popularity or to decline in popularity, which could cause our advertising revenue to decline. Further, we and the programming providers upon which we rely may not be able to anticipate, and effectively react to, shifts in viewer tastes and interests in our markets. 
 
 Because a high percentage of our operating expense is fixed, a relatively small decrease in revenue could have a significant negative impact on our financial results. 
 
 Our business is characterized generally by high fixed costs, primarily for debt service, broadcast rights and personnel. Other than commissions paid to our sales staff and outside sales agencies, our expenses do not vary significantly with an increase or decrease in advertising revenue. As a result, a relatively small change in advertising prices could have a disproportionate effect on our financial results. Accordingly, a minor shortfall in expected revenue could have a significant negative impact on our financial results. 
 
 Preemption of regularly scheduled programming by news coverage may affect our revenue and results of operations. 
 
 The Company may experience a loss of advertising revenue and incur additional broadcasting expenses due to preemption of our regularly scheduled programming by network coverage of a major global news event such as a war or terrorist attack or by coverage of local disasters such as tornados and hurricanes. As a result, advertising may not be aired and the revenue for such advertising may be lost unless the station is able to run the advertising at agreed-upon times in the future. Advertisers may not agree to run such advertising in future time periods, and space may not be available for such advertising. The duration of any preemption of programming cannot be predicted if it occurs. In addition, our stations and the stations we provide services to may incur additional expenses as a result of expanded news coverage of a war or terrorist attack or local disaster. The resulting loss of revenue and increased expenses could negatively affect our results of operations. 

33 

If we are unable to respond to changes in technology and evolving industry trends, our television businesses may not be able to compete effectively. 
 
 New technologies may adversely affect our television stations. Information delivery and programming alternatives such as online distribution of programming, the internet, cable, direct satellite-to-home services, pay-per-view, video on demand, telephone company services, mobile devices, digital video recorders and home video and entertainment systems have fractionalized television viewing audiences and expanded the numbers and types of distribution channels for advertisers to access. Over the past decade, cable television programming services, other emerging video distribution platforms and the internet have captured an increasing market share, while the aggregate viewership of the major broadcast television networks has declined. In addition, the expansion of cable and satellite television, video streaming and other technological changes has increased, and may continue to increase, the competitive demand for programming. Such increased demand, together with rising production costs, may increase our programming costs or impair our ability to acquire or develop desired programming. 
 
 In addition, video compression techniques now in use are expected to permit greater numbers of channels to be carried within existing bandwidth. These compression techniques and other technological developments are applicable to all video delivery systems, including over-the-air broadcasting, and have the potential to provide vastly expanded programming to targeted audiences. Reduction in the cost of creating additional channel capacity could lower entry barriers for new channels and encourage the development of increasingly specialized niche programming, resulting in more audience fractionalization. This ability to reach very narrowly defined audiences may alter the competitive dynamics for advertising expenditures. Furthermore, the FCC has authorized television broadcasters to transmit using a so-called Next Gen (ATSC 3.0) standard on a voluntary, market-driven basis. This new transmission standard may allow broadcast television stations to provide a multitude of enhanced services to consumers, including but not limited to the delivery of ultra-high definition video and advanced audio to home and mobile screens, new public safety capabilities such as advanced emergency alerting, and localized, personalized and interactive content. We are unable to predict the effect that these and other technological changes will have on the television industry or our results of operations. 
 
 The FCC can sanction us for programming broadcast on our stations which it finds to be indecent. 
 
 The FCC may impose substantial fines, exceeding 400,000 per violation (and subject to annual adjustments for inflation), on television broadcasters for the broadcast of indecent material in violation of the Communications Act and its rules. Because the Company s programming is in large part comprised of programming provided by the networks with which the stations are affiliated, the Company does not have full control over what is broadcast on its stations and may be subject to the imposition of fines if the FCC finds such programming to be indecent. 
 
 In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court decided a challenge to the FCC s indecency enforcement without resolving the constitutionality of such enforcement, and the FCC thereafter requested public comment on the appropriate substance and scope of its indecency enforcement policy. The FCC has issued very few further decisions or rules in this area, and the courts may in the future have further occasion to review the FCC s current policy or any modifications thereto. The outcomes of these proceedings could affect future FCC policies in this area and could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 Intense competition in the television industry and alternative forms of media could limit our growth and profitability. 
 
 As a television broadcasting company, we face a significant level of competition, both directly and indirectly. We generally compete for our audience against all the other leisure activities in which one could choose to engage rather than watch television. Specifically, stations we own or provide services to compete for audience share, programming and advertising revenue with other television stations in their respective markets and with other advertising media, including newspapers, radio stations, cable television, DBS systems, mobile services, video streaming services and the internet. 
 
 The entertainment and television industries are highly competitive and are undergoing a period of consolidation. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial, marketing, programming and broadcasting resources than we do. The markets in which we operate are also in a constant state of change arising from, among other things, technological improvements and economic and regulatory developments. Technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of television entertainment, such as cable television, wireless cable, satellite-to-home distribution services, pay-per-view, home video and entertainment systems and internet and mobile distribution of video programming have fractionalized television viewing audiences and have subjected free over-the-air television broadcast stations to increased competition. We may not be able to compete effectively or adjust our business plans to meet changing market conditions.

Technologies used in the entertainment industry continue to evolve rapidly, leading to alternative methods for the delivery and storage of digital content. These technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior and have empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume news and entertainment, including through the so-called cutting the cord and other consumption strategies. The networks are also streaming their programming on the internet and other distribution platforms simultaneously with, or in close proximity to, network programming broadcast on local television stations, including those we own or provide services to. These innovations and other practices by the networks dilute the exclusivity and value of network programming historically broadcast by the local stations and may adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of our stations. We are unable to predict what forms of competition will develop in the future, the extent of the competition or its possible effects on our business. 
 
 The FCC could implement regulations or the U.S. Congress could adopt legislation that might have a significant impact on the operations of the stations we own and the stations we provide services to or the television broadcasting industry as a whole. 
 
 The FCC has open proceedings to determine whether to standardize TV stations reporting of programming responsive to local needs and interests; whether to modify its network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules; whether to modify its standards for good faith retransmission consent negotiations; and whether to broaden the definition of MVPD to include online video programming distributors. Additionally, the FCC has initiated its 2018 and 2022 quadrennial proceedings to review the agency s media ownership rules and has opened a proceeding to review the national television broadcast ownership limit. The FCC also may decide to initiate other new rule-making proceedings on its own or in response to requests from outside parties, any of which might impact our business or operations. The U.S. Congress may also act to amend the Communications Act in a manner that could impact our stations and the stations we provide services to or the television broadcast industry in general. 
 
 The FCC has reallocated a portion of the spectrum available for use by television broadcasters to wireless broadband use, which could substantially impact our future operations and may reduce viewer access to our programming. 
 
 The FCC has repurposed a portion of the broadcast television spectrum for wireless broadband use. Pursuant to federal legislation enacted in 2012, the FCC conducted an incentive auction in 2016-17 for the purpose of making additional spectrum available to meet future wireless broadband needs. Under the auction statute and rules, certain television broadcasters accepted bids from the FCC to voluntarily relinquish their spectrum in exchange for consideration, and certain wireless broadband providers and other entities submitted successful bids to acquire the relinquished television spectrum. Television stations that did not relinquish their spectrum were repacked into the frequency band still remaining for television broadcast use. 
 
 The Company has received payment for eleven television stations that accepted bids and have either moved to different channels or (in one case) discontinued operation. Seventy-four (74) full power stations owned by Nexstar and 17 full power stations owned by VIEs were assigned to new channels in the reduced post-auction television band. These stations have commenced operation on their new assigned channels and have ceased operating on their former channels. The Company is in the final stages of requesting and receiving reimbursements for the costs of repacking these stations. 
 
 The reallocation of television spectrum to broadband use may be to the detriment of our investment in digital facilities, could require substantial additional investment to continue our current operations, and may require viewers to invest in additional equipment or subscription services to continue receiving broadcast television signals. We cannot yet fully predict the impact of the incentive auction and subsequent repack on our business. 

Risks Related to Tribune s Emergence from Bankruptcy 
 
 We may incur unforeseen costs in connection with Tribune s Chapter 11 proceedings. 
 
 On December 31, 2012, certain entities (including Tribune and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries) that had filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the Bankruptcy Court on December 8, 2008 (or on October 12, 2009, in the case of Tribune CNLBC, LLC) (the Debtors emerged from Chapter 11. Tribune s Chapter 11 case has not yet been closed by the Bankruptcy Court. As a result, we expect to continue to incur certain expenses pertaining to the Chapter 11 proceedings in future periods, which may be material. In addition, while we believe that all claims asserted in the Chapter 11 cases have been finally resolved (with the exception of one claim that has been disallowed but remains on appeal), creditors may seek to submit additional late-filed claims in Tribune s Chapter 11 case, which if allowed by the Bankruptcy Court may result in additional costs and payments, which may be material.

Risks Related to Tribune Publishing s Spin-Off 
 
 If the Tribune Publishing Company Tribune Publishing spin-off does not qualify as a tax-free distribution under Section 355 of the Code, including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of stock of Tribune or Tribune Publishing, then Tribune may be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes. 
 
 On August 4, 2014, Tribune completed a separation transaction, resulting in the spin-off of the assets (other than owned real estate and certain other assets) and certain liabilities of the businesses primarily related to Tribune s then principal publishing operations through a tax-free, pro rata dividend to its stockholders and warrant holders of 98.5 of the shares of common stock of Tribune Publishing. At that time, Tribune retained 1.5 of the outstanding common stock of Tribune Publishing. The publishing operations consisted of newspaper publishing and local news and information gathering functions that operated daily newspapers and related websites, as well as a number of ancillary businesses that leveraged certain of the assets of those businesses. As a result of the completion of the spin-off, Tribune Publishing operates the Publishing Business as an independent, publicly-traded company. On January 31, 2017, Tribune sold its remaining Tribune Publishing shares. 
 
 In connection with the Tribune Publishing spin-off, Tribune received a private letter ruling (the IRS Ruling from the IRS to the effect that the distribution and certain related transactions qualified as tax-free to Tribune, its then stockholders and warrant holders and Tribune Publishing for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Although a private letter ruling from the IRS generally is binding on the IRS, the IRS Ruling did not rule that the distribution satisfies every requirement for a tax-free distribution, and the parties have relied on the opinion of special tax counsel, Debevoise Plimpton LLP, to the effect that the distribution and certain related transactions qualified as tax-free to Tribune and its then stockholders and warrant holders. The opinion of the special tax counsel relied on the IRS Ruling as to matters covered by it. 
 
 The IRS Ruling and the opinion of the special tax counsel were based on, among other things, certain representations and assumptions as to factual matters made by Tribune and certain of its then stockholders. The failure of any factual representation or assumption to be true, correct and complete in all material respects could adversely affect the validity of the IRS Ruling or the opinion of the special tax counsel. An opinion of counsel represents counsel s best legal judgment, is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the IRS or the courts may not agree with the opinion. In addition, the IRS Ruling and the opinion of the special tax counsel were based on the current law then in effect, and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect. If the Tribune Publishing spin-off is ultimately determined not to be tax-free, we could be liable for the U.S. federal and state income taxes imposed as a result of the transaction. Furthermore, events subsequent to the distribution could cause us to recognize a taxable gain in connection therewith. Although Tribune Publishing is required to indemnify us against taxes on the distribution that arise after the distribution as a result of actions or failures to act by Tribune Publishing or any member thereof, Tribune Publishing s failure to meet such obligations and our administrative and legal costs in enforcing such obligations may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. 

Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws and Delaware corporate law may permit a court to void the Tribune Publishing spin-off, which would adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations. 
 
 In connection with the Tribune Publishing spin-off, Tribune undertook several corporate reorganization transactions which, along with the contribution of the Tribune Publishing business, the distribution of Tribune Publishing shares and the cash dividend that was paid to Tribune, may be subject to challenge under federal and state fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws as well as under Delaware corporate law, even though the Tribune Publishing spin-off has been completed. Under applicable laws, any transaction, contribution or distribution contemplated as part of the Tribune Publishing spin-off could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if, among other things, the transferor received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for, and was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of, the transfer. 
 
 We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not any entity involved in the Tribune Publishing spin-off was insolvent at the relevant time. In general, however, a court would look at various facts and circumstances related to the entity in question, including evaluation of whether or not: 
 
 the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the fair market value of all of its assets; 

the present fair market value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or 

it could pay its debts as they become due. 

36 

If a court were to find that any transaction, contribution or distribution involved in the Tribune Publishing spin-off was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could void the transaction, contribution or distribution. In addition, the distribution could also be voided if a court were to find that it is not a legal distribution or dividend under Delaware corporate law. The resulting complications, costs and expenses of either finding would materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We may be exposed to additional liabilities as a result of the Tribune Publishing spin-off. 
 
 The separation and distribution agreement Tribune entered into in connection with the Tribune Publishing spin-off sets forth the distribution of assets, liabilities, rights and obligations of Tribune and Tribune Publishing following the spin-off, and includes indemnification obligations for such liabilities and obligations. In addition, pursuant to the tax matters agreement, certain income tax liabilities and related responsibilities are allocated between, and indemnification obligations have been assumed by, each of Tribune and Tribune Publishing. In connection with the Tribune Publishing spin-off, Tribune also entered into an employee matters agreement, pursuant to which certain obligations with respect to employee benefit plans were allocated to Tribune Publishing. Each company will rely on the other company to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. Certain of the liabilities to be assumed or indemnified by Tribune or Tribune Publishing under these agreements are legal or contractual liabilities of the other company. However, it could be later determined that Tribune must retain certain of the liabilities allocated to Tribune Publishing pursuant to these agreements, including with respect to certain multiemployer benefit plans, which amounts could be material. Furthermore, if Tribune Publishing were to breach or be unable to satisfy its material obligations under these agreements, including a failure to satisfy its indemnification obligations, Tribune could suffer operational difficulties or significant losses.

 Item 2.	Pr operties 
 We have office space for our corporate headquarters in Irving, TX, which is leased through 2033. Each of our markets has facilities consisting of offices, studios, sales offices and tower and transmitter sites. We own approximately 54 of our office and studio locations and approximately 57 of our tower and transmitter locations. The remaining properties that we utilize in our operations are leased. We consider all of our properties, together with equipment contained therein, to be adequate for our present needs. We continually evaluate our future needs and from time to time will undertake significant projects to replace or upgrade facilities. 
 While none of our owned or leased properties is individually material to our operations, if we were required to relocate any towers, the cost could be significant. This is because the number of sites in any geographic area that permit a tower of reasonable height to provide good coverage of the market is limited, and zoning and other land use restrictions, as well as Federal Aviation Administration and FCC regulations, limit the number of alternative locations or increase the cost of acquiring them for tower sites. See Item 1, Business The Stations for a complete list of stations by market.

 Market Prices; Record Holders and Dividends 
 Our common stock (f/k/a Class A common stock) trades on The NASDAQ Global Select Market NASDAQ under the symbol NXST. 
 
 As of February 27, 2023, there were approximately 107,000 shareholders of record of our common stock, including shares held in nominee names by brokers and other institutions. 
 Pursuant to our current dividend policy, our board of directors declared in 2022, 2021 and 2020 total annual cash dividends of 3.60 per share, 2.80 per share and 2.24 per share, respectively, with respect to outstanding shares of our common stock. The dividends were paid in equal quarterly installments. 
 On January 26, 2023, our board of directors approved a 50 increase in the quarterly cash dividend to 1.35 per share of outstanding common stock beginning with the first quarter of 2023. Dividend determinations will depend upon, among other things, our future operations and earnings, targeted future acquisitions, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. Additionally, the Company s senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing Nexstar s existing notes limit our ability to pay dividends. Given these considerations, our board of directors may increase or decrease the amount of dividends at any time and may also decide to suspend or discontinue the payment of cash dividends in the future.

 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 As a result of our deemed controlling financial interests in the consolidated VIEs in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we consolidate the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of these VIEs as if they were wholly-owned entities. We believe this presentation is meaningful for understanding our financial performance. Refer to Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our determinations of VIE consolidation under the related authoritative guidance. The following discussion of our financial position and results of operations includes the consolidated VIEs financial position and results of operations. 
 Executive Summary 
 2022 Highlights 
 Achieved record 5.2 billion of net revenue for 2022, surpassing the 5.0 billion milestone for the first time, including a record 505.6 million of non-presidential election year political advertising revenue. 

Returned over 1.0 billion of capital to shareholders through repurchases of common stock of 880.7 million and dividends of 142.2 million, funded by cash on hand. 

Successfully renewed distribution agreements with over half our subscriber base. 

Successfully extended affiliation agreement with ABC to 2026. 

Acquired a 75 ownership interest in The CW Network for no consideration which acquisition was strategically important to support our CW-affiliated stations and to drive the overall growth of our national platform. 

Expanded news programming at NewsNation, America s fastest growing cable news network, to 17 hours per weekday of national news, analysis, and talk. 

Launched FAST channels for The Hill and CTV/OTT apps for NewsNation on a variety of platforms. 

Deployed NEXTGEN TV (or ATSC 3.0) in an additional 20 markets to a total of 37 markets. 

Completed the 3.05 billion refinancing of near-term maturities while reducing interest expense. 

Net reduction in debt of 477.6 million, funded by cash on hand. 

Eliminated Nexstar s Class B and Class C common stock via an amendment to Nexstar s certificate of incorporation approved by Nexstar shareholders on June 13, 2022. 

2022 Acquisition of The CW 
 On September 30, 2022, Nexstar acquired a 75.0 ownership interest in The CW from the Sellers for no purchase consideration. Each of the Sellers retained a 12.5 ownership interest and will produce 12 original, scripted series for The CW primarily to air during the 2022/2023 broadcast season. The Sellers have granted Nexstar a call right and Nexstar has granted each of the Sellers a put right for such Seller s ownership interest beginning in August 2024 and June 2026, respectively. The acquisition solidifies Nexstar s revenue opportunities as the largest owner of The CW-affiliated stations, diversifies its content outside of news, improves its national advertising opportunities, establishes it as a participant in advertising video-on-demand services via The CW App and creates value by improving The CW s ratings, revenue, and profitability. As a result of the acquisition, Nexstar recognized a gain on bargain purchase of 55.6 million representing the excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired over the 0 purchase consideration and the fair value of noncontrolling interests. For additional information on this acquisition, see Note 3, Acquisitions and Dispositions to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

2022 Debt Transactions 
 On June 21, 2022, Nexstar amended its credit agreement (also herein referred to as senior secured credit facility) which provided for a 2.425 billion Nexstar Term Loan A, due June 2027, and a 550.0 million Nexstar revolving credit facility, due June 2027, of which no amount was drawn as of December 31, 2022. During 2022, Nexstar repaid a total of 2.902 billion of its debt, including refinancing of certain term loans of 2.414 billion funded by the new Nexstar Term Loan A, 417.2 million repayments of term loans funded by cash on hand, and repurchased and cancelled 71.2 million (at a weighted average purchase price of 94.2 of its senior unsecured notes. 

On June 21, 2022, Mission, an independently owned VIE consolidated by Nexstar, also amended its credit agreement (also herein referred to as senior secured credit facility) which provided for a 75.0 million Mission revolving credit facility, of which 61.5 million was drawn and the proceeds used to repay the outstanding Mission revolving loan of 61.5 million. 

Overview of Operations 
 As of December 31, 2022, we owned, operated, programmed or provided sales and other services to 199 full power television stations and one AM radio station, including those owned by VIEs, in 116 markets in 39 states and the District of Columbia. The stations are affiliates of ABC, NBC, FOX, CBS, The CW, MNTV and other broadcast television networks. Through various local service agreements, we provided sales, programming and other services to 36 full power television stations owned by independent third parties, of which 35 full power television stations are VIEs that are consolidated into our financial statements. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the local service agreements we have with these independent third parties. We also own NewsNation, a national cable news network, a recently acquired 75.0 ownership interest in The CW, the fifth major broadcast network in the U.S., two digital multicast networks, Antenna TV and Rewind TV, multicast network services provided to third parties, and a 31.3 ownership stake in TV Food Network. Our digital assets include more than 140 local websites, 280 mobile applications, 22 connected television applications, and six free-ad supported television channels representing products of our local television stations, The CW, NewsNation, The Hill, and BestReviews and a suite of advertising solutions. Together, our other digital properties attracted almost 100 million unique visitors in December 2022 according to Comscore. 
 The largest portion of operating revenue of our Company is derived from distribution revenue which relates to retransmission of Company stations signals and the carriage of our cable and broadcast networks by cable, satellite and other MVPDs and OVDs and, in the case of The CW, its local affiliates. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company s distribution revenue represented 49.3 of total net revenue. MVPDs generally pay for retransmission rights on a rate per subscriber basis. The growth of this revenue stream was primarily due to increases in the subscriber rates paid by MVPDs resulting from contract renewals (retransmission consent and carriage agreements generally have a three-year term), scheduled annual escalation of rates per subscriber, and the establishment of distribution agreements with OVDs, typically via our network affiliation partner and paid to us net of our affiliation fees. Nexstar anticipates that retransmission fees will continue to increase until there is a more balanced relationship between viewers delivered and fees paid for delivery of such viewers. 
 We also generate revenue from core television advertising and digital advertising revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company generated 33.0 of our net revenue from core advertising and 7.0 from digital advertising revenue. Core television and digital advertising is affected by a number of factors, including the economic conditions of the markets in which we operate, the demographic makeup of those markets, the marketing strategy we employ in each market and the health of the overall national advertising market. Most advertising contracts (other than national advertising contracts placed with our national networks at the beginning of the broadcast season) are short-term and generally run for a few weeks. Local advertising time is sold by each station s local sales staff via advertising agencies and directly to local businesses. National core television advertising revenue is derived from advertisements placed through advertising agencies. While the majority of local spot revenue is placed by local agencies, some advertisers place their schedules directly with the local sales force, thereby eliminating the agency commission. Our stations, cable and broadcast networks have various agreements with national representative firms which provide sales representation for national or large regional accounts that advertise in several markets simultaneously. National representative commission rates vary within the industry and are governed by each agreement. In addition, we generate digital advertising revenue from the sale of advertising on third party sites and other local and national services. 
 In even years, we generate a substantial amount of revenue from political advertising. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company generated 9.7 of our net revenue from political advertising. Political advertising is affected by the number of competitive races there are and the location of the Company s station in the relevant competitive markets, the amount of funds raised by candidates, PACs and others, the availability and pricing of television advertising inventory as well as the availability of alternative media. Because of the scale of Nexstar, we typically have a presence in the substantial majority of markets with competitive political races. All national revenue is derived from advertisements placed through advertising agencies pursuant to the agreements described above. 
 42 

Most of our stations have a network affiliation agreement pursuant to which the network provides programming to the station during specified time periods, including prime time, in exchange for affiliation fees paid to the networks, in most cases, and the right to sell a substantial majority of the advertising time during these broadcasts. Network affiliation fees have been increasing industry wide and we expect that they will continue to increase over the next several years. 
 Each station acquires licenses to broadcast programming in non-news and non-network time periods. The licenses are either purchased from a program distributor for cash and/or the program distributor is allowed to sell some of the advertising inventory as compensation to eliminate or reduce the cash cost for the license. The latter practice is referred to as barter broadcast rights. Our majority owned broadcast network, The CW, acquires licenses to broadcast programs from affiliates of Paramount Global and Warner Bros. Discovery, among others. 
 Our primary operating expenses include programming costs, newsgathering, employee salaries, and commissions and benefits. A large percentage of the costs involved in the operation of our stations and the stations we provide services to remains relatively fixed. 
 
 We (excluding The CW) guarantee full payment of all obligations incurred under Mission s senior secured credit facility in the event of its default. Mission is a guarantor of our senior secured credit facility, our 5.625 Notes, due July 2027 and our 4.75 Notes, due November 2028. In consideration of our guarantee of Mission s senior secured credit facility, Mission has granted us purchase options to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each Mission station, subject to FCC consent. These option agreements (which expire on various dates between 2023 and 2033) are freely exercisable or assignable by us without consent or approval by Mission or its shareholders. We expect these option agreements to be renewed upon expiration. 
 
 We do not own the consolidated VIEs or their television stations. However, we are deemed under U.S. GAAP to have controlling financial interests for financial reporting purposes in these entities because of (i) the local service agreements we have with their stations, (ii) our (excluding The CW) guarantee of the obligations incurred under Mission s senior secured credit facility, (iii) our power over significant activities affecting the VIEs economic performance, including budgeting for advertising revenue, advertising sales and, in some cases, hiring and firing of sales force personnel and (iv) purchase options granted by each consolidated VIE which permit us to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each of these VIEs stations, subject to FCC consent. In compliance with FCC regulations for all the parties, each of the consolidated VIEs maintains complete responsibility for and control over programming, finances and personnel for its stations. 
 Refer to Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information with respect to consolidated VIEs. 
 
 Regulatory Developments 
 As a television broadcaster, the Company is highly regulated, and its operations require that it retain or renew a variety of government approvals and comply with changing federal regulations. On April 1, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision that reversed a lower court of appeals ruling and upheld the FCC s elimination or modification of certain of its media ownership rules in the agency s 2010/2014 quadrennial review of those rules. Among the regulations eliminated in 2021 as a result of the Supreme Court ruling was a rule providing that a television station licensee which sells more than 15 percent of the weekly advertising inventory of another television station in the same market under a JSA is deemed to have an attributable ownership interest in that station, as well as a requirement that at least eight independently owned television stations remain in a local television market for a party to acquire a second station in that market. While these restrictions are no longer in effect, the FCC s 2018 quadrennial media ownership review is currently pending and the 2022 quadrennial review has also commenced. An FCC proceeding is also pending to review the current national limit on television station ownership. The FCC could reinstitute its earlier restrictions or impose other limitations in these or any future reviews. 
 The FCC has repurposed a portion of the broadcast television spectrum for wireless broadband use. In an incentive auction which concluded in April 2017, certain television broadcasters accepted bids from the FCC to voluntarily relinquish their spectrum in exchange for consideration. Television stations that did not relinquish their spectrum were repacked into the frequency band still remaining for television broadcast use. The Company has received payment for eleven television stations that accepted bids and either moved to different channels or (in one case) discontinued operations. Seventy-four (74) full power stations owned by Nexstar and 17 full power stations owned by VIEs were assigned to new channels in the reduced post-auction television band. These stations have commenced operation on their new assigned channels and have ceased operating on their former channels. The Company is in the final stages of obtaining reimbursements for the costs of repacking these stations.

Seasonality 
 
 Advertising revenue is positively affected by national and regional political election campaigns and certain events such as the Olympic Games or the Super Bowl. Advertising revenue is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to, and including, the holiday season. In addition, advertising revenue is generally higher during even-numbered years, when congressional and/or presidential elections occur and from advertising aired during the Olympic Games.

Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 
 The period-to-period comparability of our consolidated operating results is affected by acquisitions. For each quarter we present, our legacy business units include those business units that we owned or consolidated into our financial statements for the complete quarter in the current and prior years. For our annual and year to date presentations, we combine the legacy business unit amounts presented in each quarter. 
 Revenue 
 Core advertising revenue was 1,718.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 1,761.7 million for the same period in 2021, a decrease of 43.4 million, or 2.5 , primarily due to a weaker national advertising market, the absence of third quarter advertising revenue from the Olympics on our NBC affiliate stations and changes in the mix between our core and political advertising revenues of 70.1 million, partially offset by incremental revenue from our acquisition of The CW of 26.6 million. Key categories driving the decrease were direct response, insurance, gaming/sports betting, government services and radio/tv/cable/newspaper partially offset by increases in entertainment, home repair/manufacturing, drug stores/medication, travel, and attorneys. Automotive, our largest advertiser category, represented approximately 15.4 in 2022 and 15.5 in 2021 of our core advertising revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Overall, automotive advertising revenues decreased by approximately 0.8 in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to the shortage in supply of chips and semiconductors which impacted the availability of automobiles for sale and the need by automotive dealers to advertise. 
 Political advertising revenue was 505.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 45.2 million for the same period in 2021, an increase of 460.4 million, as 2022 was a mid-term election year. 
 Distribution revenue was 2,571.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2,472.9 million for the same period in 2021, an increase of 98.4 million, or 4.0 . The increase was primarily due to scheduled annual escalation of rates per subscriber, renewals of contracts in 2021 providing for higher rates per subscriber and incremental revenue from our acquisition of The CW of 17.2 million, partially offset by continued MVPD subscriber attrition, a few periods during the negotiation of new contracts with our MVPD partners where our partners stations were not available and a settlement of a dispute in connection with a new contract with one of our distributors. We anticipate continued increase of retransmission fees until there is a more balanced relationship between viewers delivered and fees paid for delivery of such viewers. 
 
 Digital revenue, representing advertising revenue on our stations web and mobile sites and other internet-based revenue, was 364.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 322.6 million for the same period in 2021, an increase of 42.0 million, or 13.0 , primarily due to growth in our television stations digital advertising and services revenue, incremental revenue from our acquisitions of The CW in September 2022 of 17.0 million and a digital business we acquired in the third quarter of 2021 of 22.1 million, offset by weakness in the national digital advertising market and ecommerce. 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Direct operating expenses, consisting primarily of news, engineering and programming, and selling, general and administrative expenses were 2,908.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2,710.8 million for the same period in 2021, an increase of 197.5 million, or 7.3 . This was primarily due to an increase in cost related to incremental operating expenses from our acquisitions of The CW in September 2022 of 70.2 million and a digital business we acquired in the third quarter of 2021 of 16.1 million, an increase in variable costs associated with the increase in net revenue, an increase in station programming costs due to network affiliation renewals and annual increases in network affiliation costs, increased promotion costs, partially offset by a reversal of an accrual in connection with a settlement of a dispute in connection with a new contract with one of our distributors and some administrative savings, primarily related to healthcare. 
 
 Corporate expenses, related to costs associated with the centralized management of our stations, were 198.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 175.8 million for the same period in 2021, an increase of 22.6 million, or 12.9 primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation of 14.9 million. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense were 662.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 588.6 million for the same period in 2021, an increase of 73.5 million, or 12.5 . Depreciation and amortization expense consists of the following: 
 Amortization of broadcast rights was 192.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 121.1 million for the same period in 2021, an increase of 71.8 million, or 59.3 . The increase was primarily due to incremental amortization from our acquisition of The CW of 89.8 million, partially offset by a reduction in NewsNation s costs of 9.4 million as it continues to shift its focus from syndicated programming to national news programs . 

45 

Amortization of intangible assets was 309.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 300.9 million for the same period in 2021, an increase of 8.4 million, or 2.8 (no significant change). 

Depreciation of property and equipment was 159.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 166.6 million for the same period in 2021, a decrease of 6.7 million, or 4.0 (no significant change). 

In the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded a 96.1 million goodwill and intangible assets impairment on our product review and recommendation platform reporting unit. The Company s assessment indicated that the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeded its fair value, and therefore an impairment loss was identified. 
 
 In 2022 and 2021, certain real estate properties located in Chicago were classified as held for sale. Due to designations as held for sale assets, the properties carrying amounts were written down to their estimated fair value, less estimated cost to sell resulting to the Company s recognition of impairment charges of 36.8 million and 23.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Gain on bargain purchase 
 
 Gain on bargain purchase of 55.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 pertains to our acquisition of The CW representing the excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired over the 0 purchase consideration and the fair value of noncontrolling interests. For additional information on this acquisition, see Note 3, Acquisitions and Dispositions to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Income from equity method investments, net 
 Income from equity method investments, net was 153.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 124.6 million for the same period in 2021, an increase of 28.8 million, primarily due to a decrease in the amortization of basis difference associated with our investment in TV Food Network of 55.7 million, partially offset by a lower equity in TV Food Network s net income of 26.7 million. For additional information on basis difference in our investment in TV Food Network, refer to Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Interest Expense, net 
 Interest expense, net was 336.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 282.7 million for the same period in 2021, an increase of 53.9 million, or 19.1 , primarily due to increases in interest rates in the Company s outstanding loans under its senior secured credit facilities, partially offset by decreases in interest expense from debt repayments and lower interest rates obtained in connection with the refinancing of certain of our term loans in June 2022. Interest rates on outstanding loans under the Company s senior secured credit facilities ranged from 5.86 to 6.89 as of December 31, 2022, compared to interest rates ranging from 1.60 to 2.60 as of December 31, 2021. These interest rates were a mixture of SOFR plus CSA, or credit spread adjustment used to account for the difference between SOFR and LIBOR, plus applicable margin and U.S. LIBOR plus applicable margin in 2022 compared to U.S. LIBOR plus applicable margin only in 2021. 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt was 2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 3.2 million for the same period in 2021, a decrease of 0.3 million (no significant change). 
 Pension and other postretirement plans credit, net 
 Pension and other postretirement plans credit, net was 43.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 80.9 million for the same period in 2021, a decrease of 37.8 million, primarily due to lower estimated expected return on plan assets of 18.6 million, higher estimated interest cost of 6.7 million and a 12.5 million settlement gain from the purchase of an annuity contract related to certain participants of a qualified pension plan during the fourth quarter of 2021. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 Income tax expense was 273.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to an income tax expense of 262.9 million for the same period in 2021, an increase of 10.7 million. The effective tax rates during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 22.5 and 24.1 , respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily related to changes in the valuation allowance resulted in an incremental income tax benefit of 23.8 million, or 2.1 decrease to the effective tax rate in 2022. The gain on bargain purchase arising from the acquisition of The CW resulted in a 1.1 decrease to the effective tax rate. 
 
 46 

Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020 
 The period-to-period comparability of our consolidated operating results is affected by acquisitions. For each quarter we present, our legacy business units include those business units that we owned or consolidated into our financial statements for the complete quarter in the current and prior years. For our annual and year to date presentations, we combine the legacy business unit amounts presented in each quarter. 
 Revenue 
 
 Core advertising revenue was 1,761.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 1,571.1 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of 190.6 million, or 12.1 . The increase was primarily due to an increase in our legacy stations core advertising revenue of 141.0 million, as a result of recovery from the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and growth in new business. The television stations acquired in 2020 also increased our advertising revenue by 61.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in advertising revenue from station divestitures of 12.3 million. Our largest advertiser category, automotive, represented approximately 16 and 18 of our core advertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Overall, including past results of our newly acquired stations, automotive revenues decreased by approximately 5 in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the current shortage in supply of chips and semiconductors, partially offset by the recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The other categories representing our top five largest categories by revenue increased in 2021, led by attorneys and followed by medical/healthcare, gaming/sports betting and services. While we are encouraged by the positive trends we saw during 2021, to the extent that the pandemic continues to have a negative impact on the U.S. economy, our results will be affected. 
 
 Political advertising revenue was 45.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 507.6 million for the same period in 2020, a decrease of 462.4 million, as 2021 was not a nationwide election year. 
 
 Distribution revenue was 2,472.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2,152.6 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of 320.3 million, or 14.9 . Our legacy stations revenue increased by 222.0 million primarily due to the combined effect of scheduled annual escalation of rates per subscriber and renewals of contracts providing for higher rates per subscriber. Additionally, our stations acquired in 2020 increased our revenue in 2021 by 113.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in revenue from our station divestitures of 15.3 million. We anticipate continued increase of retransmission fees until there is a more balanced relationship between viewers delivered and fees paid for delivery of such viewers. 
 Digital revenue, representing advertising revenue on our stations web and mobile sites and other internet-based revenue, was 322.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 223.4 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of 99.2 million, or 44.4 . This increase was primarily due to incremental revenue from the digital businesses and television stations we acquired in 2021 and 2020 of 70.3 million, and a net increase in revenue from our legacy stations and other digital businesses of 34.6 million. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 Direct operating expenses, consisting primarily of news, engineering, programming and selling, general and administrative expenses were 2,710.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2,449.6 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of 261.2 million, or 10.7 . This increase was primarily due to expenses associated with our television stations and digital businesses we acquired in 2021 and 2020 of 177.8 million, partially offset by station divestitures of 22.6 million. In addition, our legacy stations programming costs increased by 56.3 million, primarily due to network affiliation renewals and annual increases in our network affiliation costs. Our legacy stations and business units other operating expenses increased by 50.1 million, primarily due to recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase in sales and promotional costs to drive revenue and an increase in NewsNation s news related operating costs as it continues to shift its focus from syndicated programming to national newscast programs. 
 
 Corporate expenses, related to costs associated with the centralized management of our stations, were 175.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 183.0 million for the same period in 2020, a decrease of 7.2 million, or 3.9 . 

47 

Depreciation and amortization expense were 588.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 564.9 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of 23.7 million, or 4.2 . Depreciation and amortization expense consists of the following: 
 
 Amortization of broadcast rights was 121.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 137.5 million for the same period in 2020, a decrease of 16.4 million, or 11.9 . The decrease was primarily due to the reduction of NewsNation s costs by 17.5 million as it continues to shift its focus from syndicated programming to national news programs. 

Amortization of intangible assets was 300.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 279.7 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of 21.2 million, or 7.6 . This increase was primarily due to incremental amortization from business acquisitions. 

Depreciation of property and equipment was 166.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 147.7 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of 18.9 million, or 12.8 . The increase was primarily due to newly capitalized assets and incremental depreciation from business acquisitions. 

Certain of the Company s stations were repacked in connection with the FCC s process of repurposing a portion of the broadcast television spectrum for wireless broadband use. These stations have vacated their former channels and spent costs, mainly capital expenditures, to construct and license the necessary technical modifications to permanently operate on their newly assigned channels. Subject to fund limitations, the FCC reimburses television broadcasters, MVPDs and other parties for costs reasonably incurred due to the repack. In 2021 and 2020, the Company received 19.7 million and 57.3 million, respectively, in reimbursements from the FCC which it recognized as operating income. The Company is in the final stages of requesting and receiving reimbursements for the costs of repacking these stations, as the FCC is now closing out its process for such reimbursements. 
 
 In April 2020, we completed a station s conversion to a VHF channel representing our final relinquishment of spectrum pursuant to the FCC s incentive auction conducted in 2016-2017. Accordingly, the associated spectrum asset with a carrying amount of 67.2 million and liability to surrender spectrum of 78.0 million were derecognized, resulting in a non-cash gain on relinquishment of spectrum of 10.8 million. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2021, certain non-depreciable real estate property located in Chicago was classified as held for sale due to the expected consummation of a contract to sell within one year. As of December 31, 2021, the property s previous carrying amount of 68.3 million was written down to its estimated fair value, less estimated cost to sell, of 45.3 million resulting in a 23.0 million impairment charge. 
 
 Income from equity method investments, net 
 
 Income from equity method investments, net was 124.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 70.2 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of 54.4 million, primarily attributable to higher equity in TV Food Network s net income, net of the amortization of basis difference of 55.1 million. 
 Interest Expense, net 
 Interest expense, net was 282.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 335.3 million for the same period in 2020, a decrease of 52.6 million, or 15.7 . The decrease was primarily due to the combined effect of (i) a reduction in the outstanding balance of debt, (ii) reductions in LIBOR and (iii) a reduction in the Applicable Margin for the portion of certain interest rates that is based on the consolidated first lien net leverage ratio of the Company which was lower. 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt was 3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 50.7 million for the same period in 2020, a decrease of 47.5 million. In 2021, we made 280.0 million in prepayments on our term loan B resulting in recognition of loss of 3.2 million. In 2020, we redeemed our 900.0 million 5.625 Notes due 2024 and prepaid 1.0 billion of our outstanding term loans. These transactions resulted in a premium paid on bond redemption of 25.3 million and a write-off of unamortized debt discount/premiums and debt financing costs of 25.7 million associated with these extinguished debt obligations. 
 
 48 

Pension and other postretirement plans credit, net 
 Pension and other postretirement plans credit, net was 80.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 46.0 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of 34.9 million, primarily attributable to an increase in expected return on pension plan assets and an estimated reduction in interest costs on projected benefit obligations, and a 12.5 million settlement gain from the purchase of an annuity contract related to certain participants of a qualified pension plan during the fourth quarter of 2021. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 Income tax expense was 262.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to an income tax expense of 296.5 million for the same period in 2020, a decrease of 33.6 million. The effective tax rates during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were 24.1 and 26.9 , respectively. The decrease in the effective rate was driven by an increased deduction for excess benefits related to stock-based compensation, a decrease in non-deductible goodwill on divestitures, and a release of certain federal and state reserves. The increase in excess benefits deduction resulted in a 19.6 million tax benefit or a decrease of 1.8 to the effective rate. The decrease in non-deductible goodwill resulted in a tax benefit of 8.3 million or a decrease of 0.8 to the effective tax rate. Additionally, the release of 13.3 million of certain federal and state reserves resulted in a 1.2 reduction to the effective rate. These decreases to the effective tax rate were offset by an increase in the valuation allowance of 18.9 million resulting in a 1.3 increase to the effective rate. 

49 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company is leveraged, which makes it vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions. The Company s ability to repay or refinance its debt will depend on, among other things, financial, business, market, competitive and other conditions, many of which are beyond the Company s control. The Company believes it has sufficient unrestricted cash on hand, positive working capital, and availability to access additional cash under its revolving credit facilities (with a maturity date of June 2027) to meet its business operating requirements, its capital expenditures and to continue to service its debt for at least the next 12 months as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the amended credit agreements governing its senior secured credit facilities. 
 Any future adverse economic conditions, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, heightened and sustained inflation and higher interest rates, could adversely affect the Company s future operating results, cash flows and financial condition.

Cash Flows Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 188.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. This was primarily due to an increase in operating income (excluding non-cash transactions) of 356.9 million, sources of cash resulting from timing of accounts receivable collections of 108.2 million, and an increase in distributions from our equity investment in TV Food Network of 10.1 million. These increases were partially offset by an increase in payments for broadcast rights of 76.9 million, use of cash from timing of payments to our vendors of 107.0 million, higher interest payments of 56.9 million, and higher tax payments of 50.0 million and other items. The increase in payments for broadcast rights was due to incremental payments from our acquisition of The CW of 118.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in payments for our syndicated programming of 41.6 million. 
 Cash paid for interest increased primarily due to increases in the effective interest rates in the Company s outstanding floating rate loans under its senior secured credit facilities due to the increase in SOFR and LIBOR, partially offset by decreases in interest expense from debt repayments and lower interest rates obtained in connection with the refinancing of certain of our term loans in June 2022. The increase in tax payments was primarily due to the sale of certain real estate properties in 2022 resulting in tax payments of 48.0 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 39.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. This was primarily due to a decrease in operating income (excluding non-cash transactions) of 136.3 million and uses of cash resulting from timing of accounts receivable collections of 102.5 million. These decreases were partially offset by lower interest payments of 51.1 million, timing of payments to our vendors of 46.8 million, collection of copyright royalty receivables of 35.0 million, lower payments for broadcast rights of 26.2 million, lower tax payments of 31.9 million and an increase in distributions from our equity investment in TV Food Network of 15.8 million. 
 Cash paid for interest decreased by 51.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to a reduction in outstanding principal debt balance due to prepayments and scheduled repayments of term loans and reductions in LIBOR and a portion of certain interest rates that is based on the Company s consolidated first lien net leverage ratio. 
 
 Cash Flows Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 was 125.2 million. Net cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was 232.1 million and 39.8 million, respectively. 
 In 2022, the Company received proceeds from the sale of certain real estate properties of 241.8 million, received a deposit associated with a proposed sale of real estate property of 10.0 million and recorded cash acquired from The CW acquisition of 28.9 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of 157.3 million. 
 In 2021, we spent a total of 150.7 million in capital expenditures and 138.4 million to acquire television stations, a digital business and certain license assets. These decreases were partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of stations and business units and asset disposals of 20.1 million, reimbursements from the FCC related to station repack of 19.7 million and deposits received associated with the sale of real estate assets of 13.5 million. 
 In 2020, we acquired seven television stations, certain non-license assets, and a product recommendations company for total cash consideration payments of 386.4 million. Our capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 were 217.0 million, including 54.7 million related to station repack. These uses of cash were partially offset by the proceeds from the disposal of two television stations and our sports betting information website business for 349.9 million and 12.9 million in cash, respectively, and reimbursements received from the FCC related to station repack of 57.3 million. We also received 98.0 million of cash proceeds from the settlement of litigation between Sinclair and Tribune and Mission collected a loan receivable of 49.0 million from Marshall Broadcasting Group, Inc. 
 
 Cash Flows Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was 1,515.0 million, 945.5 million and 1,293.8 million, respectively. 
 In 2022, we received 2,420.2 million (net of 4.8 million discount) from our new Term Loan A, due June 2027 and utilized 2,414.3 million to repay outstanding principal balances of our Term Loan A, due October 2023, Term Loan A, due September 2024, Term Loan B, due January 2024 and a portion of Term Loan B, due September 2026. Nexstar prepaid an additional 333.0 million in principal balance under its Term Loan B, repaid scheduled principal maturities of 84.2 million of its term loans, and repurchased and cancelled 71.2 million of its senior unsecured notes all funded by cash on hand. We paid dividends to our common stockholders of 142.2 million 0.90 per share per quarter), repurchased 5.1 million shares of our common stock for total payments of 880.7 million, paid for software obligations of 16.3 million, paid contingent consideration in connection with a past acquisition of 13.9 million, and paid cash for taxes in exchange for shares of common stock withheld of 12.6 million resulting from net share settlements of certain stock-based compensation. These decreases were partially offset by contribution from noncontrolling interests of 30.4 million. Mission also borrowed 61.5 million in a revolving loan, due June 2027 and utilized the proceeds to repay all of its outstanding borrowings under its revolving loan, due October 2023 of 61.5 million. 
 
 51 

In 2021, we prepaid a portion of the outstanding principal balance of our Term Loan B, due January 2024 of 280.0 million and made scheduled principal payments on our Term Loan A, due September 2024 of 21.4 million, paid dividends to our common stockholders of 118.2 million 0.70 per share during each quarter), repurchased common shares of 536.8 million, paid cash for taxes in exchange for shares of common stock withheld of 10.9 million resulting from net share settlements of certain stock-based compensation, and paid finance lease and software obligations of 18.0 million. These outflows were partially offset by the proceeds from the exercise of stock options during the year amounting to 8.2 million. Mission also received 298.5 million (net of 1.5 million discount) from its new Term Loan B, due June 2028 and utilized 268.0 million to repay a portion of its revolving loans. We also borrowed 20.0 million under our revolving credit facilities which was repaid in full in 2021. 
 
 In 2020, the Company made payments on the outstanding principal balance of its term loans of 1.284 billion (including 980.0 million in Nexstar debt prepayments, Mission s full repayment of its term loan B of 226.2 million and Shield Media, LLC s full repayment of its term loan A of 20.7 million). Also, we redeemed our 900.0 million 5.625 Notes due 2024 and paid a 25.1 million premium on such redemption. Additionally, we repurchased shares of our common stock for a total price of 281.9 million, paid dividends to our common stockholders of 101.0 million 0.56 per share during each quarter), paid deferred financing costs of 10.7 million associated with our new 1.0 billion 4.75 Notes, due November 2028, paid cash for taxes in exchange for shares of common stock withheld of 6.8 million resulting from net share settlements of certain stock-based compensation and paid finance lease and software obligations of 14.5 million. These decreases were offset by the proceeds from the issuance of our new 1.0 billion senior unsecured notes issued at par and from Mission s drawing from its revolving credit facility of 327.0 million. 
 Subsequent Investing and Financing Activities 
 From January 1, 2023 to February 27, 2023, we repurchased 171,208 shares of our common stock for 32.9 million, funded by cash on hand. As of the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the total remaining available amount under the existing and new share repurchase authorizations was 1.225 billion. 
 On January 26, 2023, our board of directors approved a 50 increase in the quarterly cash dividend to 1.35 per share of our common stock beginning with the dividend declared for the first quarter of 2023. The dividend was paid on February 24, 2023 to stockholders of record on February 10, 2023. 
 Our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our existing notes may limit the amount of dividends we may pay to stockholders and share repurchases we may make over the term of the agreement. 
 
 Long-term debt 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had total outstanding debt of 6.952 billion, net of unamortized financing costs, discounts and premium, which represented 71.7 of the Company s combined capitalization. The Company s high level of debt requires that a substantial portion of cash flow be dedicated to pay principal and interest on debt, which reduces the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.

______________________________________________ 
 (1) Based on the covenant calculations as of December 31, 2022, all of the 529.1 million (net of outstanding standby letters of credit of 20.9 million) and 13.5 million unused revolving loan commitments under the respective Nexstar and Mission senior secured credit facilities were available for borrowing. 

We (excluding The CW) guarantee full payment of all obligations incurred under Mission s senior secured credit facility in the event of its default. Mission is a guarantor of our senior secured credit facility, our 5.625 Notes, due July 2027 and our 4.75 Notes, due November 2028. 

52 

We make semiannual interest payments on the 5.625 Notes, due July 2027 on January 15 and July 15 of each year. We make semiannual interest payments on our 4.75 Notes, due November 2028 on May 1 and November 1 of each year. Interest payments on our and Mission s senior secured credit facilities are generally paid every one to three months and are payable based on the type of interest rate selected. 
 The terms of our and Mission s senior secured credit facilities, as well as the indentures governing our 5.625 Notes, due July 2027 and 4.75 Notes, due November 2028, limit, but do not prohibit us or Mission, from incurring substantial amounts of additional debt in the future. 
 The Company does not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of its debt. However, a downgrade in the Company s credit rating could adversely affect its ability to renew the existing credit facilities, obtain access to new credit facilities or otherwise issue debt in the future and could increase the cost of such debt. 
 The Company s ability to access funds under its senior secured credit facilities depends, in part, on its compliance with certain financial covenants. Any additional drawings under the senior secured credit facilities will reduce the Company s future borrowing capacity and the amount of total unused revolving loan commitments. Any adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or any future adverse economic conditions, including those resulting from heightened and sustained inflation and higher interest rates could adversely affect our future operating results and cash flows and may cause us to seek alternative sources of funding, including accessing capital markets, subject to market conditions. Such alternative sources of funding may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 
 
 Our credit agreement contains a covenant which requires us to comply with a maximum consolidated first lien net leverage ratio of 4.25 to 1.00. The financial covenant, which is formally calculated on a quarterly basis, is based on the Company s combined results. The Mission amended credit agreement does not contain financial covenant ratio requirements but does provide for default in the event we do not comply with all covenants contained in our credit agreement. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with our financial covenant. We believe the Company will be able to maintain compliance with all covenants contained in the credit agreements governing its senior secured facilities and the indentures governing Nexstar s 5.625 Notes, due July 2027 and Nexstar s 4.75 Notes, due November 2028 for a period of at least the next 12 months from December 31, 2022. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or VIEs, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. All of our arrangements with our VIEs in which we are the primary beneficiary are on-balance sheet arrangements. Our variable interests in other entities are obtained through local service agreements, which have valid business purposes and transfer certain station activities from the station owners to us. We are, therefore, not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we have outstanding standby letters of credit with various financial institutions amounting to 20.2 million, of which 16.7 million was in support of the worker s compensation insurance program. The outstanding balance of standby letters of credit is deducted against our unused revolving loan commitment under our senior secured credit facility and would not be available for withdrawal.

(1) Future minimum payments for license agreements for which the license period has begun and liabilities have been recorded. 

(2) As of December 31, 2022, we had 29.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits, inclusive of interest and certain deduction benefits. This liability represents an estimate of tax positions that the Company has taken in its tax returns, which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. The resolution of these tax positions may not require cash settlement due to the existence of federal and state NOLs. As such, our contractual obligations table above excludes this liability. 

(3) As of December 31, 2022, we had 216.8 million and 21.3 million of funding obligations with respect to our pension benefit plans and other postretirement benefit plans, respectively, which are not included in the table above. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our funding obligations for these benefit plans.

(5) Includes the employment contracts for all corporate executive employees and general managers of our stations and entities. We expect our contracts will be renewed or replaced with similar agreements upon their expiration. Amounts included in the table above assume that contracts are not terminated prior to their expiration.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to business acquisitions, goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, equity investments, distribution revenue, pension and postretirement benefit plans and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates. 
 For an overview of our significant accounting policies, we refer you to Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe the following critical accounting policies are those that are the most important to the presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, affect our more significant estimates and assumptions, and require the most subjective or complex judgments by management. 
 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities 
 We regularly evaluate our local service agreements and other arrangements where we may have variable interests to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Under U.S. GAAP, a company must consolidate an entity when it has a controlling financial interest resulting from ownership of a majority of the entity s voting rights. Accounting rules expanded the definition of controlling financial interest to include factors other than equity ownership and voting rights. 
 In applying accounting and disclosure requirements, we must base our decision to consolidate an entity on quantitative and qualitative factors that indicate whether or not we have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly affect its economic performance and whether or not we have the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Our evaluation of the power and economics model must be an ongoing process and may alter as facts and circumstances change. 
 Mission and the other consolidated VIEs are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements because we are deemed to have controlling financial interests in these entities as VIEs for financial reporting purposes as a result of (i) local service agreements we have with the stations they own, (ii) Nexstar s (excluding The CW) guarantee of the obligations incurred under Mission s senior secured credit facility, (iii) our power over significant activities affecting these entities economic performance, including budgeting for advertising revenue, advertising sales and, in some cases, hiring and firing of sales force personnel and (iv) purchase options granted by each consolidated VIE which permit Nexstar to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of all of these VIEs stations at any time, subject to FCC consent. These purchase options are freely exercisable or assignable by Nexstar without consent or approval by the VIEs. These option agreements expire on various dates between 2023 and 2033. We expect to renew these option agreements upon expiration. Therefore, these VIEs are consolidated into these financial statements. 
 
 Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
 Intangible assets represented 8.305 billion, or 65.5 , of our total assets as of December 31, 2022. Intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets (such as FCC licenses), and definite-lived intangible assets (such as network affiliation agreements). 
 The purchase prices of acquired businesses are allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired at estimated fair values at the date of acquisition using various valuation techniques, including discounted projected cash flows, the replacement cost approach and other income, market or cost approaches. 
 The estimated fair value of an FCC license acquired in a business combination is calculated using a discounted projected cash flow model referred to as the Greenfield Method. The Greenfield Method attempts to isolate the income that is attributable to the license alone. This approach is based upon modeling a hypothetical start-up station and building it up to a normalized operation that, by design, lacks an affiliation with a network (commonly known as an independent station), lacks inherent goodwill and whose other assets have essentially been added as part of the build-up process. The Greenfield Method assumes annual cash flows over a projection period model. Inputs to this model include, but are not limited to, (i) a four-year build-up period for a start-up station to reach a normalized state of operations, (ii) television market long-term revenue growth rate over a projection period, (iii) estimated market revenue share for a typical market participant without a network affiliation, (iv) estimated profit margins based on industry data, (v) capital expenditures based on the size of market and the type of station being constructed, (vi) estimated tax rates in the appropriate jurisdiction, and (vii) an estimated discount rate using a weighted average cost of capital analysis. The Greenfield Method also includes an estimated terminal value by discounting an estimated annual cash flow with an estimated long-term growth rate. 
 
 56 

The assumptions used in estimating the fair value of a network affiliation agreement acquired in a business combination are similar to those used in the valuation of an FCC license. The Greenfield Method is also utilized in the valuation of network affiliation agreements except that the estimated market revenue share, estimated profit margins, capital expenditures and other assumptions reflect a market participant premium based on the programming of a network affiliate relative to an independent station. This approach would result in an estimated collective fair value of the FCC license and a network affiliation agreement. The excess of the estimated fair value in this model over the estimated value of an FCC license of an independent station under the Greenfield Method represents the estimated fair value of a network affiliation agreement. 
 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of a business over the fair value of the net assets acquired. 
 For purposes of goodwill impairment tests, the Company has one aggregated television stations reporting unit, because of the stations similar economic characteristics, one cable network reporting unit and two digital business reporting units. The Company s impairment review for FCC licenses is performed at the television station market level. 
 We test our goodwill and FCC licenses in our fourth quarter each year, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired. We first assess the qualitative factors to determine the likelihood of our goodwill and FCC licenses being impaired. Our qualitative impairment test includes, but is not limited to, assessing the changes in macroeconomic conditions, regulatory environment, industry and market conditions, and the financial performance versus budget of the reporting units, as well as any other events or circumstances specific to the reporting unit or the FCC licenses. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an FCC license is greater than its respective carrying amount, no further testing will be required. Otherwise, we will apply the quantitative impairment test method. 
 The quantitative impairment test for goodwill is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The quantitative impairment test for FCC licenses consists of a market-by-market comparison of the carrying amounts of FCC licenses with their fair values, using the Greenfield Method of discounted cash flow analysis. An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an FCC license exceeds its fair value. 
 We test our definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable, relying on certain factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections and anticipated future cash flows. The carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the projected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the asset or asset group over its remaining life, or primary asset s life, plus proceeds received from its eventual disposition are less than its carrying value. The Company measures impairment based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the long-lived asset or asset group. The fair value is determined primarily by using the projected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved as well as market valuations. 
 
 In the fourth quarter of 2022, using the qualitative impairment test, the Company performed its annual impairment assessment on goodwill attributable to its aggregated television stations reporting unit and cable network reporting unit. Based on the results of such qualitative impairment tests, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that each reporting unit s fair value would sufficiently exceed the related carrying amount. The Company also performed its annual impairment assessment on FCC licenses for each television station market using the qualitative impairment test and concluded that it was more likely than not that their fair values exceeded the respective carrying amounts. Thus, no impairment was recorded on the associated goodwill and FCC licenses. 
 
 With respect to the Company s digital reporting units, the Company elected to perform quantitative impairment tests due to uncertain economic conditions in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Company s assessment indicated that the fair value of one digital reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount by over 19 , and therefore no goodwill impairment was identified. Goodwill associated with this reporting unit was 69.1 million as of December 31, 2022. 

57 

In the second digital reporting unit, which was tested for impairment, quantitatively, in the fourth quarter of 2021 with an identified fair value exceeding the carrying value of the reporting unit by approximately 10 , the Company identified a partial goodwill impairment of 90.8 million. The impairment was identified in the fourth quarter of 2022 given the operating performance of the reporting unit, the seasonality of the business and changes in the outlook of the business. The fair value was estimated using a combination of an income approach, which employs a discounted cash flow model, and market approaches. The significant assumptions used in estimating fair value included: (i) compound annual growth rates for revenues ranging from 6.1 to 8.1 , (ii) operating profit margins ranging from 8.3 to 15.0 , (iii) an income tax rate of 26.0 based on statutory federal and blended state tax rates, (iv) a discount rate of 14.5 based on an analysis of e-commerce companies, (v) a terminal growth rate of 1.5 based on a mature company in the e-commerce industry, and (vi) market net revenue and earnings multiples of comparable publicly traded businesses. As of December 31, 2022, this second digital reporting unit has an immaterial remaining goodwill balance. 
 
 We also performed qualitative tests to determine whether our definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets are recoverable. Based on our estimate of undiscounted future pre-tax cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of these assets, we determined that the carrying amounts are recoverable except for an immaterial impairment on definite-lived intangible assets of one digital reporting unit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022. No other events or circumstances were noted in 2022 that would indicate impairment. 
 Our quantitative goodwill impairment tests are sensitive to changes in key assumptions used in our analysis, such as expected future cash flows and market trends. If the assumptions used in our analysis are not realized, it is possible that an additional impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. 
 
 Valuation of Investments 
 We account for investments in which we own at least 20 of an investee s voting securities or we have significant influence over an investee under the equity method of accounting. We record equity method investments at cost. For investments acquired in a business combination, the cost is the estimated fair value allocated to the investment. 
 We evaluate our equity method investments for other-than temporary impairment OTTI on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. In each of the quarters of 2022, the Company evaluated its equity method investments for OTTI and determined that an impairment did not exist. The Company will continue to evaluate its equity method investments for OTTI in future periods. 
 Pension plans and other postretirement benefits 
 A determination of the liabilities and cost of Nexstar s pension and other postretirement plans OPEB requires the use of assumptions. The actuarial assumptions used in the pension and postretirement reporting are reviewed annually with independent actuaries and are compared with external benchmarks, historical trends and Nexstar s own experience to determine that its assumptions are reasonable. The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: 
 discount rates 

expected return on plan assets 

mortality rates 

retirement rates 

expected contributions 

As of December 31, 2022, the effective discount rates used for determining pension benefit obligations were 4.98 to 4.99 . During 2022, the assumptions utilized in determining net periodic benefit credit on our pension plans were (i) 4.01 to 5.01 expected rate of return on plan assets and (ii) 2.69 to 2.70 effective discount rates. As of December 31, 2022, our pension plans benefit obligations were 1.779 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our pension plans net periodic benefit credit was 37.6 million. As of December 31, 2022, a 1 change in the discount rates would have the following effects (in millions): 

1 Increase

 Distribution Revenue 
 We earn revenues from MVPDs and OVDs for the retransmission of our broadcasts and the carriage of NewsNation. These revenues are generally earned based on a price per subscriber of the distributor within the retransmission or carriage area. The distributors report their subscriber numbers to us generally on a 30- to 60-day lag, generally upon payment of the fees due to us. Prior to receiving the reports, we record revenue based on management s estimate of the number of subscribers, utilizing historical levels and trends of subscribers for each distributor. Adjustments associated with the resolution of such estimates have, historically, been inconsequential. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is applied against net deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such a determination was made. 
 
 We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities. The determination is based on the technical merits of the position and presumes that each uncertain tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The estimate of the Company s tax liabilities relating to uncertain tax positions requires management to assess uncertainties and to make judgements about the application of complex tax laws and regulations. We recognize interest and penalties relating to income taxes as components of income tax expense. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Refer to Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, including our expected date of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial position. 
 Item 7A.	Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt obligations. 
 The term loan borrowings under the Company s senior credit facilities bear interest at rates ranging from 5.86 to 6.89 as of December 31, 2022, which represent (i) the base rate, the SOFR or the US LIBOR plus (ii) a credit spread adjustment in the case of SOFR-based loans, and (iii) the applicable margin, as defined. Interest is payable in accordance with the credit agreements. 
 Based on the outstanding balances of the Company s senior secured credit facilities (term loans and revolving loans) as of December 31, 2022, an increase in each of SOFR and US LIBOR by 100 basis points would increase our annual interest expense and decrease our cash flow from operations by 42.8 million (excluding tax effects). A decrease in each of SOFR and US LIBOR by 100 basis points would decrease our annual interest expense and increase our cash flow from operations by 42.8 million (excluding tax effects). Our 5.625 Notes due July 2027 and 4.75 Notes due November 2028 are fixed rate debt obligations and therefore are not exposed to market interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has no financial instruments in place to hedge against changes in the benchmark interest rates on its senior secured credit facilities.

 Based upon that evaluation, Nexstar s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of December 31, 2022, Nexstar s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to Nexstar s management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 During the quarterly period as of the end of the period covered by this report, there have been no changes in Nexstar s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Nexstar s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based upon the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) . 
 As of December 31, 2022, we have excluded from the scope of our assessment of internal control over financial reporting The CW which we acquired on September 30, 2022 in a purchase business combination. As of December 31, 2022 and for the period from September 30, 2022 through December 31, 2022, the total assets and total net revenues of The CW that are excluded from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting represent approximately 2.3 and 1.2 , respectively, of the related consolidated total assets and consolidated net revenues of Nexstar as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Based on management s assessment, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 as stated in their report which appears herein.

Report of Independent Regist ered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Nexstar Media Group, Inc. 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Nexstar Media Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, of changes in stockholders equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
 As described in Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded The CW Network, LLC from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2022. We have also excluded The CW Network, LLC from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. The CW Network, LLC is a consolidated subsidiary whose total assets and total net revenues excluded from management s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent 2.3 and 1.2 , respectively, of total assets and total net revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 F- 2 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Uncertain Tax Position Related to the Chicago Cubs Transactions 
 
 As described in Notes 14 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions of 28.0 million as of December 31, 2022. As disclosed by management, the estimate of the Company s tax liabilities relating to uncertain tax positions requires management to assess uncertainties and to make judgments about the application of complex tax laws and regulations. On June 28, 2016, the Internal Revenue Service IRS issued Tribune Media Company (a subsidiary of the Company, Tribune a Notice of Deficiency which presented the IRS s position that a gain with respect to a contribution of certain assets and liabilities related to the businesses of the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball franchise the Chicago Cubs Transactions should have been included in Tribune s 2009 taxable income. Accordingly, the IRS proposed a 182.0 million tax and a 73.0 million gross valuation misstatement penalty. After-tax interest on the aforementioned proposed tax and penalty through December 31, 2022 would be approximately 158.0 million. During the third quarter of 2016, Tribune filed a petition in U.S. Tax Court to contest the IRS s determination. On October 26, 2021, the Tax Court issued an opinion related to the Chicago Cubs Transactions, which held that Tribune s structure was, in substantial part, in compliance with partnership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code IRC and, as a result, did not trigger the entire 2009 taxable gain proposed by the IRS. As of December 31, 2022, management believes the tax impact of applying the Tax Court opinion is not material to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the uncertain tax position related to the Chicago Cubs Transactions is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when assessing the measurement of the uncertain tax position related to the Chicago Cubs Transactions; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence related to the measurement of the uncertain tax position related to the Chicago Cubs Transactions; (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls related to measurement of the uncertain tax position related to the Chicago Cubs Transactions. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing the information used in the calculation of the liability for the uncertain tax position related to the Chicago Cubs Transactions, including federal filing positions and the related final tax returns; (ii) testing the calculation of the liability for the uncertain tax position related to the Chicago Cubs Transactions, including management s assessment of the technical merits of the tax position; (iii) testing management s assessment of the possible outcomes of the uncertain tax position related to the Chicago Cubs Transactions; and (iv) evaluating the status and results of income tax audits with the relevant tax authorities. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the measurement of the uncertain tax position related to the Chicago Cubs Transactions, including evaluating the reasonableness of management s assessment of the amount of potential tax benefit to be realized, and the application of relevant tax laws.

 full power television stations and AM radio station, including those television stations owned by VIEs, in markets in states and the District of Columbia. The stations are affiliates of CBS, FOX, NBC, ABC, The CW, MyNetworkTV, and other broadcast television networks. As of December 31, 2022 , the stations reached approximately of all U.S. television households (after applying the Federal Communications Commission s FCC ultra-high frequency UHF discount). Through various local service agreements, we provided sales, programming, and other services to television stations owned by consolidated VIEs and television station owned by an unconsolidated VIE. Nexstar also owns a ownership in The CW Network, LLC, the fifth major broadcast network in the U.S. The CW (see Note 3), NewsNation, a national cable news network, digital multicast networks, Antenna TV and Rewind TV, and multicast network services provided to third parties, and a ownership stake in Television Food Network, G.P. TV Food Network ). Our digital assets include more than local websites, mobile applications, connected television applications, and free-ad supported television channels representing products of our local television stations, The CW, NewsNationNow, The Hill and BestReviews and a suite of advertising solutions. 

Consolidated VIEs Nexstar consolidates entities in which it is deemed under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP to have controlling financial interests for financial reporting purposes as a result of (i) local service agreements Nexstar has with the stations owned by these entities, (ii) Nexstar s (excluding The CW) guarantee of the obligations incurred under Mission Broadcasting, Inc. s Mission senior secured credit facility (see Note 8), (iii) Nexstar having power over significant activities affecting these VIEs economic performance, including budgeting for advertising revenue, certain advertising sales and hiring and firing of sales force personnel and (iv) purchase options granted by each consolidated VIE which permit Nexstar to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each of these VIEs stations, subject to FCC consent.

Non-Consolidated VIEs Nexstar has an outsourcing agreement with Cunningham Broadcasting Corporation Cunningham ), which continues through December 31, 2023. Under the outsourcing agreement, Nexstar provides certain engineering, production, sales and administrative services for WYZZ, the FOX affiliate in the Peoria, Illinois market, through WMBD, the Nexstar television station in that market. During the term of the outsourcing agreement, Nexstar retains the broadcasting revenue and related expenses of WYZZ and is obligated to pay a monthly fee to Cunningham based on the combined operating cash flow of WMBD and WYZZ, as defined in the agreement. Nexstar has determined that it has a variable interest in WYZZ. Nexstar has also evaluated its arrangements with Cunningham and has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the variable interest in this station because it does not have the ultimate power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the station s economic performance, including developing the annual operating budget, programming and oversight and control of sales management personnel. Therefore, Nexstar has not consolidated WYZZ under authoritative guidance related to the consolidation of VIEs. There were no significant transactions arising from Nexstar s outsourcing agreement with Cunningham. Cunningham does not guarantee Nexstar s debt. 

Digital Revenues For station digital advertising, the performance obligation is a station s promise to place an advertisement on its website and is satisfied either based on impressions or the placement of ads over an agreed period of time. Advertising revenue is recognized, for the amount the Company is entitled to receive, when the advertisements are broadcast or delivered on the stations websites. Other digital advertising includes revenue from video and display advertising platforms that are delivered locally or nationally through our own and various third party websites and mobile applications. Revenue is recognized at the time advertising is delivered through these platforms. Revenue from other digital businesses includes a consumer product reviews platform, which is recognized upon performance of services. The Company applies the right to invoice practical expedient to certain transactions where the invoice amount corresponds directly with the value to its customers. Most of the arrangements with customers are short-term in nature. Contract Costs The Company does not capitalize costs incurred to obtain contracts for advertising due to their short-term nature. Additionally, the incremental benefit from efforts in acquiring these contracts is not considered significant. Thus, the Company records sales commissions as an expense when incurred. Contract Liabilities The Company s contract liabilities, which are included in its Consolidated Financial Statements as other current liabilities, consist primarily of customer payments received for products or services before the transfer of control to the customer occurs (deferred revenue). The performance primarily involves the delivery of advertisements to the customers. The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations on its contracts with customers because they are either (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less, (ii) contracts for which the sales- or usage-based royalty exception was applied, or (iii) contracts for which revenue is recognized in proportion to the amount the Company has the right to invoice for services performed. See Note 17 for disaggregated revenue information. 
 million. The asset was classified as held for sale in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021 . On October 19, 2022, a real estate property located in Chicago was reclassified as held for sale due to the buyer s exercise of its option to purchase. Upon designation as an asset held for sale, it was written down to its estimated fair value, less estimated cost to sell, of million, resulting in a million impairment charge. The sale closed on November 18, 2022. 
 of an investee s voting securities or has significant influence over an investee under the equity method of accounting. The Company records equity method investments at cost. For investments acquired in a business combination, the cost is the estimated fair value allocated to the investment. The amounts initially recognized are subsequently adjusted for the Company s appropriate share of the net earnings or losses of the investee. The Company records any investee losses up to the carrying amount of the investment plus any advances and loans made to the investee and any financial guarantees made on behalf of the investee. The Company recognizes its share in earnings and losses of the investee as Income from equity method investments, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Investments are also increased by contributions made to and decreased by distributions from the investee. The Company evaluates equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may be impaired. The Company evaluates equity method investments for other-than temporary impairment OTTI on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company did t identify any impairments on its investments. See Note 8 for additional information. 
 
 million of costs that was contractually due related to episodes that had been completed by certain production companies but not yet delivered to the Company. Such episodes are typically delivered within a few weeks of completion. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, amortization of broadcast rights of million, million and million, respectively, were included in Depreciation and amortization expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. 
 
 The estimated fair value of an FCC license acquired in a business combination is calculated using a discounted projected cash flow model referred to as the Greenfield Method. The Greenfield Method attempts to isolate the income that is attributable to the license alone. This approach is based upon modeling a hypothetical start-up station and building it up to a normalized operation that, by design, lacks an affiliation with a network (commonly known as an independent station), lacks inherent goodwill and whose other assets have essentially been added as part of the build-up process. The Greenfield Method assumes annual cash flows over a projection period model. Inputs to this model include, but are not limited to, (i) a four-year build-up period for a start-up station to reach a normalized state of operations, (ii) television market long-term growth rate over a projection period, (iii) estimated market revenue share for a typical market participant without a network affiliation, (iv) estimated profit margins based on industry data, (v) capital expenditures based on the size of market and the type of station being constructed, (vi) estimated tax rates in the appropriate jurisdiction, and (vii) an estimated discount rate using a weighted average cost of capital analysis. The Greenfield Method also includes an estimated terminal value by discounting an estimated annual cash flow with an estimated long-term growth rate. The assumptions used in estimating the fair value of a network affiliation agreement acquired in a business combination are similar to those used in the valuation of an FCC license. The Greenfield Method is also utilized in the valuation of network affiliation agreements except that the estimated market revenue share, estimated profit margins, capital expenditures and other assumptions reflect a market participant premium based on the programming of a network affiliate relative to an independent station. This approach would result in an estimated collective fair value of the FCC license and a network affiliation agreement. The excess of the estimated fair value in this model over the estimated value of an FCC license of an independent station under the Greenfield Method represents the estimated fair value of a network affiliation agreement. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date of a business, the Company records adjustments related to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recognized in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The Company s goodwill and FCC licenses are considered to be indefinite-lived intangible assets and are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually in the Company s fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired. The use of an indefinite life for FCC licenses contemplates the Company s historical ability to renew its licenses such that renewals generally may be obtained indefinitely and at little cost. Therefore, cash flows derived from the FCC licenses are expected to continue indefinitely. Network affiliation agreements are subject to amortization computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of years. The 15-year life assumes affiliation contracts will be renewed upon expiration. Changes in the likelihood of renewal could require a change in the useful life of such assets and cause an acceleration of amortization. The Company evaluates the remaining lives of its network affiliations whenever changes occur in the likelihood of affiliation contract renewals, and at least on an annual basis. For purposes of goodwill impairment tests, the Company has aggregated television stations reporting unit because of the stations similar economic characteristics, cable network reporting unit, and digital business reporting units. The Company s impairment review for FCC licenses is performed at the television station market level. The Company first assesses the qualitative factors to determine the likelihood of the goodwill and FCC licenses being impaired. The qualitative analysis includes, but is not limited to, assessing the changes in macroeconomic conditions, regulatory environment, industry and market conditions, and the financial performance versus budget of the reporting units, as well as any other events or circumstances specific to the reporting units or the FCC licenses. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill or a station s FCC license is greater than its carrying amount, no further testing will be required. Otherwise, the Company will apply the quantitative impairment test method. The quantitative impairment test for goodwill is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The quantitative impairment test for FCC licenses consists of a market-by-market comparison of the carrying amounts of FCC licenses with their fair values, using the Greenfield Method of discounted cash flow analysis. An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an FCC license exceeds its fair value. Determining the fair value of reporting units and FCC licenses requires management to make judgments about assumptions and estimates that are highly subjective and that are based on unobservable inputs. The actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and it is possible that such differences could have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to the various inputs (e.g. revenue growth, operating profit margins, capital expenditures, discount rates) used to calculate the fair value of reporting units, the Company evaluates the reasonableness of its assumptions by comparing the total fair value of all its reporting units to its total market capitalization and by comparing the fair values of its reporting units to recent market sale transactions. The Company tests definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable, relying on certain factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections and anticipated future cash flows. The carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the projected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the asset or asset group over its remaining life, or primary asset s life, plus proceeds received from its eventual disposition are less than its carrying value. The Company measures impairment based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the long-lived asset or asset group. The fair value is determined primarily by using the projected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved as well as market valuations.

 ASU 2021-05 effective . The adoption have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting ASU 2020-04 ). In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope ASU 2021-01 ). Together, these accounting updates provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contract modifications and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. ASU 2020-04 provides, among other things, guidance that modifications of contracts within the scope of Topic 470, Debt, should be accounted for by prospectively adjusting the effective interest rate; modifications of contracts within the scope of Topic 842, Leases, should be accounted for as a continuation of the existing contract; and changes in the critical terms of hedging relationships caused by reference rate reform should not result in the de-designation of the instrument, provided certain criteria are met. ASU 2021-01 clarifies the scope and application of ASU 2020-04 and among other things, permits entities to elect certain optional expedients and exceptions when accounting for derivative contracts and certain hedging relationships affected by changes in the interest rates used for discounting cash flows. ASU 2020-04 was amended by ASU No. 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 issued by FASB in December 2022, which defers the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief in Topic 848. In June 2022, the Company applied the optional expedients provided by these accounting updates for contract modifications to the amendment of its senior credit facilities. The adoption of these accounting updates have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers ASU 2021-08 ). The amendments in this ASU require that an entity (acquirer) recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606. At the acquisition date, an acquirer should account for the related revenue contracts in accordance with Topic 606 as if it had originated the contracts. This ASU also provides certain practical expedients for acquirers when recognizing and measuring acquired contract assets and contract liabilities from revenue contracts in a business combination. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company will evaluate the potential impacts ASU 2021-08 may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements upon its adoption on effective date as it relates to future acquisitions.

, Nexstar completed its acquisition of a ownership interest in The CW from affiliates of Paramount Global and Warner Bros. Discovery (collectively the Sellers for no purchase consideration. Each of the Sellers retained a ownership interest and will produce 12 original, scripted series for The CW primarily to air during the 2022/2023 broadcast season. The Sellers have granted Nexstar a call right and Nexstar has granted each of the Sellers a put right for such Seller s ownership interests beginning in August 2024 and June 2026, respectively. The acquisition solidifies Nexstar s revenue opportunities as the largest owner of The CW-affiliated stations, diversifies its content outside of news, improves its national advertising opportunities, establishes it as a participant in advertising video-on-demand services via The CW App and is expected to create value by improving The CW s ratings, revenue, and profitability. The transaction was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting.

Gain on bargain purchase 

Programming costs and accrued programming costs pertain to The CW s costs of acquiring programming from the Sellers and were valued using the replacement cost method as of Nexstar s acquisition due to their short-term nature. As a result of the acquisition, Nexstar recognized a gain on bargain purchase of million representing the excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired over the purchase consideration paid and the fair value of the noncontrolling interests. This gain is presented as a separate line item in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income during the year ended December 31, 2022. Nexstar believes it was able to acquire The CW for 0 purchase consideration due to the recurring losses of The CW and Nexstar s position as the largest owner of The CW-affiliated television stations which it believes limited the number of interested acquirers, Nexstar s agreement to commit The CW to acquire additional programming from the Sellers for the 2022/2023 broadcast season, and Nexstar s agreement to allow the Sellers to distribute certain short and long-term accounts receivable related to previously-aired programming to the Sellers prior to closing. The intangible assets are amortized over an estimated useful life of years beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022. The CW s net revenue of million and operating loss of million from the acquisition date to December 31, 2022 has been included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Transaction costs related to this acquisition, including severance costs, retention bonuses and legal and professional fees totaling million were included in selling, general and administrative expense, excluding depreciation and amortization in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. 2021 Acquisitions Acquisition of The Hill On , pursuant to a merger agreement, Nexstar acquired of the outstanding equity of News Communications, Inc. NCI ), then a Nevada corporation, for a total cash consideration of approximately million, including working capital adjustments, funded by cash on hand. NCI is the owner of The Hill, an independent, political digital media platform. On August 27, 2021, NCI received approval for its conversion from a Nevada corporation to a Delaware corporation. The acquisition marked the continuation of Nexstar s content-first strategy, focused primarily on news, designed to further leverage and monetize its expansive digital reach.

As discussed in Note 2, the Company has aggregated television stations reporting unit, cable network reporting unit, and two digital reporting units for purposes of annual goodwill impairment review as of December 31, 2022. The Company s annual impairment review of FCC licenses is performed at the station market level. Management conducts an impairment test annually in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill or FCC licenses might be impaired. In the fourth quarter of 2022, using the qualitative impairment test, the Company performed its annual impairment assessment on goodwill attributable to its aggregated television stations reporting unit and cable network reporting unit. Based on the results of such qualitative impairment tests, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that each reporting unit s fair value would sufficiently exceed the related carrying amount. The Company also performed its annual impairment assessment on FCC licenses for each television station market using the qualitative impairment test and concluded that it was more likely than not that their fair values exceeded the respective carrying amounts. Thus, no impairment was recorded on the associated goodwill and FCC licenses. With respect to the Company s digital reporting units, the Company elected to perform quantitative impairment tests due to uncertain economic conditions in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Company s assessment indicated that the fair value of one digital reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount by over , and therefore goodwill impairment was identified. Goodwill associated with this reporting unit was million as of December 31, 2022. In the second digital reporting unit, the Company identified a partial goodwill impairment of million. The impairment was identified in the fourth quarter of 2022 given the operating performance of the reporting unit, the seasonality of the business and changes in the outlook of the business. The fair value was estimated using a combination of an income approach, which employs a discounted cash flow model, and market approaches. The significant assumptions used in estimating fair value included: (i) compound annual growth rates for revenues ranging from to , (ii) operating profit margins ranging from to , (iii) an income tax rate of based on statutory federal and blended state tax rates, (iv) a discount rate of based on an analysis of e-commerce companies, (v) a terminal growth rate of based on a mature company in the e-commerce industry, and (vi) market net revenue and earnings multiples of comparable publicly traded businesses. As of December 31, 2022, this second digital reporting unit has an immaterial remaining goodwill balance. The Company s quantitative goodwill impairment tests are sensitive to changes in key assumptions used in our analysis, such as expected future cash flows and market trends. If the assumptions used in its analysis are not realized, it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future. The Company cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. The Company also performed qualitative tests on its definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets. Based on the estimate of undiscounted future pre-tax cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of such assets, the Company determined that the carrying amounts are recoverable except for an immaterial impairment on definite-lived intangible assets of one digital reporting unit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022. No other events or circumstances were noted in 2022 that would indicate impairment.

billion, which were substantially funded by combined plan assets of billion, or approximately funded (underfunded by million). All these retirement plans are frozen in terms of pay and service, except for a plan with immaterial pension benefit obligations. The remaining pension obligations of million relate to non-contributory unfunded supplemental executive retirement and ERISA Excess plans for which Nexstar s policy is to fund the benefits as claims and premiums are paid. Nexstar also has various retiree medical savings account plans which reimburse eligible retired employees for certain medical expenses and unfunded plans that provide certain health and life insurance benefits to certain retired employees. Nexstar uses a December 31 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans OPEB ). The overfunded or underfunded status of these pension and other postretirement plans is recognized as an asset or liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The changes in the funded status are recorded in the year in which changes occur through comprehensive income (loss). The funded status of a plan represents the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the related plan projected benefit obligation.

The increase in the discount rates from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 decreased the projected benefit obligations of qualified defined benefit pension plans by approximately million at December 31, 2022. Additionally, the updated mortality projection scale decreased the plans projected pension obligations by approximately million at December 31, 2022. The decreases were partially offset by an approximately million increase in pension obligations due to the updated census information and cash balance crediting rate assumption. The increase in the discount rates from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 decreased the projected benefit obligations of qualified defined benefit pension plans by approximately million at December 31, 2021. Additionally, the updated mortality projection scale decreased the plans projected pension obligations by approximately million at December 31, 2021. The decreases were partially offset by an approximately million increase in pension obligations due to the updated census information and a change to the assumed commencement age and optional form elections for deferred vested participants.

The reasonableness of the expected return on the funded retirement plan assets was assessed with the assistance of an investment consultant, but all assumptions were reviewed by management. Their proprietary model simulates possible capital market scenarios based on the current economic environment and their capital market assumptions to come up with expected returns for the portfolio based on the current asset allocation. For purposes of measuring the related postretirement health care costs for 2022, we assumed a annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to for 2030 and remain at that level thereafter. For purposes of measuring the related postretirement health care obligations at December 31, 2022, we assumed a - annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits.

As the plan sponsor of the funded retirement plans, Nexstar s investment strategy is to achieve a rate of return on the plans assets that, over the long term, will fund the plans benefit payments and will provide for other required amounts in a manner that satisfies all fiduciary responsibilities. A determinant of the plans returns is the asset allocation policy. The investment policies for plan assets provide ranges for the plans long-term asset mix, as follows: For plan assets with a total fair value of billion as of December 31, 2022, the investment policy ranges are - U.S. equity, - non-U.S. equity, - emerging market equity, - global equity, - opportunistic sub-asset classes, 5 -7 fixed income and - cash. 

 For plan assets with a total fair value of million as of December 31, 2022, the investment policy ranges are - U.S. equity, - non-U.S. equity, - emerging market equity, - global low volatility equity, - opportunistic sub-asset classes, 7 -9 fixed income and - cash. 

 Nexstar also reviews the plans overall asset allocation to determine the proper balance of securities by market capitalization, value or growth, U.S., international or global or the addition of other asset classes. The investment policies are reviewed frequently and administered by an investment consultant. Periodically, Nexstar evaluates each investment with the investment consultant to determine if the overall portfolio has performed satisfactorily when compared to the defined objectives, similarly invested portfolios and specific market indices. Investments in Common Collective Trust Funds do not have any unfunded commitments and do not have any applicable liquidation periods or defined terms and periods to be held. The portfolios offer daily liquidity; however, they request 5 business days notice for both withdrawals and redemptions. Strategies of the Common Collective Trust Funds by major category are as follows: Equity Common Collective Trusts are primarily invested in funds seeking investment results that correspond to the total return performance of their respective benchmarks in both the U.S. and international markets. Equity securities are invested broadly in U.S. and non-U.S. companies and are diversified across countries, currencies, market capitalizations and investment styles. These securities use the S P 500 (U.S. large cap), Russell 2000 (U.S. small cap), Russell 2500 (U.S. mid cap) and MSCI All Country World Index ex-U.S. (non-U.S.) as their benchmarks. 

 Fixed Income Common Collective Trusts are primarily invested in funds with an investment objective to provide investment returns through fixed-income and commingled investment vehicles that seek to outperform their respective benchmarks. Fixed income securities are invested in diversified portfolios that invest across the maturity spectrum and include primarily investment-grade securities with a minimum average quality rating of A and insurance annuity contracts. These securities use the Barclays Capital Aggregate (intermediate term bonds), Barclays Capital Long Corporate and Barclays Capital Long Government/Credit (long bonds) U.S. Bond Indexes as their benchmarks. 

 Real Estate and Real Asset Common Collective Trusts seek to achieve high current return and long-term capital growth by investing in equity securities of real estate investment trusts that seek to outperform their respective benchmarks. 

 Other investments include investments in real estate funds, emerging market debt, high yield bonds, commodity index fund, floating rate debt, and inflation-protected bond. These investments use the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries Property Index or the FTSE NAREIT All Equity REIT Index (real estate), JPM EMBI Global Core Index (emerging market debt), Barclays U.S. High Yield Ba/B 1 Issuer Capped Bond Index (high yield bonds), BBG Commodity Index (commodity index fund), Morningstar LSTA US Loan (floating rate debt) and BBG 1-10 TIPS (inflation-protected bond) as their benchmarks.

Registered investment companies are valued at exchange listed prices for exchange traded registered investment companies, which are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Common/collective trusts are valued on the basis of the relative interest of each participating investor in the fair value of the underlying assets of each of the respective common/collective trusts. Common/collective trusts contain underlying assets valued based on pricing from observable market information in a non-active market and are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain common/collective trusts, investment companies and real estate that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in the table above are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the total value of plan assets. The pooled separate account represents an insurance contract under which plan assets are administered through pooled funds. The PSA portfolio includes investments in money market instruments, government and corporate bonds and notes. The PSA is valued daily based on the market value of the underlying net assets in the separate account. The majority of the underlying net assets have observable Level 1 and/or 2 quoted pricing inputs which are used to determine the unit value of the PSA which is not publicly quoted and therefore classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Defined Contribution Plans The Company has established retirement savings plans under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the 401(k) Plans ). The 401(k) Plans cover substantially all Company employees who meet the minimum age and service requirements and allow participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis. Employer contributions to the 401(k) Plans may be made at the discretion of management of the Company. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 , Nexstar contributed million, million and million, respectively, to the 401(k) Plans. The Company has a Supplemental Income Deferral Plan for which certain employees, including executive officers, are eligible. The plan provides benefits to highly compensated employees in circumstances in which the maximum limits established under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code prevent them from receiving Company contributions. The amounts recorded by the Company for these plans for 2022 are immaterial.

Income tax expense 

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Act was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. The Act reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from to effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Although the federal corporate income tax rate reduction is only effective for tax periods beginning after December 31, 2017, ASC 740 requires the Company to remeasure the existing net deferred tax liability in the period of enactment. of the costs of qualified property that are incurred and placed in service during the period from September 27, 2017 to December 31, 2022. Beginning January 1, 2023, the immediate expensing provision is phased down by per year until it is completely phased out as of January 1, 2027. Additionally, effective January 1, 2018, the Act modifies the executive compensation deduction limitation and imposes possible limitations on the deductibility of interest expense. As a result of these provisions of the Act, the Company s deduction related to executive compensation and interest expense could be limited in future years.

As of December 31, 2022 , the Company s reserve for uncertain tax positions totaled approximately million. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 there were million, million and million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, respectively, that would reduce the effective tax rate if the underlying tax positions were sustained or settled favorably. The Company has not recorded any tax reserves related to the Chicago Cubs Transactions as further described in Note 16.

Uncertain tax position liability at the end of the year 

The Company s liability for unrecognized tax benefits totaled million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. If all of the unrecognized tax benefits at those dates had been recognized, there would have been a favorable million and million impact on the Company s reported income tax expense in 2022 and 2021, respectively. As allowed by ASC Topic 740, the Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The Company s accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were million, million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Although management believes its estimates and judgments are reasonable, the resolutions of the Company s tax issues are unpredictable and could result in tax liabilities that are significantly higher or lower than those which have been provided by the Company. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately million within the next twelve months due to the resolution of tax examination issues and statute of limitations expirations. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from any tax examinations will not have a significant impact on the amount of such liabilities, which could have an impact on the operating results or financial position of the Company. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions. The Tribune acquired entities are currently undergoing federal audits for tax periods including 2014 2015 and 2018 2019. Protective claims for refund have been filed for 2013, 2016 and 2017 to keep the periods open for specific issues relating to the potential Cubs resolution. Nexstar is subject to U.S. federal tax examinations for years after 2018. The Company currently has various state income tax returns in the process of examination or administrative appeal. Additionally, any NOLs that were generated in prior years and utilized in the current year or future years may also be subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. Generally, the Company is subject to state tax examination for years after 2017 and any NOLs that were generated in prior years and utilized in the current year or future years may also be subject to examination. The Company has gross federal and state income tax NOL carryforwards of million and million, respectively, which are available to reduce future taxable income if utilized before their expiration. A valuation allowance has been recorded against million of federal NOLs and million of state NOLs attributable to one of the consolidated VIEs. The federal NOLs expire through 2037 if not utilized. Federal NOLs generated after 2017 carry forward indefinitely. State NOLs will expire through 2041 if not utilized. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of NOLs that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in stock ownership. Ownership changes are evaluated as they occur and could limit the ability to use NOLs. As of December 31, 2022, the Company does not expect any NOLs to expire as a result of Section 382 limitations. The ability to use NOLs is also dependent upon the Company s ability to generate taxable income. The NOLs could expire before the Company generates sufficient taxable income. To the extent the Company s use of NOLs is significantly limited, the Company s income could be subject to corporate income tax earlier than it would if it were able to use NOLs, which could have a negative effect on the Company s financial results and operations. 

of the top four stations in a market in terms of audience share (unless a case-by-case exception is granted) and from owning stations that reach more than of U.S. television households (as calculated using a prescribed FCC methodology). Nexstar is also prohibited from providing more than percent of the programming of a non-owned television station through a TBA or LMA if Nexstar also owns a station in the same market, unless the applicable TBA or LMA was entered into prior to November 5, 1996 . The FCC is required to review its media ownership rules every four years and to eliminate those rules it finds are no longer necessary in the public interest as a result of competition. The FCC s two most recent quadrennial reviews those for 2010 and 2014 were eventually consolidated into a single proceeding that involved extensive litigation, an agency reconsideration and multiple court appeals, culminating in an April 1, 2021 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court which upheld the FCC s elimination or relaxation of several rules. The 2018 quadrennial review, which the FCC commenced in December 2018, remains pending, and the FCC has solicited and received comments to update the record of that proceeding in the wake of the Supreme Court s decision. Notwithstanding the pendency of the 2018 review, in December 2022 the FCC commenced its 2022 quadrennial review proceeding. Additionally, the FCC has an open proceeding to review the national television station ownership limit. Thus, the media ownership rules are subject to change as a result of current and future quadrennial reviews and in other proceedings. Spectrum The FCC has repurposed a portion of the broadcast television spectrum for wireless broadband use. Pursuant to federal legislation enacted in 2012, the FCC conducted an incentive auction in 2016-2017 for the purpose of making additional spectrum available to meet future wireless broadband needs. Under the auction statute and rules, certain television broadcasters accepted bids from the FCC to voluntarily relinquish their spectrum in exchange for consideration, and certain wireless broadband providers and other entities submitted successful bids to acquire the relinquished television spectrum. Television stations that did not relinquish their spectrum were repacked into the frequency band still remaining for television broadcast use. In 2017, the Company received payment for eleven television stations that accepted bids and either moved to different channels or (in one case) discontinued operations. Seventy-four full power stations owned by Nexstar and full power stations owned by VIEs were assigned to new channels in the reduced post-auction television band. These stations have commenced operation on their new assigned channels and have ceased operating on their former channels. The Company is in the final stages of obtaining reimbursements for the costs of repacking these stations. Retransmission Consent Broadcasters may obtain carriage of their stations signals on cable, satellite and other MVPDs through either mandatory carriage or through retransmission consent. Every three years all stations must formally elect either mandatory carriage or retransmission consent. The next election must be made by October 1, 2023 and will be effective January 1, 2024. Must-carry elections require that the MVPD carry one station programming stream and related data in the station s local market. However, MVPDs may decline a must-carry election in certain circumstances. MVPDs do not pay a fee to stations that elect mandatory carriage. A broadcaster that elects retransmission consent waives its mandatory carriage rights, and the broadcaster and the MVPD must negotiate for carriage of the station s signal. Negotiated terms may include channel position, service tier carriage, carriage of multiple program streams, compensation and other consideration. If a broadcaster elects to negotiate retransmission terms, it is possible that the broadcaster and the MVPD will not reach agreement and that the MVPD will not carry the station s signal. FCC rules and federal statutory law require retransmission consent negotiations to be conducted in good faith. It is a violation of the duty to negotiate in good faith for a television broadcast station to negotiate retransmission consent jointly with another station in the same market if the stations are not commonly owned. Accordingly, the VIEs with which we have sharing agreements must separately negotiate their retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs for stations in markets where we also own a station. MVPD operators have actively sought to change the regulations under which retransmission consent is negotiated before both the U.S. Congress and the FCC in order to increase their bargaining leverage with television stations. There are still-open FCC proceedings to review the totality of the circumstances test for good faith retransmission consent negotiations, and to eliminate or modify the FCC s non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules (which could permit MVPDs to import out-of-market television stations in certain circumstances). Certain OVDs have successfully or unsuccessfully sought to stream broadcast programming over the internet. In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court held that an OVD s retransmissions of broadcast television signals without the consent of the broadcast station violate federal copyright law. In December 2014, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to interpret the term MVPD to encompass OVDs that make available for purchase multiple streams of video programming distributed at a prescheduled time and seeking comment on the effects of applying MVPD rules to such OVDs. The proceeding remains open. Although the FCC has not classified OVDs as MVPDs to date, several OVDs have signed agreements for retransmission of local stations within their markets, and others are actively seeking to negotiate such agreements.

Guarantee of Mission Debt Nexstar (excluding The CW) guarantees full payment of all obligations incurred under the Mission senior secured credit facility. In the event that Mission is unable to repay amounts due, Nexstar will be obligated to repay such amounts. The maximum potential amount of future payments that Nexstar would be required to make under this guarantee would be generally limited to the outstanding principal amounts. As of December 31, 2022 , Mission had a maximum commitment of million under its amended credit agreement, of which million principal balance of debt was outstanding. Indemnification Obligations In connection with certain agreements that the Company enters into in the normal course of its business, including local service agreements, business acquisitions and borrowing arrangements, the Company enters into contractual arrangements under which the Company agrees to indemnify the third party to such arrangement from losses, claims and damages incurred by the indemnified party for certain events as defined within the particular contract. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses and the maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification arrangements may be unlimited. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been insignificant and the Company has not incurred significant costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. Collective Bargaining Agreements As of December 31, 2022 , certain technical, production and news employees at of the Company s stations are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company believes that employee relations are satisfactory and has not experienced any work stoppages at any of its stations. However, there can be no assurance that the collective bargaining agreements will be renewed in the future or that the Company will not experience a prolonged labor dispute, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, or results of operations. Litigation From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation that arises from the ordinary operations of business, such as contractual or employment disputes or other general actions. In the event of an adverse outcome of these proceedings, the Company believes the resulting liabilities would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. Local TV Advertising Antitrust Litigation On March 16, 2018, a group of companies including Nexstar and Tribune (the Defendants received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice DOJ regarding an investigation into the exchange of certain information related to the pacing of sales related to the same period in the prior year among broadcast stations in some DMAs in alleged violation of federal antitrust law. Without admitting any wrongdoing, some Defendants, including Tribune, entered into a proposed consent decree (referred to herein as the consent decree with the DOJ on November 6, 2018. Without admitting any wrongdoing, Nexstar agreed to settle the matter with the DOJ on December 5, 2018. The consent decree was entered in final form by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on May 22, 2019. The consent decree, which settles claims by the government of alleged violations of federal antitrust laws in connection with the alleged information sharing, does not include any financial penalty. Pursuant to the consent decree, Nexstar and Tribune agreed not to exchange certain non-public information with other stations operating in the same DMA except in certain cases, and to implement certain antitrust compliance measures and to monitor and report on compliance with the consent decree. Starting in July 2018, a series of plaintiffs filed putative class action lawsuits against the Defendants and others alleging that they coordinated their pricing of television advertising, thereby harming a proposed class of all buyers of television advertising time from one or more of the Defendants since at least January 1, 2014. The plaintiff in each lawsuit seeks injunctive relief and money damages caused by the alleged antitrust violations. On October 9, 2018, these cases were consolidated in a multi-district litigation in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois captioned In Re: Local TV Advertising Antitrust Litigation , No. 1:18-cv-06785 MDL Litigation ). On January 23, 2019, the Court in the MDL Litigation appointed plaintiffs lead and liaison counsel. The MDL Litigation is ongoing. The Plaintiffs Consolidated Complaint was filed on ; Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss on . Before the Court ruled on that motion, the Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Consolidated Complaint on . This complaint added additional defendants and allegations. The Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss and Strike on . The Court denied that motion on November 6, 2020. On March 16, 2022, the Plaintiffs filed their Third Amended Complaint. The Third Amended Complaint adds two additional plaintiffs and an additional defendant, but does not make material changes to the allegations. The parties are in the discovery phase of litigation. The Court has not yet set a trial date. Nexstar and Tribune deny all allegations against them and will defend their advertising practices. In connection with Nexstar s acquisition of Tribune on September 19, 2019, Nexstar assumed contingencies from certain legal proceedings, as follows: Tribune Chapter 11 Reorganization and Confirmation Order Appeals On December 8, 2008, Tribune and 110 of its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 Chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the Bankruptcy Court ). On July 23, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order confirming the Fourth Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization for Tribune and its Subsidiaries (as such plan was subsequently modified by its proponents, the Plan ). The Plan became effective and the Debtors emerged from Chapter 11 on December 31, 2012 (the Effective Date ). The Bankruptcy Court has entered final decrees that have collectively closed all of the Debtors Chapter 11 cases except for Tribune s Chapter 11 case, which continues to be administered under the caption In re Tribune Media Company, et al. , Case No. 08-13141. As of the Effective Date, approximately proofs of claim had been filed against the Debtors. Amounts and payment terms for these claims, if applicable, were established in the Plan. The Plan requires Tribune to reserve cash in amounts sufficient to make certain additional payments that may become due and owing pursuant to the Plan subsequent to the Effective Date. As of December 31, 2022, restricted cash and cash equivalents held by Tribune to satisfy the remaining claim obligations were million and are estimated to be sufficient to satisfy such obligations. As of December 31, 2022, all but three proofs of claim against the Debtors had been withdrawn, expunged, settled or otherwise satisfied. Those claims were resolved with Bankruptcy Court approval in January 2023. The amount of such resolution did not exceed the restricted cash and cash equivalents held by Tribune to satisfy remaining claim obligations described above. In the event any additional claims were to be allowed that exceeded the amount of restricted cash and cash equivalents held by Tribune, Tribune would be required to satisfy the allowed claims from its cash on hand from operations. Chicago Cubs Transactions On August 21, 2009, Tribune and Chicago Entertainment Ventures, LLC (formerly Chicago Baseball Holdings, LLC) CEV LLC ), and its subsidiaries (collectively, New Cubs LLC ), among other parties, entered into an agreement (the Cubs Formation Agreement governing the contribution of certain assets and liabilities related to the businesses of the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball franchise then owned by Tribune and its subsidiaries to New Cubs LLC. The transactions contemplated by the Cubs Formation Agreement and the related agreements thereto (the Chicago Cubs Transactions closed on October 27, 2009. As a result of these transactions, Northside Entertainment Holdings LLC (f/k/a Ricketts Acquisition LLC) NEH owned and Tribune owned of the membership interests in CEV LLC. The fair market value of the contributed assets exceeded the tax basis and did not result in an immediate taxable gain as the transaction was structured to comply with the partnership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code IRC and related regulations. On June 28, 2016, the Internal Revenue Service IRS issued Tribune a Notice of Deficiency which presented the IRS s position that the gain with respect to the Chicago Cubs Transactions should have been included in Tribune s 2009 taxable income. Accordingly, the IRS proposed a million tax and a million gross valuation misstatement penalty. During the third quarter of 2016, Tribune filed a petition in U.S. Tax Court to contest the IRS s determination. After-tax interest on the aforementioned proposed tax and penalty through December 31, 2022 would be approximately million. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its position, under the tax rules for determining tax basis upon emergence from bankruptcy, the Company would be required to reduce its tax basis in certain assets. The reduction in tax basis would be required to reflect the reduction in the amount of the Company s guarantee of the New Cubs partnership debt which was included in the reported tax basis previously determined upon emergence from bankruptcy and subject to Tribune s 2014 and 2015 Federal Income Tax Audits (described below). On September 19, 2019, Tribune became a wholly owned subsidiary of Nexstar following Nexstar s merger with Tribune. Nexstar disagrees with the IRS s position that the Chicago Cubs Transactions generated taxable gain in 2009, the proposed penalty and the IRS s calculation of the gain. If the IRS prevails in its position, the gain on the Chicago Cubs Transactions would be deemed to be taxable in 2009. Nexstar estimates that the federal and state income taxes would be approximately million before interest and penalties. Any tax, interest and penalty due will be offset by tax payments made relating to this transaction subsequent to 2009. Tribune made approximately million of tax payments prior to its merger with Nexstar. A bench trial in the U.S. Tax Court took place between October 28, 2019 and November 8, 2019, and closing arguments took place on December 11, 2019. The Tax Court issued a separate opinion on January 6, 2020 holding that the IRS satisfied the procedural requirements for the imposition of the gross valuation misstatement penalty. The judge deferred any litigation of the penalty until a final determination was reached by the Tax Court or Court of Appeals. On October 26, 2021, the Tax Court issued an opinion related to the Chicago Cubs Transactions, which held that Tribune s structure was, in substantial part, in compliance with partnership provisions of the Code and, as a result, did not trigger the entire 2009 taxable gain proposed by the IRS. On October 19, 2022, the Tax Court entered the decision that there is no tax deficiency or penalty due in the 2009 tax year. On January 13, 2023, the IRS filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. On February 3, 2023, the Company filed a notice of cross-appeal. As of December 31, 2022, Nexstar believes the tax impact of applying the Tax Court opinion to 2009 and its impact on subsequent tax years is not material to the Company s accounting for uncertain tax positions or to its Consolidated Financial Statements. Although management believes its estimates and judgments are reasonable, the timing and ultimate resolution are unpredictable and could materially change. Revenue Agent s Report on Tribune s 2014 to 2015 Federal Income Tax Audits Prior to Nexstar s merger with Tribune in September 2019, Tribune was undergoing federal income tax audits for taxable years 2014 and 2015. In the third quarter of 2020, the IRS completed its audits of Tribune and issued a Revenue Agent s Report which disallows the reporting of certain assets and liabilities related to Tribune s emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy on December 31, 2012. Nexstar disagrees with the IRS s proposed adjustments to the tax basis of certain assets and the related taxable income impact, and Nexstar is contesting the adjustments through the IRS administrative appeal procedures. If the IRS prevails in its position and after taking into account the impact of the Tax Court opinion, Nexstar would be required to reduce its tax basis in certain assets resulting in a million increase in its federal and state taxes payable and a million increase in deferred income tax liability as of December 31, 2022. In accordance with ASC Topic 740, the Company has reflected million for certain contested issues in its liability for uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

The Company primarily derives its revenues from television and digital advertising and from distribution of its stations signals and networks. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, revenues from these sources for of the Company s customers exceeded 10 . In 2022, each of these customers represented approximately , and , respectively, of the Company s consolidated net revenues. In 2021, each of these customers represented approximately , and , respectively, of the Company s consolidated net revenues. In 2020, each of these customers represented approximately of the Company s consolidated net revenues. Advertising revenue (core, political and digital) is positively affected by national and regional political campaigns and certain events such as the Olympic Games or the Super Bowl. Company stations advertising revenue is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to, and including, the holiday season. In addition, advertising revenue is generally higher during even-numbered years when congressional and presidential elections occur and advertising is aired during the Olympic Games. The Company receives compensation from MVPDs and OVDs in return for the consent to the retransmission of the signals of its television stations and the carriage of NewsNation. Distribution revenue is recognized at the point in time the broadcast signal is delivered to the distributors and is based on a price per subscriber.

 Preemptive Rights 
 No holders of common stock have any preemptive rights with respect to the common stock or any other securities of the Company, or to any obligations convertible (directly or indirectly) into securities of the Company. 
 Transfer Restrictions and Redemption 
 If the Company has reason to believe that the Ownership, or proposed Ownership, of shares of capital stock of the Company by any stockholder, other Owner or Proposed Transferee could, either by itself or when taken together with the Ownership of any shares of capital stock of the Company by any other Person, result in any Violation (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation), such stockholder, other Owner or Proposed Transferee, upon request of the Company, shall promptly furnish to the Company such information (including information with respect to citizenship, other Ownership interests and affiliations) as the Company may reasonably request to determine whether the Ownership of, or the exercise of any rights with respect to, shares of capital stock of the Company by such stockholder, other Owner or Proposed Transferee could result in any Violation. 
 If (a) any stockholder, other Owner or Proposed Transferee from whom information is requested should fail to respond to such request within the period of time (including any applicable extension thereof) determined by the board of directors, or (b) whether or not any stockholder, other Owner or Proposed Transferee timely responds to any request for information, the board of directors shall conclude that effecting, permitting or honoring any Transfer or the Ownership of any shares of capital stock of the Company, by any such stockholder, other Owner or Proposed Transferee, could result in any Violation, or that it is in the interest of the Company to prevent or cure any such Violation or any situation which could result in any such Violation, or mitigate the effects of any such Violation or any situation that could result in any such Violation, then the Company may, inter alia : (1) refuse to permit any Transfer of record of shares of capital stock of the Company that involves a Transfer of such shares to, or Ownership of such shares by, any Disqualified Person; (ii) refuse to honor any such Transfer of record effected or purported to have been effected, and in such case any such Transfer of record shall be deemed to have been void ab initio; (iii) suspend those rights of stock ownership the exercise of which could result in any Violation; (iv) redeem such shares, in accordance with the paragraph below and/or (v) take all such other action as the board of directors may deem necessary or advisable, including exercising any and all appropriate remedies, at law or in equity, in any court of competent jurisdiction, against any Disqualified Person. 
 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, but subject to the provisions of any resolution or resolutions of the board of directors creating any series of preferred stock, outstanding shares of common stock or preferred stock shall always be subject to redemption by the Company, by action of the board of directors, if in the judgment of the board of directors such action should be taken with respect to any shares of capital stock of the Company of which any Disqualified Person is the stockholder, other Owner or Proposed Transferee. The terms and conditions of such redemption shall be as set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation. 
 Takeover Defense 
 Certain provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws and the DGCL have anti-takeover effects and could delay, discourage, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider to be in the stockholder s best interests, including attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by stockholders, and may make removal of the incumbent management and directors more difficult. 
 Authorized Shares. The authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock will be available for future issuance without stockholder approval. These additional shares may be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional capital, corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of Nexstar by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise. 
 The board of directors of Nexstar will have the sole authority to determine the terms of any one or more series of preferred stock, including voting rights, dividend rates, conversion and redemption rights, and liquidation preferences. As a result of the ability to fix voting rights for a series of preferred stock, the board of directors will have the power to the extent consistent with its legal duties to issue a series of preferred stock to persons friendly to management in order to attempt to block a tender offer, merger or other transaction by which a third-party seeks control of Nexstar, and thereby assist members of management to retain their positions. 
 2 

Special Meetings of Stockholders. Under the Bylaws and subject to the rights of any series of preferred stock that may be issued by Nexstar, special meetings of stockholders may be called solely by the board of directors of Nexstar or by the chairman of the board of directors. 
 Action by Written Consent . Under the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, Nexstar stockholders may not take action by written consent. 
 Advance Notice of Nominations and Proposed Business for Stockholder Meetings . Under the Bylaws, only the board of directors or a stockholder of record entitled to vote at a meeting for the election of directors may nominate candidates for election to the board of directors of Nexstar at an annual meeting of stockholders or present business for consideration by the stockholders at an annual meeting. 
 The Bylaws require that a stockholder who desires to nominate a candidate for election to the board of directors at an annual meeting or present business at an annual meeting to provide notice to the Secretary of Nexstar in advance of the meeting. The notice must be in proper form and set forth various information related to the stockholder giving the notice and the applicable nomination or proposal. Notice of such stockholder nomination or proposal must be received by Nexstar not later than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year s annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than 30 days, or delayed by more than 90 days, from such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the later of the close of business on the 90th day prior to such annual meeting and the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which the public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by Nexstar. 
 Classified Board of Directors . The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that the size of Nexstar s board of directors will be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by a majority of the board of directors of Nexstar and that the directors shall be divided into three classes, with directors serving staggered three year terms. The classification of Nexstar s board of directors has the effect of making it more difficult for stockholders to change the composition of Nexstar s board of directors. At least two annual meetings of stockholders, instead of one, will generally be required to effect a change in a majority of Nexstar s board of directors. This may have the effect of discouraging a third-party from initiating a proxy contest, making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of Nexstar. In addition, because the classification of Nexstar s board of directors may discourage accumulations of large blocks of common stock by purchasers whose objective is to take control of Nexstar and remove a majority of Nexstar s board of directors, the classification of Nexstar s board of directors could tend to reduce the likelihood of fluctuations in the market price of common stock that might result from accumulations of large blocks of common stock for such a purpose. Accordingly, Nexstar stockholders could be deprived of certain opportunities to sell their common stock at a higher market price than might otherwise be the case. 
 Delaware Business Combination Statute . Nexstar is subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, an anti-takeover law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder, unless (with some exceptions) the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Generally, an interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns (or within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status, did own) 15 or more of a corporation s voting stock. As permitted by Section 203, Nexstar has elected not to be governed by Section 203 with respect to ABRY and any entity controlled by ABRY, and therefore, unless Nexstar s Certificate of Incorporation is amended, neither ABRY nor any such entity shall be deemed to be an interested stockholder. The existence of this provision could have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the board of directors, including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for common stock. 
 Other Matters 
 Limitation on Director s Liability. The Certificate of Incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, Nexstar will indemnify and advance expenses of any director or officer who is made or threatened to be made a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of Nexstar. In addition, no director or officer of the combined company will be liable to the combined company or its stockholders for monetary damages with respect to any transaction, occurrence or course of conduct. 
 Transfer Agent. The transfer agent for Nexstar is the American Stock Transfer Trust Co., Corporate Trust Department, 6201 Fifteenth Ave., Brooklyn, New York 11219.
