Results of Operations, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act (as defined

forward-looking terminology, including the words believes, estimates, anticipates, expects, 
 intends, plans, may, will, potential, projects, predicts,

can be no assurance that actual results will not materially differ from expectations. Such statements include, but are not limited to,
any statements relating to our ability to consummate any acquisition or other business combination and any other statements that are
not statements of current or historical facts. These statements are based on management s current expectations, but actual results
may differ materially due to various factors, including, but not limited to: 

our
ability to complete our initial business combination (as defined below), including the Lifezone Business Combination (as defined below); 

our success
 in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or directors following our initial business combination; 

our officers
 and directors allocating their time to other businesses and potentially having conflicts of interest with our business or in approving
 our initial business combination, as a result of which they would then receive expense reimbursements;

 ability to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination; 

the ability
 of our officers and directors to generate a number of potential acquisition opportunities; 

our pool of prospective
 target businesses; 

the ability
 of our officers and directors to generate a number of potential acquisition opportunities; 

our public
 securities potential liquidity and trading; 

the lack of
 a market for our securities; 

the use of
 proceeds not held in the trust account (as defined below) or available to us from interest income on the trust account balance; or 

our financial
 performance. 

The forward-looking statements
contained in this Report are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects
on us. Future developments affecting us may not be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number
of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be
materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties
materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these
forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.

PART I 

Item 1. Business. 

Overview 

We are a blank check company
incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination. 

While our efforts to identify
a target business may span many industries and regions worldwide, we have primarily focused our search for prospects within the clean/renewable
energy energy transition space. 

We intend to complete an
initial business combination with a business that is actively engaged in creating and deploying technology, services, or other offerings
that contribute to energy transition in the power generation, industrial, transportation, or other industries. We may also seek a target
in disruptive technology industries more broadly, but which still falls within our target of de-carbonization space. However, we
are not limited to these industries and we may pursue a business combination opportunity with any business or in any industry we choose. 

We believe we are well positioned
to draw upon a vast network across the energy transition and conventional energy sectors to identify opportunities with the potential
to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. 

We broadly define the energy
transition sector to include, but not be limited to: 

Utility scale solutions
 to address issues related to the dislocations caused by renewable power generation through either power storage or clean transportation
 fuel solutions; 

Hydrogen solutions for
 power storage, generation and transportation; 

Software solutions for
 managing and improving reliability of renewable power generation; 

Carbon capture and sequestration; 

Integrated case-specific solutions
 for reliable renewable power generation supply and storage; 

De-carbonization solutions
 for oil and gas, conventional power generation, agriculture, chemicals, shipping, mining, cement and other industries; and 

Upstream raw materials
 supply solutions and downstream mobility solutions for electrification. 

Initial Public Offering 

On October 25, 2021, we consummated
our initial public offering of 27,600,000 units. Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, and one-half of one redeemable warrant
of the Company, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share for 11.50 per whole share.
The units were sold at a price of 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of 276,000,000. 

Simultaneously with the closing
of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 1,335,000 placement units to our sponsor at a purchase
price of 10.00 per placement unit, generating gross proceeds of 13,350,000. 

A total of 281,520,000,
comprised of 270,480,000 of the proceeds from the initial public offering and a portion of the 13,350,000 of the proceeds of the sale
of the placement units was placed in the trust account maintained by Continental, acting as trustee. 

It is the job of our sponsor
and management team to complete our initial business combination. Our management team is led by John Dowd, our Chief Executive Officer
and Chairman, and Vikas Anand, our Chief Development Officer, who have many years of experience in identifying, investing, growing and
operating businesses in diverse sectors, including our targeted ones. 

1 

We originally had up to 15
months from the closing of our initial public offering, or until January 25, 2022, to consummate an initial business combination. However,
our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we may, but are not obligated to, extend the period of time
to consummate a business combination by an additional three months, up to two times (for a total of up to 21 months, or until July 25,
2023, to complete a business combination); provided that our sponsor (or its affiliates or designees) must deposit into the trust account
additional funds of 2,760,000 (or 0.10 per share) for each of the available three-month extensions, for a total payment of up to 5,520,000
(or 0.20 per share), in exchange for a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note. Our public shareholders will not be afforded
an opportunity to vote on our extension of time to consummate an initial business combination from 15 months to up to 21 months described
above or to redeem their shares in connection with such extension. 

On January 18, 2023, our
sponsor requested that we extend the date by which we must consummate an initial business combination from January 25, 2023 to April
25, 2023. In connection with the Extension, on January 19, 2023, we issued the Extension Note in the principal amount of 2,760,000 to
our sponsor. Also on January 19, 2023, our sponsor deposited the Extension Payment of 2,760,000 (representing 0.10 per public share)
into the trust account. This deposit enabled the Company to implement the Extension. The Extension is the first of two three-month extensions
permitted under the Company s governing documents, as described above. 

We must complete our initial
business combination by April 25, 2023 (or July 25, 2023 if we fully extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination
in accordance with the terms described in this Report), 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering. If our initial business
combination is not consummated by April 25, 2023 (or July 25, 2023 if we fully extend the period of time to consummate our initial business
combination in accordance with the terms described in this Report), then our existence will terminate, and we will distribute all amounts
in the trust account. 

Proposed Lifezone Business Combination 

Business Combination Agreement 

On December 13, 2022, the
Company, Lifezone Metals, our sponsor, Merger Sub, LHL, the LHL Shareholders Representative and the LHL Shareholders entered into the
Lifezone Business Combination Agreement, pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions precedent in the
Lifezone Business Combination Agreement, the following transactions will occur: (a) the merger of the Company with and into Merger
Sub, with Merger Sub surviving the merger and the security holders of the Company (other than the security holders of the Company electing
to redeem their ordinary shares or exercising their dissenters rights) becoming security holders of Lifezone Metals in accordance
with the Companies Act, (b) the automatic conversion and exchange of (i) each issued and outstanding public warrant of the Company for
the right to receive one Lifezone Metals public warrant and (ii) each issued and outstanding private warrant of the Company (whether or
not a whole warrant) into the right to receive one Lifezone Metals private warrant, (c) the acquisition by Lifezone Metals of all
of the issued and outstanding share capital of LHL from the LHL Shareholders in exchange for the issuance of Lifezone Metals ordinary
shares and, if applicable, the issuance of Earnout Shares (as defined in the Lifezone Business Combination Agreement), pursuant to which
LHL will become a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Lifezone Metals, and (d) the other transactions contemplated by the Business
Combination Agreement and the Lifezone Ancillary Documents referred to therein. Unless otherwise indicated, capitalized terms used in
this section of this Report titled Lifezone Business Combination but not defined have the respective meanings given to them
in the Lifezone Business Combination Agreement. References herein to the Company refer to GoGreen Investments Corporation
for all periods prior to completion of the Merger, and to Merger Sub, as the surviving company, for all periods after completion of the
Merger. 

In consideration for the Merger,

Market Opportunity 

Concerns regarding climate
change are rapidly changing the global energy sector. 

While efforts to infuse clean
and renewable sources into a fossil fuel-dominated world have been ongoing for decades, progress was stymied by clean energy s
lower returns, higher costs and over-reliance on government subsidies and regulation. For years, wind and solar projects were considered
too expensive relative to coal and natural gas options. 

Over the past decade, however,
the cost of wind and solar power has dropped to a competitive level, technologies have advanced and heightened environmental concerns
are highlighting clean energy benefits and driving new regulations and worldwide decarbonization plans. Since 2010, the cost of energy
has dropped by 82 for photovoltaic solar, by 47 for concentrated solar energy, by 39 for onshore wind and by 29 for wind offshore
according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. 

7 

As a result, we have seen
an acceleration in the energy transition away from a reliance on fossil fuels and toward a widespread acceptance of cleaner, more reliable
energy systems. In 2019, U.S. annual energy consumption from renewable sources exceeded coal consumption for the first time since before
1885 and electricity generated from renewable sources represented almost three quarters of new power capacity added in 2019. We believe
that we are leaving behind the 20 th century of fossil fuels to become the 21 st century of clean electrification,
where decarbonization of industrial sectors such as mining and manufacturing represent a massive untapped opportunity. 

This energy transition is
likely to continue for decades, providing the potential to alter global economies and geopolitics, employ millions, and improve lives,
as electricity becomes more reliable and accessible around the world. Most recent supply chain disruptions have created new opportunity
set to de-bottleneck electrification supply chain. 

Because it is in its infancy,
the energy transition industry is currently a highly fragmented and rapidly evolving segment that stands to benefit from exponential
disruptive growth in the coming years. Today, hundreds of private companies in the energy transition sector are being aided by a confluence
of positively changing marketplace dynamics, emerging clean technological solutions, social and customer demands for clean energy, and
increasing government policy support around the world. 

Our objective is to facilitate
capital access to companies that are contributing to energy transition, understanding that we are in the early stages of this disruption,
and must first bridge the gap between traditional and green energy. As a result, we will focus on products, technologies or services
sold to utilities, developers or industrial companies, including, but not limited to, technologies for carbon sequestration. 

As more intermittent power
such as wind or solar are added to the electric grid, erratic electricity prices become more common. Investment in utility-scale power
storage solutions, or innovative large-scale battery technology is needed. This is starting to occur. The U.S. Energy Information
Administration reported that, between 2010 and the end of 2018, utility scale battery storage systems increased power capacity by almost
15x and energy capacity by almost 59x. Meanwhile, lithium-ion battery pack prices have fallen 89 in real terms between 2010 and
2020, according to BloombergNEF, facilitating continued capacity expansion. Over the last decade most investments in battery technology
were geared towards high power density battery solutions used in mobility. Our team sees new utility scale storage technologies emerging
in the near future that will help to solve the problem of grid reliability in a safe way as renewables intermittent generation continues
to augment baseload conventional generation. 

The quest for carbon neutrality
and reduced carbon emissions will remain a global priority for years to come, and breakthrough technologies will be critical to that
success. We believe that companies operating in and contributing to this critical energy transition will continue to need and benefit
from broader access to public capital markets as that dynamic proceeds. 

Business Strategy and Deal Origination 

Our business strategy is
to identify and complete our initial business combination with a business that can benefit from the strategic, operational and transactional
experience of our management team. We believe that our management team is well positioned to identify attractive business combination
opportunities in industries related to energy transition as well as in broader disruptive technology sectors, which provide an opportunity
for transformational growth driven by de-carbonization. 

Our acquisition and value
creation strategy has been and will continue to be to identify and enter into a business combination with a business in the energy transition
sector and, after our initial business combination, enhance the shareholder returns for the post-combination business utilizing
the expertise of our management team, board, and executive advisors, many of whom are recognized experts in the energy transition sector.
Our business combination strategy will leverage the following attributes of our management team, board, and executive advisors: 

Broad network, proprietary
 contacts, corporate relationships (including financing providers and investment market participants, private equity groups, renewables
 developers, research institutes, think tanks supporting de-carbonization efforts around the world, investment banks, accounting
 firms, target management teams and companies or individuals that represent sellers) and industry experience of our management team
 and executive advisors developed through extensive experience in investing, operating, marketing and growing businesses in the energy
 transition industry; 

Ability to enact positive
 transformation, attractive revenue and relationship growth, operational enhancements and efficiencies to grow shareholder value pre
 and post business combination closing; 

8 

Augmentation of capabilities
 surrounding capital allocation, and scaling up target technologies with utility customer base and/or solving issues related to the
 reliability of the renewable energy sources operations on the utility scale. 

Our management team, board,
and executive advisors have reached out and will continue to reach out to their global networks to articulate our potential business
combination target search parameters and commence the pursuit and diligence of prospective leads. 

We target businesses both
within the U.S. and internationally, which have scalable applications and global ambitions. The experience, maturity and judgment of
our management will guide our process. 

We will need to obtain additional
financing either to complete our initial business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public
shares upon completion of our initial business combination. We intend to acquire a business with an enterprise value significantly above
the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the placement units. Depending on the size of the transaction or the number
of public shares we become obligated to redeem, we may potentially utilize several additional financing sources, including but not limited
to the issuance of additional securities to the sellers of a target business, debt issued by banks or other lenders or the owners of the
target, a private placement to raise additional funds, or a combination of the foregoing. 

If we are unable to complete
our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate
the trust account. In addition, following our initial business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient to meet our obligations or
our working capital needs, we may need to obtain additional financing. 

Business Combination Criteria 

Our management team and members
of the board of directors share a similar, growth-oriented and value-creating investment philosophy. We employ a proactive
acquisition strategy focused on companies that have demonstrated a potential for future growth through the deployment of emerging technologies. 

We have identified the following
criteria that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. While we have used and will continue to use these
criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, including the Lifezone Business Combination, we may decide to enter
into our initial business combination with a target business that meets some but not all of these criteria and guidelines. We seek to
acquire companies that we believe will have: 

The potential to have a
 market capitalization of above 1 billion post the initial business combination closing; 

Attractive risk-adjusted returns
 for our warrant holders and shareholders; 

Sustainable solutions that
 have a strong environmental, social, governance component and enable carbon emission reduction/de-carbonization; 

A business model with positive
 environmental and social impact, taking into account stakeholders, employees and the community, without sacrificing a financial return
 for our shareholders; 

A company that would benefit
 from our management team s operating expertise, technical expertise, structuring expertise, extensive network, insight and
 capital markets expertise in energy transition; 

The capability of taking
 advantage of paradigm shifts created by growth of renewable generation in power generation mix and resulting power market dislocations
 through the use of disruptive technologies; 

Substantial growth potential
 post the initial business combination closing; 

9 

Leading positions and barriers
 of entry within the targeted industries that exhibit strong fundamentals; 

Qualifications to be public
 companies and to benefit from having a public currency in order to enhance their ability to pursue accretive acquisitions, high-return capital
 projects, and/or strengthen their balance sheet; 

The ability to capitalize
 on unique or specialized technologies or business platforms; and 

Value that has been discounted
 or disregarded by the marketplace. 

While we use these criteria
in evaluating business combination opportunities, we may decide to enter into a business combination with a target business or businesses
that meets some but not all of these proposed criteria. These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to
the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines, as well as
other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. If we do not complete the Lifezone Business Combination
and if we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that meets some but not all of the above criteria
and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related
to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Report, would be in the form of tender-offer documents or proxy
solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC. 

Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 

General 

We are not presently engaged
in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we consummate our initial business combination. We will effectuate our initial business
combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement, our equity, debt or a combination
of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. 

If we pay for our initial
business combination using shares or debt securities, or we do not use all of the funds released from the trust account for payment of
the purchase price in connection with our business combination or for redemptions or purchases of our ordinary shares, we may apply the
balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations
of acquired businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination,
to fund the purchase of other businesses or assets or for working capital. 

Although our management will
assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, including LHL, we cannot assure you that this assessment
will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our
control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. 

We originally had up to 15
months from the closing of our initial public offering, or until January 25, 2022, to consummate an initial business combination. However,
our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we may, by resolution of our board if requested by our sponsor,
extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to two times, each by an additional three months (for a total of up
to 21 months, or until July 25, 2023, to complete a business combination), subject to the sponsor (or its affiliates or designees)
depositing into the trust account, on or prior to the applicable deadline, additional funds of 2,760,000, for each of the available
three-month extensions, for a total payment of up to 5,520,000. Any such payments would be made in the form of non-interest bearing
loans. If we complete our initial business combination, we will, at the option of our sponsor, repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds
of the trust account released to us or convert a portion or all of the total loan amount into units at a price of 10.00 per unit, which
units will be identical to the placement units. If we do not complete a business combination, we will repay such loans only from funds
held outside of the trust account, if any such funds are available. We currently believe we will not have sufficient funds left outside
of the trust account to pay back such loans if our initial business combination is not completed. Our shareholders will not be entitled
to vote or redeem their shares in connection with any such extension. However, our shareholders will be entitled to vote and redeem their
shares in connection with a shareholder meeting held to approve an initial business combination or in a tender offer undertaken in connection
with such an initial business combination if we propose such a business combination during any three-month extension period. 

In the event that we receive
notice from our sponsor five days prior to the deadline of its wish for us to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release
announcing such intention at least three days prior to the deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the
deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our sponsor and its affiliates or permitted designees are not
obligated to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. If we complete our initial business combination, we
would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. 

10 

On January 18, 2023, our
sponsor requested that we extend the date by which we must consummate an initial business combination from January 25, 2023 to April
25, 2023. In connection with the Extension, on January 19, 2023, we issued the Extension Note in the principal amount of 2,760,000 to
our sponsor. Also on January 19, 2023, our sponsor deposited the Extension Payment of 2,760,000 (representing 0.10 per public share)
into the trust account. This deposit enabled the Company to implement the Extension. The Extension is the first of two three-month extensions
permitted under the Company s governing documents as described above. 

If we are unable to consummate
an initial business combination by April 25, 2023 (or July 25, 2023 if we fully extend the period of time to consummate our initial business
combination in accordance with the terms described in this Report), we will redeem 100 of the outstanding public shares for a pro rata
portion of the funds held in the trust account, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares,
subject to applicable law and as further described herein, and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. We expect that the pro rata redemption
price to be approximately 10.35 per share as of December 31, 2022 (excluding .10 per share as a result of the extension payment) and
such amount may be increased by 0.10 per public share for an additional three-month extension of our time to consummate our initial
business combination, as described in this Report, without taking into account any interest earned on such funds. However, we cannot assure
you that we will in fact be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims
of our public shareholders. 

The NYSE rules require that
our initial business combination be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80 of
the net assets held in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time
that we sign definitive agreements in connection with our initial business combination. However, if our securities are not listed on
the NYSE or another securities exchange, we will no longer be subject to that requirement. 

We may seek to raise additional
funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities to finance our initial business combination, and we may effectuate an initial
business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance
with applicable securities laws, we would consummate such financing only simultaneously with the consummation of our business combination.
In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or
proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by applicable law
or the NYSE, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. 

There are no prohibitions
on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. 

For more information regarding
the shares to be sold in connection with the Lifezone Business Combination, please see Lifezone Business Combination above. 

Sources of Acquisition Candidates 

Target business candidates
may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, venture capital
funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds, brokers and other members of the financial community and
corporate executives. These target candidates may present solicited or unsolicited proposals. We have expected and continue to expect
such sources to become aware that we are seeking a business combination candidate by a variety of means, including publicly available
information relating to our initial public offering, public relations and marketing efforts or direct contact by management following
the completion of our initial public offering. 

Our officers and directors,
as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates of which they become aware through their contacts.
We may engage the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions, in which event we may
pay a finder s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm s length negotiation based on the terms
of the transaction. We will engage a finder only if our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us
that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management
determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which
case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will we pay our sponsor, officers, directors,
or executive advisors or any entities with which they are affiliated, any finder s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior
to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type
of transaction that it is); our officers, directors and executive advisors will have an economic interest in securities held by our sponsor.
However, the following payments are made to our sponsor, officers, directors, executive advisors, or our or their affiliates: (i) repayment
of loans that our sponsor, members of our management team, executive advisors or any of their respective affiliates or other third parties
may make to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination (provided that if we do not consummate
an initial business combination, we may use working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds
from our trust account would be used for such repayment), (ii) payments to our sponsor or its affiliate of a total of 10,000 per
month for office space, administrative and support services, and (iii) reimbursements for any out-of-pocket expenses related
to identifying, investigation and completing an initial business combination. Although some of our officers and directors may enter into
employment or consulting agreements with the acquired business following our initial business combination, the presence or absence of
any such arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate. 

11 

We are not prohibited from
pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates.
Additionally, we are not prohibited from partnering, submitting joint bids, or entering into any similar transaction with such persons
in the pursuit of an initial business combination. While LHL is not affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, in the event we
do not consummate the Lifezone Business Combination and we seek to complete an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated
with our sponsor, officers or directors, or we partner with such persons in our pursuit of an initial business combination, we, or a committee
of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm, that
such an initial business combination is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view. Generally, such opinion is rendered to
a company s board of directors and investment banking firms may take the view that shareholders may not rely on the opinion. Such
view will not impact our decision on which investment banking firm to hire. 

Unless we consummate our
initial business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain a financial fairness opinion from an independent
investment banking firm. If we do not obtain such an opinion, our shareholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors,
who will determine fair market value and fairness based on standards generally accepted by the financial community. The application of
such standards would involve a comparison, from a valuation standpoint, of our business combination target to comparable public companies,
as applicable, and a comparison of our contemplated transaction with such business combination target to other then-recently announced
comparable private and public company transactions, as applicable. The application of such standards and the basis of our board of directors 
determination will be discussed and disclosed in our tender offer or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, related to our initial
business combination. 

Other Acquisition Considerations 

Members of our management
team directly or indirectly own our ordinary shares and/or placement units, and, accordingly, have a conflict of interest in determining
whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each
of our officers and directors will have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention
or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our
initial business combination. 

Each of our directors and
officers presently has, and in the future any of our directors and our officers may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations
to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present acquisition opportunities to such entity.
Accordingly, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an
acquisition opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he
or she will need to honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such acquisition opportunity to such entity, and
only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide
that, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered
to any officer or director unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or
officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable
for us to pursue. We do not believe, however, that any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our directors or officers would
materially undermine our ability to complete our business combination. 

In addition, our sponsor,
officers and directors may participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company prior
to completion of our initial business combination. As a result, our sponsor, officers or directors could have conflicts of interest in
determining whether to present business combination opportunities to us or to any other blank check company with which they may become
involved. Although we have no formal policy in place for vetting potential conflicts of interest, our board of directors will review
any potential conflicts of interest on a case-by-case basis. 

Initial Business Combination 

The NYSE rules require that
our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value equal to
at least 80 of the net assets held in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned)
at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not
able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent
investment banking firm or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions for the type of company we are seeking to
acquire or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses
in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. 

12 

We anticipate structuring
our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire
100 of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination
such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100 of such interests or assets of the target business in order
to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business
combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise
acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50 or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders
prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations
ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a
substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In
this case, we would acquire a 100 controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of
new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares
subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100 of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses
are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what
will be valued for purposes of the 80 of net assets test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business,
the 80 of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. Based on the valuation analysis of our
management and board of directors, we have determined that the fair market value of LHL was substantially in excess of 80 of the funds
in the trust account and that the 80 test was therefore satisfied. 

We have filed a Registration
Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result,
we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15
to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business
combination. 

Status as a Public Company 

We believe our structure as
a public company makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses, such as LHL. As an existing public company,
we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In
this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares or other equity interests in the target business for our
shares or for a combination of our shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. See
 Lifezone Business Combination above for more information about such share exchange in the Lifezone Business Combination.
Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method
a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public
offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same
extent in connection with a business combination with us. 

Furthermore, once a proposed
business combination is completed, such as the Lifezone Business Combination, the target business will have effectively become public,
whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters ability to complete the offering, as well as general
market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have
greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders interests. It
can offer further benefits by augmenting a company s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented
employees. 

While we believe that our
structure and our management team s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may
have a negative view of us since we are a blank check company, without an operating history, and there is uncertainty relating to our
ability to obtain shareholder approval of our proposed initial business combination and retain sufficient funds in our trust account
in connection therewith. 

We are an emerging
growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day
of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, or October 25, 2026, (b) in
which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated
filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the end
of the second fiscal quarter of such fiscal year, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt
securities during the prior three-year period. 

Additionally, we are a smaller
reporting company as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain
reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain
a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds
 250 million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter of such fiscal year, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded 100 million
during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as
of the end of the second fiscal quarter of such fiscal year. 

13 

Financial Position 

With funds available for a
business combination in the amount of 285,650,505 as of December 31, 2022 before fees and expenses associated with our initial business
combination, we offer a target business such as a LHL a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing
capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because
we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing,
we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target
business to fit its needs and desires. 

See Lifezone Business
Combination above for more information on the financing in the Lifezone Business Combination. 

Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 

We are not presently engaged
in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we consummate our initial public combination. We will effectuate our initial business
combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the placement units, our shares,
debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may, although we do not currently
intend to, seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early
stages of development or growth, start-up companies or companies with speculative business plans or excess leverage, which would
subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 

If our initial business combination
is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration
in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance
of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations
of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other businesses or assets or for working capital. 

We may seek to raise additional
funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination,
and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the
trust account. 

In the case of an initial
business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing
the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by applicable law or stock exchange listing
requirements, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately
or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. 

For more information regarding
the financing of the Lifezone Business Combination and the related agreements, please see Lifezone Business Combination 
above. 

Selection of a Target Business and Structuring
of Our Initial Business Combination 

The NYSE rules require that
our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value equal to
at least 80 of the net assets held in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned)
at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of the target
or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community,
such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. Our shareholders will be relying on the business judgment of
our board of directors, which will have significant discretion in choosing the standard used to establish the fair market value of the
target or targets, and different methods of valuation may vary greatly in outcome from one another. Such standards used will be disclosed
in our tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, related to our initial business combination. 

If our board is not able
to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent
investment banking firm or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions for the type of company we are seeking to
acquire or an independent accounting firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses
in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually
unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to
effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. 

14 

In any case, we will only
complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or
otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under
the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100 of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses,
the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for
purposes of the 80 of net assets test. 

To the extent we effect our
initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth
we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks
inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 

In evaluating a prospective
target business, such as LHL, we conduct a thorough due diligence review which encompasses, among other things, meetings with incumbent
management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information
which will be made available to us. 

Any costs incurred with respect
to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed
will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 

Lack of Business Diversification 

For an indefinite period
of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance
of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or
several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in
a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

subject us to negative
 economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry
 in which we operate after our initial business combination; and 

cause us to depend on the
 marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target s
Management Team 

Although we closely scrutinize
the management of a prospective target business, including the management of LHL, when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial
business combination with that business and plan to continue to do so if the Lifezone Business Combination is not consummated and we seek
other business combination opportunities, our assessment of the target business s management may not prove to be correct. In addition,
the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future
role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. Michael Sedoy, CFO
of GoGreen Investments Corp will become Interim CFO of LifeZone Metals. John Dowd, CEO and Govind Friedland, COO of GoGreen Investments
Corp will join LifeZone Metals Board. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with
us following our initial business combination, including the Lifezone Business Combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote
their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. 

We cannot assure you that
any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether
any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. 

Following a business combination,
we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we
will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that such additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience
necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 

15 

Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve
Our Initial Business Combination 

We may conduct redemptions
without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange rule (as
is the case in the Lifezone Business Combination), or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons. 

Under the NYSE s listing
rules, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example: 

we issue ordinary shares
 that will be equal to or in excess of 20 of the number of Class A ordinary shares then outstanding (other than in a public
 offering); 

any of our directors, officers
 or substantial shareholders (as defined by NYSE rules) has a 5 or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10 or greater
 interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance
 of ordinary shares could result in an increase in issued and outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 5 or more; or 

the issuance or potential
 issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control. 

See Lifezone Business
Combination above for more information regarding the requisite approvals needed in the Lifezone Business Combination. 

Permitted Purchases of Our Securities 

In the event we seek shareholder
approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant
to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions
or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number
of shares such persons may purchase, subject to compliance with applicable law and NYSE rules. However, they have no current commitments,
plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. In the
event our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates determine to make any such purchases at the time of a shareholder vote relating
to our initial business combination, such purchases could have the effect of influencing the vote necessary to approve such transaction.
None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares in such transactions. They will not make any such purchases when
they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by
Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still
the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights.
We have adopted an insider trading policy which will require insiders to: (i) refrain from purchasing shares during certain blackout
periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information and (ii) to clear all trades with our legal
counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan,
as it will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such
circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is
not necessary. 

In the event that our sponsor,
directors, officers or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already
elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their
shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules
under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if
the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with
such rules. 

The purpose of such purchases
would be to (i) reduce the number of public shares outstanding or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with
a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination,
where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our initial business combination
that may not otherwise have been possible. 

In addition, if such purchases
are made, the public float of our ordinary shares may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities
may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities
exchange. 

16 

Our sponsor, officers, directors
and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates
may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests
submitted by shareholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent
that our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential
selling shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against
the business combination. Such persons would select the shareholders from whom to acquire shares based on the number of shares available,
the negotiated price per share and such other factors as any such person may deem relevant at the time of purchase. The price per share
paid in any such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public shareholder would receive if it elected to redeem its
shares in connection with our initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates will only purchase shares
if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. Any public shares purchased
by our sponsor or our directors, officers or advisors, or their respective affiliates in privately negotiated transactions will not (i)
be purchased at a price higher than the price offered through the redemption process, (ii) be voted in favor of the initial business
combination or (iii) have redemption rights, and if such public shares do have redemption rights then such rights will be waived by our
sponsor or our directors, officers or advisors, or their respective affiliates. 

Any purchases by our sponsor,
officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only
be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for
manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements
that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their
affiliates will not make purchases of ordinary shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of
the Exchange Act. 

Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders
Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination 

We will provide our public shareholders
with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination, such
as the Lifezone Business Combination, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the
trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (which
interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described
herein. As of December 31, 2022, the amount in the trust account was approximately 10.35 per share (excluding .10 per share as a result
of the extension payment) and such amount may be increased by 0.10 per share if we extend the time we have to consummate our initial
business combination by an additional three months, as described in this Report. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors
who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption
rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Our sponsor,
officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights
with respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with (i) the completion of our initial business
combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association
(A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right
to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not
complete our initial business combination by April 25, 2023 (or July 25, 2023 if we fully extend the period of time to consummate our
initial business combination in accordance with the terms described in this Report) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating
to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares. 

Manner of Conducting Redemptions 

We will provide our public
shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial
business combination, including the Lifezone Business Combination, either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve
the business combination (as is the case in the Lifezone Business Combination) or (ii) if the Lifezone Business Combination is not
consummated, by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination
or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing
of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under the law or stock exchange
listing requirement. Under the NYSE rules, asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while
direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20 of our issued and outstanding
ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would require shareholder approval.
We intend to conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless shareholder approval
is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements or we choose to seek shareholder approval for business or other
legal reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on the NYSE, we will be required to comply with the NYSE
rules. 

If a shareholder vote is
not required and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and
restated memorandum and articles of association: 

conduct the redemptions
 pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and 

17 

file tender offer documents
 with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information
 about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which
 regulates the solicitation of proxies. 

Upon the public announcement
of our initial business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to
purchase our Class A ordinary shares in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply
with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 

In the event we conduct redemptions
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a)
under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender
offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than a specified number of
public shares which are not purchased by our sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we will only redeem our public
shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least 5,000,001 either prior to or upon consummation of
our initial business combination, after payment of the deferred underwriting commission (so that we are not subject to the SEC s
 penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating
to our initial business combination. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the
tender offer and not complete the initial business combination. 

If, however, shareholder
approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval
for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association: 

conduct the redemptions
 in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of
 proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and 

file proxy materials with
 the SEC. 

We expect that a final proxy
statement would be mailed to public shareholders at least 10 days prior to the shareholder vote. However, we expect that a draft
proxy statement would be made available to such shareholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption
if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply
with the substantive and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A in connection with any shareholder vote even if we are not able
to maintain our NYSE listing or Exchange Act registration. 

In the event that we seek
shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our
public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination. 

If we seek shareholder approval,
we will complete our initial business combination only if we receive the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law,
which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company. In such
case, pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement entered into with us, our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed (and their permitted
transferees will agree) to vote any founder shares held by them and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering
in favor of our initial business combination. We expect that at the time of any shareholder vote relating to our initial business combination,
our sponsor and its permitted transferees will own approximately 22.98 of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares entitled to vote
thereon. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed
transaction. In addition, our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have
agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of a
business combination. 

Our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association provide that we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net
tangible assets will be at least 5,000,001 either prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination, after payment of
the deferred underwriting commission (so that we are not subject to the SEC s penny stock rules). Redemptions of
our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our
initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the
target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the
retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate
cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any
amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of
cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted
for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 

See Lifezone Business
Combination above for more information regarding the requisite approvals needed for the Lifezone Business Combination.

Limitation on Redemption Upon Completion of
Our Initial Business Combination if We Seek Shareholder Approval 

Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial
business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that
a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert
or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights
with respect to Excess Shares (as defined below). We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks
of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business
combination as a means to force us or our sponsor or its affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market
price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15 of the shares
sold in our initial public offering Excess Shares could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder s
shares are not purchased by us or our sponsor or its affiliates at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable
terms. By limiting our shareholders ability to redeem no more than 15 of the shares sold in our initial public offering, we believe
we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business
combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a
minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders ability to vote all of their
shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers and directors have, pursuant
to a letter agreement entered into with us, waived their right to have any founder shares or public shares held by them redeemed in connection
with (i) our initial business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A
ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our
public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by April 25, 2023 (or by July 25, 2023 if we fully extend the period
of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms described in this Report) or (B) with respect
to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares. Unless any of our other affiliates acquires
founder shares through a permitted transfer from an initial holder, and thereby becomes subject to the letter agreement, no such affiliate
is subject to this waiver. However, to the extent any such affiliate acquires public shares in our initial public offering or thereafter
through open market purchases, it would be a public shareholder and restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to any Excess
Shares. 

See Lifezone Business
Combination above for more information regarding the requisite approvals needed for the Lifezone Business Combination. 

Tendering Share Certificates in Connection
With a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights 

We may require our public
shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, 
to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents, or up to
two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or
to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the DWAC System, rather than simply voting against the initial business
combination. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with
our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public shareholders to satisfy such delivery requirements, which
will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public
shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two
days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes
to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Pursuant to the tender offer rules, the tender offer period will be not less than 20 business
days and, in the case of a shareholder vote, a final proxy statement would be mailed to public shareholders at least 10 days prior
to the shareholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such shareholders well in advance
of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Given the
relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 

There is a nominal cost associated
with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System.
The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker 100.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost
on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption
rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of
when such delivery must be effectuated. 

19 

The foregoing is different
from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations,
many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders vote on an initial business combination, and
a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking
to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to
arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an option
window after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company s
shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before
actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were
aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become option rights surviving past the completion of the
business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior
to the general meeting ensures that a redeeming holder s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved. 

Any request to redeem such
shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the general meeting
set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with
an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder
may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to
be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our
initial business combination. 

If our initial business combination
is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be
entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates
delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 

If the Lifezone Business
Combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until April 25, 2023
(or July 25, 2023 if we fully extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms described
in this Report). 

Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation
if no Initial Business Combination 

Our sponsor, officers and
directors have agreed that we will have until April 25, 2023 (or July 25, 2023 if we fully extend the period of time to consummate our
initial business combination in accordance with the terms described in this Report) to complete our initial business combination. If
we are unable to complete the Lifezone Business Combination or another initial business combination by April 25, 2023 (or July 25, 2023
if we fully extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms described in this Report),
we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more
than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount
then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses (which interest
shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public
shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable
law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders
and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims
of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect
to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination by April 25, 2023 (or July 25, 2023
if we fully extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms described in this Report). 

Our sponsor, officers and
directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions
from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by April 25, 2023
(or by July 25, 2023 if we fully extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms
described in this Report). However, if our sponsor, officers or directors acquire public shares after our initial public offering, they
will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination by April 25, 2023 (or July 25, 2023 if we fully extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination
in accordance with the terms described in this Report). 

Our sponsor, officers and
directors have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association that would (i) modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our
Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem
100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by April 25, 2023 (or by July 25, 2023 if we fully extend
the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms described in this Report) or (ii) with
respect to the other provisions relating to shareholders rights or pre-business combination activity, unless we provide our
public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price,
payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net
of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we will only redeem our public shares so long as
(after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least 5,000,001 either prior to or upon consummation of our initial business
combination, after payment of the deferred underwriting commission (so that we are not subject to the SEC s penny stock 
rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy
the net tangible asset requirement (described above), we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public
shares. 

20 

If we do not consummate our
initial business combination by the deadline set forth in our amended and rested memorandum and articles of association, we expect that
all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from
amounts remaining out of the 18,810 of proceeds held outside the trust account as of December 31, 2022, although we cannot assure you
that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated
with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay
taxes, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to 100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs
and expenses. 

If we were to expend all of the
net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the placement units, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account,
and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders
upon our dissolution would be approximately 10.35 as of December 31, 2022 (excluding .10 per share as a result of the extension payment).
The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority
than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders
will not be substantially less than 10.35 (excluding .10 per share as a result of the extension payment). While we intend to pay such
amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors claims. 

Although we will seek to have
all third parties (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute
agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit
of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that
they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary
responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain
an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to
execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives
available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such
third party s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where
we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise
or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or
in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such
entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or
agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we are
unable to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection
with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may
be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the
extent any claims by a third-party (other than our independent auditors) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective
target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to
below (i) 10.35 per public share as of December 31, 2022 (excluding .10 per share as a result of the extension payment) or (ii) such
lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in
value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by
a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity
of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the
event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent
of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy
their indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor s only assets are securities of our company. None of our other officers
will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 

In the event that the proceeds
in the trust account are reduced below (i) 10.35 per public share (excluding .10 per share as a result of the extension payment) or
(ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to
reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor
asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular
claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations.
While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification
obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any
particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption
price will not be substantially less than 10.35 per share (excluding .10 per share as a result of the extension payment). 

21 

We seek to reduce the possibility
that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all third parties (other
than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us
waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable
as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the Securities Act. In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities
is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. As of December
31, 2022, the amount held outside of the trust account was 18,810. 

If we file a bankruptcy or insolvency
petition or an involuntary bankruptcy insolvency petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account
could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties
with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you
we will be able to return 10.35 per share (excluding .10 per share as a result of the extension payment) to our public shareholders.
Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy insolvency petition or an involuntary bankruptcy insolvency petition is filed against us that is
not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either
a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy insolvency court could seek
to recover all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our
creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public
shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought
against us for these reasons. 

Our public shareholders will
be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial business combination,
(ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association to (A) modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A
ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our
public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by April 25, 2023 (or by July 25, 2023 if we fully extend the period
of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms described in this Report) or (B) with respect
to any other provision relating to shareholders rights or pre-business combination activity and (iii) the redemption
of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination by April 25, 2023 (or by July 25, 2023 if we
fully extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms described in this Report),
subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.
In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder s voting in connection
with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share
of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. 

Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles
of Association 

Our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association contain certain requirements and restrictions relating to our initial public offering that will
apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association relating to shareholders rights or pre-business combination activity, we will provide
dissenting public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with any such vote. Our sponsor, officers
and directors have agreed to waive any redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the
completion of our initial business combination. Specifically, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide,
among other things, that: 

prior to the consummation
 of our initial business combination, we shall either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at a
 general meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for
 or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account,
 including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our public shareholders with the opportunity
 to tender their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to
 their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net
 of taxes payable) in each case subject to the limitations described herein; 

22 

we will consummate our
 initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least 5,000,001 either prior to or upon such consummation
 and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, we receive the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires
 the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company; 

if our initial business
 combination is not consummated by April 25, 2023 (or by July 25, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business
 combination in accordance with the terms described in this Report), then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all
 amounts in the trust account; and 

prior to our initial business
 combination, we may not issue additional ordinary shares that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the
 trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination. 

These provisions cannot be
amended without the approval of a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the approval of holders of at least two-thirds of
our ordinary shares who attend and vote in a general meeting. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial
business combination, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we may consummate our initial business
combination only if approved by an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of
the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company. 

Competition 

In identifying, evaluating
and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, such as LHL, we have encountered and may continue to encounter intense
competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups
and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have
extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors
possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses is limited by
our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business.
Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the
resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially
represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. This may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business
combination with a target business. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial
business combination. 

Conflicts of Interest 

Each of our officers and
directors presently has, and in the future any of our directors and our officers may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations
to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present acquisition opportunities to such entity.
Accordingly, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an
acquisition opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he
or she will need to honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such acquisition opportunity to such entity, and
only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide
that, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered
to any officer or director unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or
officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable
for us to pursue. We do not believe, however, that any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our directors or officers would
materially undermine our ability to complete our business combination. 

Indemnity 

Our sponsor has agreed that it
will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third-party (other than our independent auditors) for services rendered
or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the
amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) 10.35 per public share (excluding .10 per share as a result of the extension payment)
or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due
to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any
claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under
our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities
Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible
to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds
to satisfy their indemnity obligations and believe our sponsor s only assets are securities of our company. We have not asked our
sponsor to reserve for such obligations. 

23 

Employees 

We currently have six officers.
Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their
time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that our officers
or any other members of our management team devotes in any time period varies based on the stage of the business combination process
we are in. 

Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 

Our units, Class A ordinary
shares, and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act, and as a result, we have reporting obligations, including the requirement
that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual
reports, including this Report, contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public auditors. 

We will provide shareholders
with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials
sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance
with, or be reconciled to, GAAP or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be
audited in accordance with the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may
acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal
proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. While this may limit the pool of potential
acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 

We are required to evaluate
our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in
the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures
audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal
controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase
the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. 

We have filed a Registration
Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result,
we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15
to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business
combination. 

We are an emerging
growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to
take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging
growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements,
and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of
any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be
a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 

In addition, Section 107
of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided
in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging
growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 

We will remain an emerging
growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion
of our initial public offering, or October 25, 2026, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion,
or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that is held
by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter of such fiscal year, and (2) the date
on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
References herein to emerging growth company shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act. 

Exempted companies are Cayman
Islands companies wishing to conduct business outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions
of the Companies Law. As an exempted company, we have applied for and have received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands
government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of
20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits,
income, gains or appreciations shall apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains
or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall be payable (1) on or in respect of our shares,
debentures or other obligations or (2) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution
of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation
of us.

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

As a smaller reporting company
under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include risk factors in this Report. However, below is a partial list of
material risks, uncertainties and other factors that could have a material effect on the Company and its operations: 

we are a blank check company
 with no revenue or basis to evaluate our ability to select a suitable business target; 

we may not be able to select
 an appropriate target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination in the prescribed time frame; 

our expectations around the performance of a prospective target business, such as LHL, or businesses may not be realized; 

we may not be successful
 in retaining or recruiting required officers, key employees or directors following our initial business combination; 

our officers and directors
 may have difficulties allocating their time between the Company and other businesses and may potentially have conflicts of interest
 with our business or in approving our initial business combination; 

we may not be able to obtain
 additional financing to complete our initial business combination or reduce the number of shareholders requesting redemption; 

we may issue our shares
 to investors in connection with our initial business combination at a price that is less than the prevailing market price of our
 shares at that time; 

you may not be given the
 opportunity to choose the initial business target or to vote on the initial business combination; 

trust account funds may
 not be protected against third party claims or bankruptcy; 

an active market for our
 public securities may not develop and you will have limited liquidity and trading; 

the availability to us
 of funds from interest income on the trust account balance may be insufficient to operate our business prior to our initial business
 combination; 

our financial performance
 following a business combination with an entity may be negatively affected by their lack an established record of revenue, cash
 flows and experienced management; 

there may be more competition
 to find an attractive target for an initial business combination, which could increase the costs associated with completing our initial
 business combination; 

changes in the market for
 directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an initial
 business combination; 

If we do not complete the
 Lifezone Business Combination, we may attempt to simultaneously complete business combinations with multiple prospective targets,
 which may hinder our ability to complete our initial business combination and give rise to increased costs and risks that could negatively
 impact our operations and profitability; 

we may engage one or more
 of our underwriters or one of their respective affiliates to provide additional services to us after the initial public offering,
 which may include acting as a financial advisor in connection with an initial business combination or as placement agent in connection
 with a related financing transaction. Our underwriters are entitled to receive deferred underwriting commissions that will be released
 from the trust account only upon a completion of an initial business combination. These financial incentives may cause them to have
 potential conflicts of interest in rendering any such additional services to us after the initial public offering, including, for
 example, in connection with the sourcing and consummation of an initial business combination; 

25 

we are attempting to complete our initial business combination with LHL, a private company about which little information is available, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all; 

our warrants are accounted
 for as derivative liabilities and are recorded at fair value upon issuance with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings,
 which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our ordinary shares or may make it more difficult for us to consummate an
 initial business combination; 

since our initial shareholders
 will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed (other than with respect to any public
 shares they may acquire during or after the initial public offering), and because our sponsor, officers and directors may profit
 substantially even under circumstances in which our public shareholders would experience losses in connection with their investment,
 a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business
 combination; 

changes in laws or regulations or how such laws or regulations are
 interpreted or applied, or a failure to comply with any laws or regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability
 to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations; 

the value of the founder shares following completion of our initial business combination is likely to be substantially higher than the nominal price paid for them, even if the trading price of our ordinary shares at such time is substantially less than 10.35 per share (excluding .10 per share as a result of the extension payment); 

resources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we have not completed our initial business combination within the Combination Period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately 10.35 per share (excluding .10 per share as a result of the extension payment), or less than such amount in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless; 

in March 2022, the SEC issued proposed rules relating to certain activities
 of SPACs. Certain of the procedures that we, a potential business combination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection
 with such proposals may increase our costs and the time needed to complete our initial business combination and may constrain the
 circumstances under which we could complete an initial business combination. The need for compliance with such proposals may cause
 us to liquidate the funds in the trust account or liquidate the Company at an earlier time than we might otherwise choose; 

if we are deemed to be
 an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we would be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements
 and our activities would be severely restricted. As a result, in such circumstances, unless we are able to modify our activities
 so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we may abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and
 instead liquidate the Company; 

to mitigate the risk that
 we might be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we may, at any time, instruct the trustee
 to liquidate the investments held in the trust account and instead to hold the funds in the trust account in an interest
 bearing demand deposit account until the earlier of the consummation of our initial business combination or our liquidation.
 As a result, following the liquidation of investments in the trust account, we would likely receive less interest on the
 funds held in the trust account, which would likely reduce the dollar amount our public shareholders would receive upon any redemption
 or liquidation of the Company; 

we may not be able to complete
 an initial business combination with certain potential target companies if a proposed transaction with the target company may be
 subject to review or approval by regulatory authorities pursuant to certain U.S. or foreign laws or regulations, including the Committee
 on Foreign Investment in the United States; 

recent increases in inflation
 and interest rates in the United States and elsewhere could make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination; 

military conflict in Ukraine
or elsewhere may lead to increased price volatility for publicly traded securities, which could make it more difficult for us to consummate
an initial business combination; 

there is substantial doubt
 about our ability to continue as a going concern 

26 

significant decline in
 electrification metals pricing driven by slowdown or reversal of energy transition; and 

We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. If we are unable to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may affect investor confidence in us and materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. We are in the process of implementing a number of measures to address this material weakness, however, we cannot assure you that these measures will fully address the material weakness and deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting or that we may conclude that they have been fully remediated. 

For the complete list of
risks relating to our operations, see the section titled Risk Factors contained in (i) our IPO Registration Statement and
(ii) our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022, as filed
with the SEC on May 12, 2022, August 12, 2022 and November 10, 2022, respectively. Any of these factors could result in a significant
or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risks could arise that may also affect our
business or ability to consummate an initial business combination. We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose additional
risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 

For risks relating to LHL and the Lifezone Business Combination, please
see the Lifezone Registration Statement once filed.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements 

All
statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Report including, without limitation, statements in this section
regarding our financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward- looking
statements. When used in this Report, words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, 
 intend and similar expressions, as they relate to us or our management, identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking
statements are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management.
Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors detailed
in our filings with the SEC. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf
are qualified in their entirety by this paragraph. 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report. 

Overview 

We are a blank check company
incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company and incorporated for the purpose of effecting a business combination. We have not selected
any specific business combination target. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our
initial public offering and the private placement of the placement units, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt. 

The issuance of additional
ordinary shares in a business combination: 

may significantly dilute
 the equity interest of investors, which dilution would increase if the anti-dilution provisions in the Class B ordinary
 shares resulted in the issuance of Class A ordinary shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class B
 ordinary shares; 

may subordinate the rights
 of holders of ordinary shares if preference shares are issued with rights senior to those afforded our ordinary shares; 

could cause a change of
 control if a substantial number of our ordinary shares are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net
 operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; 

may have the effect of
 delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the share ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control
 of us; and 

may adversely affect prevailing
 market prices for our Class A ordinary shares and/or warrants. 

Similarly, if we issue debt securities,
it could result in: 

default and foreclosure
 on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations; 

acceleration of our obligations
 to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require
 the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; 

our immediate payment of
 all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; 

29 

our inability to obtain
 necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the
 debt security is outstanding; 

our inability to pay dividends
 on our ordinary shares; 

using a substantial portion
 of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our ordinary shares
 if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; 

limitations on our flexibility
 in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; 

increased vulnerability
 to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and 

limitations on our ability
 to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy
 and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt. 

As indicated in the accompanying
financial statements, at December 31, 2022 we had 18,810 in cash held outside of our trust account. Further, we expect to continue to
incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete our initial business
combination will be successful. 

Recent Developments 

On December 13, 2022, the
Company, Lifezone Metals, our sponsor, Merger Sub, LHL, the LHL Shareholders Representative and the LHL Shareholders entered into the
Lifezone Business Combination Agreement, pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions precedent in
the Lifezone Business Combination Agreement, the following transactions will occur: (a) the merger of the Company with and into
Merger Sub, with Merger Sub surviving the merger and the security holders of the Company (other than the security holders of the Company
electing to redeem their ordinary shares or exercising their dissenters rights) becoming security holders of Lifezone Metals in
accordance with the Companies Act, (b) the automatic conversion and exchange of (i) each issued and outstanding public warrant of the
Company for the right to receive one Lifezone Metals public warrant and (ii) each issued and outstanding private warrant of the Company
(whether or not a whole warrant) into the right to receive one Lifezone Metals private warrant, (c) the acquisition by Lifezone
Metals of all of the issued and outstanding share capital of LHL from the LHL Shareholders in exchange for the issuance of Lifezone Metals
ordinary shares and, if applicable, the issuance of Earnout Shares (as defined in the Lifezone Business Combination Agreement), pursuant
to which LHL will become a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Lifezone Metals, and (d) the other transactions contemplated by the
Lifezone Business Combination Agreement and the Lifezone Ancillary Documents referred to therein. 

The LHL Transactions will be consummated
subject to the deliverables and provisions as further described in the Lifezone Business Combination Agreement. For more information
on the Lifezone Business Combination Agreement, please see Item 1. Business. 

Results of Operations and Known Trends or Future Events 

All activity through October
25, 2021, relates to our formation and the initial public offering. Since the initial public offering, our activities have been limited
to the evaluation of business combination candidates. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable
securities held in the trust account. We are incurring expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting,
accounting and auditing compliance), as well as expenses as we conduct due diligence on prospective business combinations 

For the year ended December
31, 2022, we had a net loss of 1,271,060, which consists of operating costs of 5,397,402 partially offset by 4,126,342 of interest
income. 

30 

Liquidity, Capital Resources, and Going Concern 

Until the consummation of
the Initial Public Offering, our only sources of liquidity were an initial purchase of founder shares of 25,000 by the Sponsor, and
a total of 375,000 from our Sponsor under an unsecured promissory note which was repaid in full on October 25, 2021. 

On October 25, 2021, we
consummated our Initial Public Offering in which we sold 27,600,000 Units at a price of 10.00 per unit generating gross proceeds of
 276,000,000 before underwriting fees and expenses. Our Sponsor purchased 1,335,000 Placement Units at a price of 10.00 per unit generating
 13,350,000 in a private placement that occurred simultaneously with the Initial Public Offering. 

In connection with the Initial
Public Offering, we incurred offering costs of 15,817,581 (including an underwriting fee of 5,520,000 and deferred underwriting commissions
of 9,660,000). Other incurred offering costs consisted principally of preparation fees related to the Initial Public Offering. A total
of 281,520,000 10.20 per unit sold in the Initial Public Offering) of the net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the private
placement were deposited in the Trust Account established for the benefit of our public shareholders. 

As of December 31, 2022,
we have available to us 18,810 of cash on our balance sheet. We will use these funds, and additional funds received from our Sponsor
in the form of working capital loans, primarily to evaluate target businesses, perform business, legal, and accounting due diligence
on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their
representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate
and complete a Business Combination. 

In order to fund working capital
deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of
our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our
initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we
may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account
would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units at a price of 10.00 per unit at the option
of the lender at the time of the business combination. The units would be identical to the placement units sold in the private placement.
The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to
such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor, members of our management team or any of their affiliates
as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to
funds in our trust account. On June 6, 2022, we issued a Note for borrowing of up to 300,000 from our Sponsor in connection with advances
our Sponsor has made, and may make in the future, to the Company for working capital purposes. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has
 300,000 outstanding under the Note. On January 19, 2023, we issued a Working Capital Note for borrowings of up to 300,000 from our Sponsor
in connection with advances our Sponsor has made, and may make in the future, to the Company for working capital purposes. As of February
24, 2023, the Company has drawn down 200,000 under the Note. On January 18, 2023, our Sponsor requested that we extend the date by which
we must consummate an initial business combination from January 25, 2023 to April 25, 2023. In connection with the extension, on January
19, 2023, we issued the Extension Note in the principal amount of 2,760,000 to our Sponsor. Also on January 19, 2023, our Sponsor deposited
the Extension Payment of 2,760,000 (representing 0.10 per public share) into our trust account. This deposit enabled us to implement
the extension. The extension is the first of two three-month extensions permitted under our governing documents. 

Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we expect
our primary liquidity requirements during that period to include approximately 725,000 for legal, accounting, due diligence, travel and
other expenses associated with structuring, negotiating and documenting successful business combinations; 325,000 for legal and accounting
fees related to regulatory reporting requirements; 185,000 for NYSE and other regulatory fees; 180,000 for office space, administrative
and support services for up to 18 months (which may be extended to up to 21 months as described elsewhere in this Report); and
approximately 100,000 for general working capital that will be used for miscellaneous expenses and reserves net of estimated interest
income. 

These amounts are estimates
and may differ materially from our actual expenses. In addition, we could use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust to pay
commitment fees for financing, fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund
a no-shop provision (a provision designed to keep target businesses from shopping around for transactions
with other companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although
we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into an agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from
a target business, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a no-shop provision would be determined based
on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether
as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due
diligence with respect to, prospective target businesses. 

31 

We will need to raise additional
funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. Because our estimates of the costs of identifying a target
business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination were less than the actual amount necessary
to do so, we will have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial business combination. Moreover, we will
need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant
number of our public shares upon completion of our initial business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur
debt in connection with such business combination. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements; Commitments and Contractual Obligations;
Quarterly Results 

We have no obligations, assets
or liabilities that would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships
with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established
for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. 

We have not entered into
any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities,
or entered into any non-financial assets. 

At December 31, 2022, we
did not have any capital lease obligations or operating lease obligations. 

Commencing on the effective
date of the Initial Public Offering through the earlier of the our consummation of a Business Combination and its liquidation, we agreed
to pay an affiliate of our Sponsor a total of 10,000 per month for office space, administrative and support services. For the year ended
December 31, 2022, we paid a total of 120,000 under this arrangement. 

The underwriters in our
initial public offering were paid a cash underwriting fee of 2 of gross proceeds of the initial public offering or 5,520,000. In addition,
the underwriters entitled to aggregate deferred underwriting commissions of 9,660,000 consisting of 3.5 of the gross proceeds of the
initial public offering. The deferred underwriting commissions will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the trust
account solely in the event that we complete an initial business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. On
October 19, 2022, we received a waiver of a portion of the deferred fee from one of our underwriters. As a result of this waiver the
deferred fee has been reduced by 4,830,000 leaving a remaining deferred fee of 4,830,000 due at the closing of a Business Combination.
Subsequently, on January 26, 2023, the second underwriter waiver their right to the remaining deferred underwriting commissions. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial
statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires the Company s management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. The Company
has identified the following as its critical accounting policies: 

Ordinary shares subject to possible redemption 

The Company accounts for
its ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) is classified
as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that features
redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of events not solely
within the Company s control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders 
equity. The Company s ordinary shares features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company s
control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, ordinary shares subject to possible redemption is presented
at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders equity section of the Company s balance sheet. 

Income (Loss) Per Common Share 

The Company s statement
of operations includes a presentation of income (loss) per share for redeemable ordinary shares and income (loss) per share for Class
A and Class B non-redeemable shares in a manner similar to the two-class method in calculating net income (loss) per ordinary share.
Net income (loss) per ordinary share, basic and diluted, for redeemable ordinary shares is computed by dividing the pro rata net income
(loss) between the redeemable ordinary share and the non-redeemable ordinary share by the weighted average number of ordinary shares
outstanding for the period as adjusted for the effects of deemed dividend under the assumption that they represent dividends to the holders
of the redeemable ordinary shares. Net income (loss) per ordinary share, basic and diluted, for non-redeemable ordinary shares is computed
by dividing the pro rata net income (loss) between the redeemable and non-redeemable ordinary shares by the weighted average number of
ordinary shares outstanding for the period. 

32 

The calculation of diluted
income (loss) per ordinary share does not consider the effect of the warrants issued in connection with the Public Offering since the
exercise of the warrants are contingent upon the occurrence of future events. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not
have any dilutive warrants, securities or other contracts that could potentially, be exercised or converted into ordinary shares. As
a result, diluted income (loss) per ordinary share is the same as basic ordinary share for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Management does not believe
that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the
Company s financial statements. 

Factors That May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations 

Our results of operations
and our ability to complete an initial business combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could cause economic uncertainty
and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted by, among other things,
downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in interest rates, supply
chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including resurgences
and the emergence of new variants, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflict in Ukraine. We cannot at this time fully
predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact
our business and our ability to complete initial business combination. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk. 

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this Item. 

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data. 

Reference is made to pages
F-1 through F-24 comprising a portion of this Report, which are incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with
Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. 

None. 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures
are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Certifying Officers, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022 as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the Company s controls over reconciliations
for accrued expenses during the financial statement close and disclosure review process. 

Management
identified a material weakness related to the financial reporting process, which included not identifying and recording operating accruals
and expenses related to the business combination and a lack of review of the Company s financial statements at each reporting period.
As a result, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance
with GAAP. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this Annual Report present fairly in all material
respects our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. 

Management
has implemented remediation steps to improve our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over the financial reporting
process. Specifically, the Company has established a process by which all contracts and vendors are reviewed on a regular basis to determine
if any expense was incurred and properly recorded. The Company has implemented a review of equity transactions to ensure the appropriate
accounting for and valuation, as deemed necessary. The Company has also established a formal review process for its financial statements
during which the preparers of financial statements present the financial statements to a group of reviewers within the management team
with the results of such review being documented. We plan to further improve this process by implementing additional layers of reviews
in the financial close process. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance
that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. 

33 

We do not expect that our
disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter
how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls
and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,
and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures,
no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies
and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
future conditions. 

Management s Annual Report on Internal
Controls over Financial Reporting 

As
required by SEC rules and regulations implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting
purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

(1) 
 pertain to
 the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
 of our company, 

(2) 
 provide reasonable
 assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with
 GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors,
 and 

(3) 
 provide reasonable
 assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have
 a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our financial
statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making these assessments, management used
the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated
Framework (2013). Based on the assessments and those criteria, management determined that we did not maintained effective internal controls
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, Due to the amterial weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating
to controls over reconciliations for accrued expenses during the financial statement close and disclosure review process. 

Management
has implemented remediation steps to improve our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over the financial reporting
process. Specifically, the Company has established a process by which all contracts and vendors are reviewed on a regular basis to determine
if any expense was incurred and properly recorded. The Company has also establish a formal review process for its financial statements
during which the preparers of financial statements present the financial statements to a group of reviewers within the management team
with the results of such review being documented. We plan to further improve this process by implementing additional layers of reviews
in the financial close process. 

This
Report does not include an attestation report of our internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm due to
our status as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

We have commenced our remediation
efforts in connection with the identification of the material weakness discussed above and have taken the following steps during the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2022: 

- We are establishing additional monitoring and oversight controls
designed to ensure the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements and disclosures. 

Other than the changes discussed
above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that may have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

39 

Committees of the Board of Directors 

Our board of directors has
three standing committees: an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee, each comprised
of independent directors. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, the NYSE rules and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange
Act require that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors, and the NYSE rules require that
the compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee of a listed company each be comprised solely of independent
directors. Each committee operates under a charter that has been approved by our board of directors and has the compositions and responsibilities
described below. The charter of each committee is available on our website at https://www.gogreeninvestments.com/about/#govern. 

Audit Committee 

We have established an audit
committee of the board of directors. Robert Hvide Macleod, Neha Palmer and Nereida Flannery serve as members of our audit committee,
and Mr. Macleod chairs the audit committee. Under the NYSE listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at
least three members of the audit committee, all of whom must be independent. Each of Mr. Macleod, Ms. Palmer and Ms. Flannery meets
the independent director standard under the NYSE listing standards and under Rule 10-A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act. 

Each member of the audit
committee is financially literate and our board of directors has determined that Mr. Macleod as an audit committee financial
expert as defined in applicable SEC rules. 

We have adopted an audit
committee charter, which details the principal functions of the audit committee, including: 

assisting board oversight
 of (1) the integrity of our financial statements, (2) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (3) our independent
 auditor s qualifications and independence, and (4) the performance of our internal audit function and independent auditors; 

the appointment, compensation,
 retention, replacement, and oversight of the work of the independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us; 

pre-approving all
 audit and permitted non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us, and
 establishing pre-approval policies and procedures; 

setting clear hiring policies
 for employees or former employees of the independent registered public accounting firm, including but not limited to, as required
 by applicable laws and regulations; 

setting clear policies
 for audit partner rotation in compliance with applicable laws and regulations; 

obtaining and reviewing
 a report, at least annually, from the independent registered public accounting firm describing (i) the independent registered public
 accounting firm s internal quality-control procedures, (ii) any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review,
 or peer review, of the audit firm, or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities within the preceding
 five years respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the firm and any steps taken to deal with such issues and (iii)
 all relationships between the independent registered public accounting firm and us to assess the independent registered public accounting
 firm s independence; 

40 

meeting to review and discuss
 our annual audited financial statements and quarterly financial statements with management and the independent auditor, including
 reviewing our specific disclosures under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
 Operations 

reviewing and approving
 any related party transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC prior to
 us entering into such transaction; and 

reviewing with management,
 the independent registered public accounting firm, and our legal advisors, as appropriate, any legal, regulatory or compliance matters,
 including any correspondence with regulators or government agencies and any employee complaints or published reports that raise material
 issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies and any significant changes in accounting standards or rules promulgated
 by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. 

Compensation Committee 

We have established a compensation
committee of the board of directors. Livia Mahler, Neha Palmer and Greg Hill serve as members of our compensation committee. Under the
NYSE listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least two members of the compensation committee, all of whom
must be independent. Ms. Mahler, Ms. Palmer and Mr. Hill are independent, and Ms. Mahler chairs the compensation committee. 

We have adopted a compensation
committee charter, which details the principal functions of the compensation committee, including: 

reviewing and approving
 on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officer s compensation, if any is paid
 by us, evaluating our Chief Executive Officer s performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving
 the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officer based on such evaluation; 

reviewing and approving
 on an annual basis the compensation, if any is paid by us, of all of our other officers; 

reviewing on an annual
 basis our executive compensation policies and plans; 

implementing and administering
 our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans; 

assisting management in
 complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements; 

approving all special perquisites,
 special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our officers and employees; 

if required, producing
 a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and 

reviewing, evaluating and
 recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors. 

41 

Notwithstanding the foregoing,
as indicated above, other than the payment to our sponsor or an affiliate thereof of 10,000 per month, until April 25, 2023 (or until
July 25, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms described in
this Report), for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support and reimbursement of expenses, no compensation of
any kind, including finder s, consulting or other similar fees, will be paid to any of our officers, directors, executive advisors
or any of their respective affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate the consummation of an initial
business combination. Accordingly, it is likely that prior to the consummation of an initial business combination, the compensation committee
will only be responsible for the review and recommendation of any compensation arrangements to be entered into in connection with such
initial business combination. 

The charter also provides
that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel
or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However,
before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee
will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by the NYSE and the SEC. 

Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 

We have established a nominating
and corporate governance committee of the board of directors. The members of our nominating and corporate governance committee are Greg
Hill, Livia Mahler and Dennis McGinn. Mr. Hill, Ms. Mahler and Vice Admiral McGinn are independent, and Mr. Hill serves as
chair of the nominating and corporate governance committee. 

The primary purposes of our
nominating and corporate governance committee is to assist the board in: 

identifying, screening
 and reviewing individuals qualified to serve as directors and recommending to the board of directors candidates for nomination for
 election at the annual meeting of shareholders or to fill vacancies on the board of directors; 

developing and recommending
 to the board of directors and overseeing implementation of our corporate governance guidelines; 

coordinating and overseeing
 the annual self-evaluation of the board of directors, its committees, individual directors and management in the governance
 of the company; and 

reviewing on a regular
 basis our overall corporate governance and recommending improvements as and when necessary. 

The nominating and corporate
governance committee is governed by a charter that complies with the rules of the NYSE. 

Our nominating and corporate
governance committee will recommend to the board of directors candidates for nomination for election at the annual meeting of the shareholders.
We have not formally established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to
possess. In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, the board of directors considers educational background, diversity
of professional experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom, and the ability to represent
the best interests of our shareholders. 

42 

Prior to our initial business
combination, our board will also consider director candidates recommended for nomination by holders of our founder shares during such
times as they are seeking proposed nominees to stand for appointment at an annual general meeting (or, if applicable, an extraordinary
general meeting). Prior to our initial business combination, holders of our public shares will not have the right to recommend director
candidates for nomination to our board. 

Code of Ethics 

We have adopted a Code of
Ethics applicable to our directors and officers. We have filed a copy of our form of Code of Ethics as an exhibit to the IPO Registration
Statement. You can review these documents by accessing our public filings at the SEC s web site at www.sec.gov . In
addition, a copy of the Code of Ethics will be provided without charge upon request from us. We intend to disclose any amendments to
or waivers of certain provisions of our Code of Ethics in a Current Report on Form 8-K. 

Our board has adopted corporate
governance guidelines in accordance with the corporate governance rules of the NYSE that serve as a flexible framework within which our
board and its committees operate. These guidelines cover a number of areas including board membership criteria and director qualifications,
director responsibilities, board agenda, roles of the chairman of the board, chief executive officer and presiding director, meetings
of independent directors, committee responsibilities and assignments, board member access to management and independent advisors, director
communications with third parties, director compensation, director orientation and continuing education, evaluation of senior management
and management succession planning. A copy of our corporate governance guidelines are posted on our website at https://www.gogreeninvestments.com/about/#govern. 

Item 11. Executive Compensation. 

None of our officers or directors
have received any cash compensation from us for services rendered to us. We pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of 10,000 per month
for office space, administrative and support services. Our sponsor, officers and directors, or entities with which they are affiliated,
are reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential
target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee reviews on a quarterly basis all
payments that were made to our sponsor, officers, directors or any entity with which they are affiliated. 

After the completion of our
initial business combination, directors or members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other
fees from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to shareholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer
materials or proxy solicitation materials furnished to our shareholders in connection with a proposed business combination, such as the
Lifezone Registration Statement. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time such materials are distributed,
because the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining officer and director compensation. Any
compensation to be paid to our officers will be determined by a compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors. 

We do not intend to take
any action to ensure that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the consummation of our initial business
combination, although it is possible that some or all of our officers and directors may negotiate employment or consulting arrangements
to remain with us after the initial business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements to
retain their positions with us may influence our management s motivation in identifying or selecting a target business but we do
not believe that the ability of our management to remain with us after the consummation of our initial business combination will be a
determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential business combination. We are not party to any agreements with our officers
and directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related
Transactions, and Director Independence. 

In April 2021, our sponsor
purchased an aggregate of 7,187,500 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of 25,000, or approximately 0.004 per share. In
September 2021, our sponsor forfeited 1,437,500 founder shares, resulting in our sponsor holding 5,750,000 founder shares, up to 750,000
of which were subject to forfeiture to the extent the over-allotment option was not exercised in full by the underwriters. On October
20, 2021, the Company effectuated a share capitalization of 1,150,000 founder shares, resulting in an aggregate of 6,900,000 founder
shares outstanding and held by our sponsor, up to 900,000 of which were subject to forfeiture to the extent the over-allotment option
was not exercised in full by the underwriters. The founder shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares upon consummation
of a business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to certain adjustments. The sponsor agreed to forfeit up to 900,000 founder
shares to the extent the over-allotment option was not exercised in full by the underwriters. As a result of the underwriters 
over-allotment exercise in full, no shares were forfeited. 

Our sponsor purchased an
aggregate of 1,335,000 placement units at a price of 10.00 per unit, for an aggregate purchase price of 13,350,000 in a private
placement that occurred simultaneously with the completion of our initial public offering. The placement units (including the units that
may be issued upon conversion of extension loans and working capital loans and their respective component securities) may not, subject
to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holders until 30 days after the consummation of our initial
business combination. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our founder shares or placement
shares (including shares issued or exercisable as part of the units and their component securities issuable upon conversion of extension
loans and working capital loans). 

45 

The placement units were
sold in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) or Regulation D of the Securities Act and are exempt from registration requirements
under the federal securities laws. As such, the holders of the placement warrants included in the placement units will be able to exercise
such placement warrants even if, at the time of exercise, an effective registration statement and a current prospectus relating to the
ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of such warrants is not available. 

On March 17, 2021, the sponsor
agreed to loan us an aggregate of up to 300,000 to cover expenses related to our initial public offering pursuant to a promissory note
(the Promissory Note ). In September 2021, we amended and restated the Promissory Note (the Amended and Restated
Promissory Note ), which increased the loan amount to 500,000 and extended the due date to March 31, 2022. All borrowings outstanding
under the Amended and Restated Promissory Note were repaid in connection with the closing of our initial public offering. 

Pursuant to an administrative
services agreement entered into between the Company and our sponsor, since October 2021 we have paid a total of 10,000 per month to
our sponsor for office space, administrative and support services. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation,
we will cease paying these monthly fees. Accordingly, in the event the consummation of our initial business combination takes until April
25, 2023 (or until July 25, 2023 if we fully extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with
the terms described in this Report), our sponsor will be paid a total of 180,000 (or up to a total of 210,000 if we fully extend until
July 25, 2023 as described elsewhere in this Report) and will be entitled to be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses. 

On
June 6, 2022, we issued a promissory note (the First Working Capital Note in the principal amount of up to 300,000 to
our sponsor. The First Working Capital Note was issued in connection with advances our sponsor has made, and may make in the future,
to us for working capital expenses. The First Working Capital Note bears no interest and is due and payable upon the earlier to occur
of (i) the date on which we consummate our initial business combination and (ii) the date that the winding up of the Company is effective.
At the election of our sponsor, all or a portion of the unpaid principal amount of the First Working Capital Note may be converted into
units, each unit consisting of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one warrant, each whole warrant exercisable for one Class A
ordinary share (the Conversion Units ), equal to: (x) the portion of the principal amount of the First Working Capital Note
being converted, divided by (y) 10.00, rounded up to the nearest whole number of units. The Conversion Units are identical to the placement
units issued to our sponsor in the private placement in connection with our initial public offering. The Conversion Units and their underlying
securities are entitled to the registration rights set forth in the First Working Capital Note. 

On
January 18, 2023, our sponsor requested that the Company extend the date by which it must consummate an initial business combination
from January 25, 2023 to April 25, 2023. In connection with the Extension, on January 19, 2023, we issued the Extension Note in the principal
amount of 2,760,000 to our sponsor. The Extension Note bears no interest and is due and payable in cash upon the earlier to occur of
(i) the date on which the initial business combination is consummated and (ii) the liquidation of the Company on or before April 25,
2023 (or July 25, 2023 if we fully extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms
described in this Report) or such later liquidation date as may be approved by the Company s shareholders. On January 19, 2023,
our sponsor deposited the Extension Payment (representing 0.10 per public share) into the trust account. This deposit enabled us to
implement the Extension. 

46 

The
Extension is the first of two three-month extensions permitted under our governing documents as described elsewhere in this Report. If
we complete our initial business combination, we will, at the option of our sponsor, repay loaned amounts related to the extensions out
of the proceeds of the trust account released to us or convert a portion or all of the total loan amount into units at a price of 10.00
per unit, which units will be identical to the placement units. If we do not complete a business combination, we will repay such loans
only from funds held outside of the trust account, if any such funds are available. We currently believe we will not have sufficient
funds left outside of the trust account to pay back such loans if our initial business combination is not completed. 

In
the event that we receive notice from our sponsor five days prior to the deadline of its wish for us to effect an additional extension,
we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the deadline. In addition, we intend to issue
a press release the day after the deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our sponsor and its affiliates
or permitted designees are not obligated to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. 

Additionally, on January
19, 2023, we issued a promissory note to our sponsor (the Second Working Capital Note in the principal amount of up to
 300,000 for working capital expenses. The Second Working Capital Note bears no interest and is due and payable in cash upon the earlier
to occur of (i) the date on which we consummates our initial business combination and (ii) the date that the winding up of the Company
is effective. As of February 24, 2023, a total of 200,000 has been borrowed under the Working Capital Note. 

In order to finance transaction
costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers
and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us additional funds as may be required. If we complete an initial business combination,
we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working
capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment.
Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units at a price of 10.00 per unit at the option of the lender at the time of
the initial business combination. The units would be identical to the placement units sold in the private placement. The terms of any
additional loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined except as otherwise described herein and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek
access to funds in our trust account. 

Our sponsor, officers, directors,
executive advisors or any entities with which they are affiliated are reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations.
Our audit committee reviews on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers, directors, executive advisors
or any entities with which they are affiliated and determines which expenses and the amount of expenses that are to be reimbursed. There
is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our
behalf. 

If any of our officers or
directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she
has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to
such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands
law. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over
their duties to us. 

47 

Other than repayment of any
loans which our sponsor, members of our management team, executive advisors or any of their respective affiliates or other third parties
may make to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination (provided that if we do not consummate
an initial business combination, we may use working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds
from our trust account would be used for such repayment), payments to our sponsor or its affiliate of a total of 10,000 per month for
office space, administrative and support services, and reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigation
and completing an initial business combination, there will be no finder s fees, reimbursements or cash payments made to our sponsor,
officers, directors, executive advisors or any entities with which they are affiliated; our officers, directors and executive advisors
will have an economic interest in securities held by our sponsor. 

After our initial business
combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company
with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our shareholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer or proxy solicitation
materials, as applicable, furnished to our shareholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of
distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a general meeting held to consider our initial business combination, as
applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation. 

We have entered into a registration
rights agreement with respect to the founder shares, placement shares, placement warrants and Class A ordinary shares and warrants underlying
units issued upon conversion of either working capital or extension loans (if any). 

In connection with the Lifezone
Business Combination, we have entered into the Sponsor Support Agreement. We also expect to enter into the Sponsor Lock-up Agreement
and New Registration Rights Agreement in connection with the closing of the Share Acquisition. For more information about such agreements,
please see Item. 1 Business. 

Director Independence 

The NYSE listing standards
require that a majority of our board of directors be independent. An independent director is defined generally as a person
who has no material relationship with the listed company (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization
that has a relationship with the company). We have 6 independent directors as defined in the NYSE listing standards and
applicable SEC rules. 

Our board has determined
that each of Mr. Hill, Ms. Mahler, Mr. Macleod, Vice Admiral McGinn, Ms. Palmer and Ms. Flannery is an independent director
under applicable SEC and NYSE rules. Our independent directors have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors
are present.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of GoGreen Investments Corporation 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of GoGreen Investments Corporation (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of operations,
changes in shareholders deficit and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and the period from March 17, 2021 (inception)
to December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and the period from March 17, 2021 (inception) through December 31,
2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United State of America. 

Emphasis of a Matter Regarding Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, if the Company
is unable to complete a Business Combination by the close of business on April 25, 2023, then the Company will cease all operations except
for the purpose of liquidating. This date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of
this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and
are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2021.

who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters (as
discussed in Note 6). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company s
warrants. The Public Shares subject to redemption were recorded at their redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the
completion of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 ). The Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible
assets of at least either immediately prior to or upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks
shareholder approval, a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a shareholder vote is not required
by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other
legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the Amended and Restated
Memorandum and Articles of Association ), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however,
shareholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or the Company decides to
obtain shareholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation
pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a
Business Combination, the Company s Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5), Placement Shares (as defined
in Note 4) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally,

the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors,

through a portion of the net proceeds from the Placement Units, and the funding of working capital loans received from its Sponsor. Until
the consummation of a Business Combination, the Company will be using the funds not held in the Trust Account for identifying and evaluating
prospective acquisition candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting
the target business to acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. In order to finance transaction
costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Company will need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments
