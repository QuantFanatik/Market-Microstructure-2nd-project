FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

In this Annual Report, references to Atlantica, Inc., Atlantica, 
the Company, we, us, our and words of similar import refer to Atlantica, Inc.,
the Registrant. 

This Annual Report contains certain forward-looking statements, and for
this purpose, any statements contained in this Annual Report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking
statements. Without limiting the foregoing, words such as may, will, expect, believe, 
 anticipate, estimate or continue or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking
statements. These statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially depending
on a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control. These factors include but are not limited to economic conditions generally
and in the markets in which we may participate, competition within our chosen industry, technological advances and failure by us to successfully
develop business relationships. 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Business Development 

Our Company was organized pursuant to the laws of the State of Utah on
March 3, 1938, under the name Red Hills Mining Company, with an authorized capital of 20,000 divided into 2,000,000 shares
of common stock of a par value of 0.01 per share. Our Company was formed for the primary purpose of conducting the business of mining
in all of its branches. 

On February 5, 1953, we changed our name to Allied
Oil and Minerals Company, with our primary purpose continuing to be mining. 

On January 8, 1971, we changed our name to Community
Equities Corporation, we increased our authorized capital from 20,000 to 150,000, comprised of 15,000,000 at .01 and our purpose
also changed to the business of real estate development. We discontinued the real estate development operations in 1990. 

Effective March 26, 1996, the corporate charter was
reinstated, and we changed our corporate name to Atlantica, Inc. 

On March 13, 1998, we increased our authorized capital
from 15,000,000 shares of .01 par value to 25,000,000 shares of 0.0001 par value common stock; and we authorized a reverse split of
one share for every 20 shares. We also authorized the issuance of 24,000,000 shares to Gregory Aurre, President and a director, for services
rendered and expenses paid. The Board also issued 25,000 shares each to Amerika Aurre, Vice President and a director and Gregory Aurre
III, Secretary and a director, for services rendered. We also adopted new Bylaws. 

On October 30, 2002, the Board of Directors resolved
to appoint new officers and directors since Gregory Aurre II, Gregory Aurre III and Amerika Aurre all resigned, in seriatim, from any
and all capacity as officers and directors. Thomas J. Howells was appointed as President and director, Terry Jenson as Vice President
and director and Travis T. Jenson as Secretary and director. 

On November 12, 2002, the 23,908,000 shares held by
Gregory Aurre II, were foreclosed on to satisfy debt in the amount of 80,000, owed to Duane S. Jenson. Mr. Jenson had personally
loaned Mr. Aurre the 80,000 which was secured solely by Mr. Aurre s shares of the Company. Subsequent to foreclosing
on the shares of Mr. Aurre s that were held by Mr. Jenson as security for the loan, Mr. Jenson elected to gift a
portion of those shares to his son, Travis T. Jenson, as well as to a business associate, Thomas J. Howells, and a long-time friend and
legal counsel, Leonard W. Burningham, Esq. 

On November 15, 2002, we were reinstated with the
State of Utah. 

3 

On November 30, 2004, Thomas J. Howells resigned as
President and a director and Travis T. Jenson resigned as Secretary and a director. Shelley Goff and Duane S. Jenson were appointed as
Secretary and President, respectively. Mr. Jenson and Ms. Goff were also elected as directors. 

A copy of our Bylaws was attached to our Annual Report
for the year ended December 31, 2001, and is incorporated herein by reference. See Part IV, Item 15. 

A copy of our Articles of Incorporation, as amended,
was attached to our initial Registration Statement on Form 10-SB and is incorporated herein by reference. See Part IV, Item 15. 

On December 27, 2006, we filed a definitive Information
Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding a one-for-10 (1:10) pro rata reverse split of our outstanding common stock
(Proposal 1) and the adoption of Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (Proposal 2), to be voted upon at a special meeting of
our shareholders (the Meeting ). The Information Statement that was mailed to our stockholders was accompanied by a Notice
of Special Meeting of Shareholders, both of which were mailed to our shareholders on or about January 5, 2007. Please see the Exhibit
Index, Part IV, Item 15, for a copy of the Definitive Information Statement, as filed on December 27, 2006, which is incorporated herein
by reference. 

These resolutions were unanimously adopted by our
Board of Directors. Duane S. Jenson, and his son, Travis T. Jenson, who, at that time, collectively, beneficially owned 16,000,683 shares
of our common stock or approximately 65.1 of our outstanding voting securities, agreed to and intended to vote in favor of the Proposals
at the Meeting. No other votes were required or necessary to adopt these Proposals. 

The Meeting was held at 4685 South Highland Drive,
#202, Salt Lake City, Utah, 84117, on January 26, 2007, at 11:00 o clock a.m., Mountain Standard Time. Present at the Meeting was
Leonard W. Burningham, Esq., former counsel for the Company, Duane S. Jenson and Travis T. Jenson, representing 19,908,683 shares, or
approximately 81 , of the 24,581,458 shares of our outstanding voting securities at that time. 

All shares represented at the Meeting voted in favor
of both Proposals. The reverse split subsequently became effective on February 15, 2007. That stock split is reflected herein on a retroactive
basis. 

On June 29, 2007, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement
among Mirabella Holdings, LLC, (the Purchaser ), Duane S. Jenson, Travis T. Jenson, Thomas J. Howells, Leonard W. Burningham
(collectively with Duane S. Jenson, Travis T. Jenson and Thomas J. Howells, the Sellers ), and Leonard W. Burningham, as
the representative of the Sellers, the Purchaser acquired from the Sellers a total of 1,966,872 shares of the Company s common stock
(the Acquisition ), representing 80 of the Company s currently outstanding shares, for a purchase price of 525,000
in cash. Upon the closing of the Acquisition, Duane S. Jenson and Terry Jenson resigned as directors and executive officers, Shelley Goff
resigned as a director, retained her office as the Company s Secretary and was appointed the Company s Chief Financial Officer;
and Alan D. Gordon was appointed as the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer. In connection with the Acquisition and
effective July 16, 2007, Alan D. Gordon, Frederick G. Pierce, II and Richard F. Strup were elected as directors, and Duane S. Jenson,
Terry Jenson and Shelley Goff resigned as directors. 

In addition, pursuant to a Share Escrow and Reset Agreement (the Reset
Agreement entered into among the Purchaser, the Sellers Representative, the Sellers, the Company and the escrow agent thereunder
contemporaneously with the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Sellers placed in escrow an additional 423,928 shares of the Company s
Common Stock then owned by them (the Escrow Shares ), which at the time represented all but 70 of the remaining shares of
the Company s Common Stock owned by the Sellers. Pursuant to the Reset Agreement, if, during the five-year period following
June 29, 2007 (the Acquisition Period ), the Company acquired one or more companies having a combined enterprise value of
at least 10 million (a Threshold Acquisition ), the Escrow Shares would reset, at that time, to a number of newly-issued
shares of the Company s Common Stock that would represent (collectively with the 70 shares previously retained by the Sellers) 5 
of the Company s then fully-diluted Common Stock. If a Threshold Acquisition did not occur during the Acquisition Period, all of
the Escrow Shares would be released to the Sellers without any reissuance or adjustment in their amount. 

4 

A Threshold Acquisition by the Company did not occur during the Acquisition
Period and, as a result, the Company subsequently received the required notice from the Sellers Representative requesting the release
of the Escrow Shares to the Sellers in accordance with the terms of the Reset Agreement. Accordingly, on November 12, 2012, all of the
Escrow Shares were released to the Sellers without any reissuance or adjustment in their amount. 

See the 8-K Current Report dated June 29, 2007 and
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 3, 2007, and see the Schedule 14F-1 Information Statement filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on July 3, 2007 and mailed to our stockholders on or about July 5, 2007. See Part IV, Item 15 of this Report. 

Description of Business 

We are currently seeking potential assets, property or businesses to acquire,
in a business combination, by reorganization, merger or acquisition. We have had no material business operations since March 7, 1997.
Our plan of operation for the next 12 months is to: (i) consider guidelines of industries in which we may have an interest; (ii) adopt
a business plan regarding engaging in the business of any selected industry; and (iii) to commence operations through funding and/or the
acquisition or business combination with a going concern engaged in any industry selected. We are unable to predict the
time as to when and if we may actually participate in any specific business endeavor, and we will be unable to do so until we determine
any particular industry in which we may conduct business operations. 

We are not currently engaged in any substantive business activity except
the search for potential assets, property or businesses to acquire, and we have no current plans to engage in any other activity in the
foreseeable future unless and until we complete any such acquisition. In our present form, we are deemed to be a shell company 
seeking to acquire or merge with a business or company. We do not intend to restrict our search for business opportunities to any particular
business or industry, and the areas in which we will seek out business opportunities may include all lawful businesses. We recognize that
the number of suitable potential business ventures that may be available to us will be extremely limited, and may be restricted to businesses
or entities that desire to become a publicly-held company while avoiding what many may deem to be the adverse factors related to an initial
public offering IPO as a method of going public. The most prevalent of these factors include the substantial
time requirements, legal and accounting costs, the inability to obtain an underwriter who is willing to publicly offer and sell securities
on behalf of the particular entity, the lack of or the inability to obtain the required financial statements for such an undertaking,
state limitations on the amount of dilution to public investors in comparison to the stockholders of any such entity, along with other
conditions or requirements imposed by various federal and state securities laws, rules and regulations and federal and state agencies
that implement them. 

Amendments to SEC Form 8 K regarding shell companies and transactions
with shell companies require the filing of all information about an acquired company that would have been required to have been filed
had any such company filed a Form 10 Registration Statement with the SEC, along with required audited, interim and proforma financial
statements, within four business days of the closing of any such transaction (Item 5.01(a)(8) of Form 8-K); and the recent amendments
to Rule 144 Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act adopted by the SEC that
were effective on February 15, 2008, that limit the resale of most securities of shell companies until 12 months after the filing of such
information (the Form 10 Information ), may eliminate many of the perceived advantages of going public transactions with
shell companies. These types of transactions are customarily referred to as reverse reorganizations or mergers in which
the acquired company s stockholders become the controlling stockholders in the acquiring company and the acquiring company becomes
the successor to the business operations of the acquired company. Regulations governing shell companies also deny the use of SEC Form
S 8 for the registration of securities and limit the use of SEC Form S-8 to a reorganized shell company until the expiration of 60
days from when any such entity is no longer considered to be a shell company. This prohibition could further restrict opportunities for
us to acquire companies that may already have stock option plans in place that cover numerous employees. In such instances, there may
be no exemption from registration for the issuance of securities in any business combination to these employees, thereby necessitating
the filing of a registration statement with the SEC to complete any such reorganization, and incurring the time and expenses that are
normally avoided by reverse reorganizations or mergers. 

Amendments to Rule 144, adopted by the SEC and effective on February 15,
2008, codify the SEC s prior position limiting the tradeability of certain securities of shell companies, including those issued
by us in any business combination, and further limit the tradeability of additional securities of shell companies; these proposals will 

5 

further restrict the availability of opportunities
for us to acquire any business or enterprise that desires to utilize us as a means of going public. See the heading Rule 144 
in Part II, Item 5, for a discussion of the general requirements of Rule 144 and the limitations of Rule 144 with respect to shell companies. 

Any of these types of business combination transactions, regardless of
the particular prospect, would require us to issue a substantial number of shares of our common stock that could amount to as much as
95 or more of our outstanding voting securities; accordingly, investments in the private enterprise, if available, would be much more
favorable than any investment in us. 

Management intends to consider a number of factors prior to making any
decision to participate in any specific business endeavor, none of which may be determinative or provide any assurance of success. These
may include, but will not be limited to, as applicable, an analysis of the quality of the particular business or entity s management
and personnel; the anticipated acceptability of any new products or marketing concepts that any such business or company may have; the
merits of any such business s or company s technology or intellectual property; the present financial condition, projected
growth potential and available technical, financial and managerial resources; working capital, history of operations and future prospects;
the nature of present and expected competition; the quality and experience of any such business s or company s management
services and the depth of management; the business or the company s potential for further research, development or exploration;
risk factors specifically related to the business s or company s operations; the potential for growth, expansion and profit;
the perceived public recognition or acceptance of products, or services offered and trademarks and name identification; and numerous other
factors that are difficult, if not impossible, to properly or accurately quantify or analyze, let alone describe or identify, without
referring to specific objective criteria of an identified business or company. 

Regardless, the results of operations of any specific entity may not necessarily
be indicative of what may occur in the future, by reason of changing market strategies, plant or product expansion, changes in product
emphasis, future management personnel and changes in innumerable other factors. Further, in the case of a new business venture or one
that is in a research and development mode, the risks will be substantial, and there will be no objective criteria to examine the effectiveness
or the abilities of its management or its business objectives. Also, a firm market for its products or services may yet need to be established,
and with no past track record, the profitability of any such business will be unproven and cannot be predicted with any certainty. 

Our management will attempt to meet personally with management and key
personnel of any entity providing a potential business opportunity for us, visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent analysis
or verification of information provided and gathered, check references of material personnel and conduct other reasonably prudent measures
calculated to ensure a reasonably thorough review of any particular business opportunity; however, due to time constraints of management
and limited capital, these activities may be limited. 

We are unable to predict the time as to when and if we may actually participate
in any specific business endeavor or if at all. We anticipate that proposed business ventures will be made available to us through personal
contacts of directors, executive officers and principal stockholders, professional advisors, broker dealers in securities, venture capital
personnel and others who may present unsolicited proposals. In certain cases, we may agree to pay a finder s fee or to otherwise
compensate the persons who submit a potential business endeavor in which we eventually participate. Such persons may include our directors,
executive officers and beneficial owners of our securities or their affiliates. In this regard, see the description of our management
services agreement with Richland, Gordon Company contained in Part III, Item 13 of this Report, and a copy of that agreement included
in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report, with respect to, among other things, certain cash fees that may be payable by us to Richland, Gordon
in connection with future financings and business combinations by us. In this event, such fees may become a factor in negotiations regarding
any potential venture and, accordingly, may present a conflict of interest for such individuals. 

Although we currently have no plans to do so, depending on the nature and
extent of services rendered, we may compensate members of our management in the future for services that they may perform for us. Because
we currently have extremely limited resources, and we are unlikely to have any significant resources until we have determined a business
or enterprise to engage in or have completed a business combination, management expects that any such compensation would take the form
of an issuance of shares of our common stock to these persons; this would have the effect of further diluting the holdings of our other
stockholders. There are presently no preliminary agreements or understandings between us and members of our management respecting such
compensation. Any shares issued to members of our management would be required to be resold under an effective registration 

6 

statement filed with the SEC or could not
be publicly sold until 12 months after we file the Form 10 information about the business combination with the SEC as required by SEC
Form 8-K. These provisions could further inhibit our ability to complete any business combination where finders or others who may be
subject to these resale limitations refuse to provide us with any introductions or to close any such transactions unless they are paid
requested fees in cash rather than our shares or unless we agree to file a registration statement with the SEC that includes any shares
that are to be issued to them, at no cost to them. These expenses could limit potential acquisition candidates, especially those in need
of cash resources, and could affect the number of shares that our stockholders retain following any such transaction, by reason of the
increased expense. 

Substantial fees are also often paid in connection with the completion
of all types of business combinations, ranging from a small amount to as much as 400,000 or more. These fees are usually divided among
promoters or founders or finders, after deduction of legal, accounting and other related expenses, and it is not unusual for a portion
of these fees to be paid to members of management or to principal stockholders as consideration for their agreement to retire a portion
of their shares of common stock or as consideration to them to provide an indemnification for all of our prior liabilities. Members of
management may also actively negotiate or otherwise consent to the purchase of all or any portion of their shares of common stock as a
condition to, or in connection with, a proposed business combination. It is not anticipated that any such opportunity will be afforded
to other stockholders or that such other stockholders will be afforded the opportunity to approve or consent to any particular stock buy-out
transaction. In the event that any such fees are paid or shares are purchased, these requirements may become a factor in negotiations
regarding any business combination with us and, accordingly, may also present a conflict of interest for such individuals. Any of these
types of fees that are paid in shares of our common stock will also be subject to the resale limitations embodied in Rule 144 that prohibit,
among other requirements, the public resale of these shares until 12 months after the filing of the Form 10 information with the SEC.
We have no present arrangements or understandings respecting any of these types of fees or opportunities, other than pursuant to our management
services agreement with Richland, Gordon Company. See the description of our management services agreement with Richland, Gordon
 Company contained in Part III, Item 13 of this Report, and a copy of that agreement included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report,
with respect to, among other things, certain cash fees that may be payable by us to Richland, Gordon in connection with future financings
and business combinations by us. 

Atlantica, Inc. does not have a web site. 

Competitive Business Conditions and Our Competitive Position in the
Industry and Methods of Competition 

Management believes that there are literally thousands of shell companies
engaged in endeavors similar to those engaged in by us; many of these companies have substantial current assets and cash reserves. Competitors
also include thousands of other publicly-held companies whose business operations have proven unsuccessful, and whose only viable business
opportunity is that of providing a publicly-held vehicle through which a private entity may have access to the public capital markets
via a reverse reorganization or merger. There is no reasonable way to predict our competitive position or that of any other entity in
these endeavors; however, we, have limited assets and no cash reserves, will no doubt be at a competitive disadvantage in competing with
shell companies that have significant cash resources and have recent operating histories when compared with our lack of any substantive
operations for many years. 

Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on our Business 

We are subject to the following regulations of the SEC and applicable securities
laws, rules and regulations: 

Smaller Reporting Company 

We are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and subject to the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K of the
SEC, as a smaller reporting company. That designation will relieve us of some of the informational requirements of Regulation
S-K applicable to larger companies. 

7 

Sarbanes/Oxley
Act 

We are also subject to the Sarbanes/Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes/Oxley
Act created a strong and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public companies and strengthens
auditor independence. It also requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting
and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies; establishes clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public
view, possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; creates guidelines for audit committee members appointment,
compensation and oversight of the work of public companies auditors; management's assessment of our internal controls; auditor
attestation to management s conclusions about internal controls; prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout
periods; requires companies and auditors to evaluate internal controls and procedures; and establishes a federal crime of securities fraud,
among other provisions. Compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes/Oxley Act has substantially increased our legal and accounting
costs. 

Exchange Act Reporting Requirements 

Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act requires all companies with securities
registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding proxy solicitations,
as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to stockholders at special or annual meetings thereof or pursuant to a written consent
will require us to provide our stockholders with the information outlined in Schedules 14A or 14C of Regulation 14; preliminary copies
of this information must be submitted to the SEC at least 10 days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are forwarded
to our stockholders. 

We are also required to file Annual Reports on SEC Form 10-K and Quarterly
Reports on SEC Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and will be required to timely disclose certain material events (e.g., changes
in corporate control; acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; and
bankruptcy) in a Current Report on SEC Form 8-K. 

Emerging Growth Company 

We are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart
Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act. As long as we remain an emerging growth company, we may take
advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not an emerging
growth company, like those applicable to a smaller reporting company, including, but not limited to, a scaled down
description of our business in Securities and Exchange Commission filings; no requirements to include risk factors in Exchange Act filings;
no requirement to include certain selected financial data and supplementary financial information in Securities and Exchange Commission
filings; not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; reduced disclosure
obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements that we file under the Exchange Act; no requirement
for Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b) auditor attestations of internal control over financial reporting; and exemptions from the requirements
of holding an annual nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and seeking nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden parachute
payments not previously approved. We are also only required to file audited financial statements for the previous two fiscal years when
filing registration statements, together with reviewed financial statements of any applicable subsequent quarter. 

We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer
an emerging growth company. We can remain an emerging growth company for up to five years. We would cease
to be an emerging growth company prior to such time if we have total annual gross revenues of 1 billion or more and when
we become a larger accelerated filer, have a public float of 700 million or more or we issue more than 1 billion of non-convertible
debt over a three-year period. 

Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new
or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail
ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting
standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.

Number of Total Employees and Number of Full Time Employees 

We have no employees. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide risk factors. 

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 

There are no unresolved staff comments. 

ITEM 2: PROPERTIES 

Our Company has no assets, property or business; its
principal executive office address and telephone number are the office address and telephone number of Alan D. Gordon, who is our President
and a director and an affiliate of Mirabella Holdings, LLC (our current majority stockholder), which are provided at no cost to the Company.
See Part I, Item 1. Because the Company has had no business, its activities have been limited to keeping itself in good standing in the
State of Utah. These activities have consumed an insignificant amount of management s time; accordingly, the costs to Mr. Gordon
of providing the use of his office and telephone have been minimal. 

ITEM 3: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We are not a party to any pending legal proceeding and, to the knowledge
of our management; no federal, state or local governmental agency is presently contemplating any proceeding against us. No director, executive
officer or affiliate of ours or owner of record or beneficially of more than 5 of our common stock is a party adverse to us or has a
material interest adverse to us in any proceeding. 

ITEM 4: MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 

None; not applicable. 

PART II 

ITEM 5: MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER
MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 

Market Information 

There is no established trading market for our shares of
common stock. Commencing on or about January 5, 2006, our shares of common stock were listed on the OTC Bulletin Board of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. FINRA under the symbol AIAN we received a new symbol of ATTC 
in conjunction with the reverse split as discussed under the caption Business Development herein. We applied for a symbol
change and were granted on October 14, 2013, the new symbol ALDA. However, management does not expect any established trading
market to develop in our shares of common stock unless and until we have material operations. In any event, no assurance can be given
that any market for our common stock will develop or be maintained. If a public market ever develops in the future, the sale of shares
of our common stock that are deemed to be restricted securities pursuant to Rule 144 by members of management or others
may have a substantial adverse impact on any such market.

Shell Companies 

The following is an excerpt from Rule 144(i) regarding resales of securities
of shell companies: 

(i) Unavailability to securities of issuers with no or
nominal operations and no or nominal non-cash assets . 

(1) This section
is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by an issuer defined below: 

(i) An issuer,
other than a business combination related shell company, as defined in 230.405, or an asset-backed issuer, as defined in Item 1101(b)
of Regulation AB 229.1101(b) of this chapter), that has: 

(A) No or
nominal operations; and 

(B) Either: 

(1) No or
nominal assets; 

(2) Assets
consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents; or 

(3) Assets
consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets; or 

(ii) An issuer
that has been at any time previously an issuer described in paragraph (i)(1)(i). 

(2) Notwithstanding
paragraph (i)(1), if the issuer of the securities previously had been an issuer described in paragraph (i)(1)(i) but has ceased to be
an issuer described in paragraph (i)(1)(i); is subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; has filed
all reports and other materials required to be filed by section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as applicable, during the preceding 12
months (or for such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Form 8-K reports 249.308
of this chapter); and has filed current Form 10 information with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is no longer
an issuer described in paragraph (i)(1)(i), then those securities may be sold subject to the requirements of this section after 12 months
have elapsed from the date that the issuer filed Form 10 information with the SEC. 

(3) The term
 Form 10 information means the information that is required by Form 10 or Form 20-F 249.220f of this chapter), as
applicable to the issuer of the securities, to register under the Exchange Act each class of securities being sold under this rule. The
issuer may provide the Form 10 information in any filing of the issuer with the SEC. The Form 10 information 
is deemed filed when the initial filing is made with the SEC. 

Securities of a shell company cannot be publicly sold under Rule 144 in
the absence of compliance with this subparagraph. 

Section 4(1) of the Securities Act 

Since we are a shell company as defined in subparagraph (i) of Rule 144,
our shares of common stock that were issued while or after we became a shell company cannot be publicly resold under Rule 144 until we
comply with the requirements outlined above under the heading Shell Companies. Until those requirements have been satisfied,
any resales of our shares of common stock must be made in compliance with the provisions of the exemption from registration under the
Securities Act provided in Section 4(1) thereof, applicable to persons other than an issuer, underwriter or a dealer. That
will require that such shares of common stock be sold in routine trading transactions, which would include compliance with
substantially all of the requirements of Rule 144, including the availability of current public information about us as
required by subparagraph (c) (1) or (c)(2) of Rule 144, regardless of the Rule s availability; and such resales may be limited to
our non-affiliates. It has been the position of the SEC that the Section 4(1) exemption is not available for the resale of any securities
of an issuer that is or was a shell company, by directors, executive officers, promoters or founders or their transferees. See NASD
Regulation, Inc. , CCH Federal Securities Law Reporter, 1990-2000 Decisions, Paragraph No. 77,681, the so-called Worm-Wulff
Letter. The current position of the SEC that is contained in Securities Act Release No. 33-8869, effective February 15, 2008, and
that codified the position of the SEC set forth in the Worm-Wulff Letter and revised Rule 144 as outlined above, is that Rule 144 now
defines what resales can be made under Section 4(1) of the Securities Act, and with limited exceptions, which are set forth in footnote
172 of that Release, shares of shell companies must be sold in compliance with Rule 144(i) that is quoted above. 

11 

Holders 

We currently have 661 shareholders, not including
an indeterminate number who may hold shares in street name. 

Dividends 

We have not declared any cash dividends with respect to our common stock,
and do not intend to declare dividends in the foreseeable future. Our future dividend policy cannot be ascertained with any certainty,
and if and until we determine to engage in any business or we complete any acquisition, reorganization or merger, no such policy will
be formulated. There are currently no material restrictions limiting, or that are likely to limit, our ability to pay dividends on our
securities. 

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds from Registered
Securities 

We have had no recent sales of restricted securities. 

Use of Proceeds of Registered Securities 

There were no proceeds received during the calendar
year ended December 31, 2022, from the sale of registered securities. 

Purchases of Equity Securities by Us and Affiliated
Purchasers 

During the last three fiscal years, there were no
purchases of any equity securities of ours by us or any person on our behalf; nor were there any purchases of our equity securities by
any affiliate of ours during the last three fiscal years. 

ITEM 6: [RESERVED] 

ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Forward looking Statements 

Statements made in this Annual Report, which are not purely historical,
are forward looking statements with respect to the goals, plan objectives, intentions, expectations, financial condition, results
of operations, future performance and our business, including, without limitation, (i) our ability to raise capital, and (ii) statements
preceded by, followed by or that include the words may, would, could, should, 
 expects, projects, anticipates, believes, estimates, plans, 
 intends, targets or similar expressions. 

Forward looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties,
and actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements, depending upon a number of factors,
many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: general economic or industry conditions;
nationally and/or in the communities in which we may conduct business; changes in the interest rate environment; legislation or regulatory
requirements; conditions of the securities markets; our ability to raise capital; changes in accounting principles; policies or guidelines;
financial or political instability; acts of war or terrorism; and other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technical
factors affecting our current or potential business and related matters. 

Accordingly, results actually achieved may differ materially from expected
results in these statements. Forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake, and specifically
disclaim, any obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of such
statements. 

12 

Plan of Operation 

Our plan of operation for the next 12 months is to: (i) consider guidelines
of industries in which we may have an interest; (ii) adopt a business plan regarding engaging in the business of any selected industry;
and (iii) commence such operations through funding and/or the acquisition of a going concern engaged in any industry selected. 

During the next 12 months, our only foreseeable cash requirements will
relate to maintaining our good standing; the payment of our SEC reporting filing expenses, including associated legal and accounting fees;
costs incident to reviewing or investigating any potential business venture; and maintaining our good standing as a corporation in our
state of incorporation. We anticipate that these funds will be provided to us in the form of loans from Mirabella Holdings, LLC Mirabella ),
our majority shareholder, although Mirabella is under no obligation to provide any such loans in the future. Currently, any such loans
that may be provided to us from time to time by Mirabella are made pursuant to a demand promissory note that has been issued by us to
Mirabella, which loans are unsecured, payable on demand and bear interest at a rate of 10 per annum, compounded quarterly. See the description
of that demand promissory note contained in Part III, Item 13 of this Report, and a copy of that note included in Part IV, Item 15 of
this Report. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have no current cash resources. 

The Company is relying on its principal shareholder
to pay all of its operating and other expenses until it can complete a reorganization or merger. While the Company's principal stockholder
currently pays the Company's limited operating and other expenses, on the Company's behalf, that principal stockholder is not obligated
to pay any of those expenses and the Company can provide no assurance that such stockholder will continue to pay any of those expenses
in the future. This stockholder paid a total of 64,478 in expenses for the Company in the year ended December 31, 2022, increasing the
aggregate principal amount of a demand note held by this stockholder to 681,527, plus accrued interest of 798,197, as of December 31,
2022. 

Results of Operations 

Year Ended December 31, 2022, Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2021 

Other than maintaining its good corporate standing
in the State of Utah, compromising and settling its debts and seeking the acquisition of assets, properties or businesses that may benefit
the Company and its stockholders, the Company has had no material business operations in the two most recent calendar years. 

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had 0
in assets. See the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 of this Annual Report. 

During the period ended December 31, 2022, the Company
had a net loss of 1,494,848, resulting from operations, as compared to a net loss of 288,868 for the same period ended December 31,
2021. Primarily all of these losses are the result of attorney s fees, accounting fees and management fees. See the Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data, Item 8 of this Report. 

During calendar 2022, expenses were paid by Mirabella,
a majority stockholder of the Company, in the aggregate amount of 64,478, and during calendar 2021 expenses were also paid by Mirabella
in the aggregate amount of 15,955. The aggregate principal amount of 681,527 plus accrued interest of 798,197 outstanding as of December
31, 2022 on the loans provided to us by Mirabella, which includes the 1,275 of expenses paid by Mirabella during 2007 that were not converted
into a capital contribution, is unsecured, bears interest at the rate of 10 per annum, compounded quarterly, and is due and payable to
Mirabella on demand. See the description of our demand promissory note issued to Mirabella contained in Part III, Item 13 of this Report,
and a copy of that note included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report. 

While Mirabella currently pays our limited operating
and other expenses on our behalf, Mirabella is not obligated to pay any of those expenses, and we can provide no assurance that Mirabella
will continue to pay any of those expenses in the future.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We had no Off-Balance Sheet arrangements of any kind
for the year ended December 31, 2022.

ITEM 9: CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS
ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

None; not applicable. 

ITEM 9A: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive and principal
financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual
Report. Based on that evaluation, our President and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period
covered by the Annual Report were effective and that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange
Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii)
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and our CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. 

Management s Annual Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving their control objectives. 

Our management, with the participation of the President and our CFO, evaluated
the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used
the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control
 Integrated Framework. Based on this evaluation, our management, with the participation of the President and CFO, concluded that,
as of December 31, 2022, our internal controls over financial reporting were effective. 

This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered
public accounting firm regarding our internal controls over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation
by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report
in this Annual Report. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in internal control over
financial reporting. 

ITEM 9B: OTHER INFORMATION 

None, not applicable. 

ITEM 9C: DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS

Promoters and control person. 

See the heading Transactions with Related Persons below. 

Compliance With Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act 

Our shares of common stock are registered under the Exchange Act, and therefore
our officers, directors and holders of more than 10 of our outstanding shares are subject to the provisions of Section 16(a) which requires
them to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of common stock and our other equity securities.
Officers, directors and greater than 10 beneficial owners are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a)
reports they file. Based solely on our review of the copies of reports that we received and written representations that no other reports
were required, we believe that our executive officers, directors and greater than 10 stockholders complied with all applicable filing
requirements on a timely basis during 2022.

We have not established a Nominating Committee because of our limited operations;
and because we have only three directors and two executive officers, we believe that we are able to effectively manage the issues normally
considered by a Nominating Committee. Following the entry into any business combination or the completion of any acquisition, merger or
reorganization, a further review of this issue will no doubt be necessitated and undertaken by management. 

Audit Committee 

We have not established an Audit Committee because of our limited operations;
and because we have only three directors and two executive officers, we believe that we are able to effectively manage the issues normally
considered by an Audit Committee. Following the entry into any business combination or the completion of any acquisition, merger or reorganization,
a further review of this issue will no doubt be necessitated and undertaken by management.

totaling 681,527 at December 31, 2022. Expenses of 64,478 were paid during the year ended December 31, 2022. The accrued interest related
to the outstanding loans was 798,197 as of December 31, 2022, and 662,742 as of December 31, 2021. The loans are evidenced by a promissory

the year ended December 31, 2022. Accrued interest for the year ended December 31, 2007 was immaterial and has been accrued in each of
the years ended December 31, 2008 through December 31, 2021. The note was issued by the Company on April 29, 2009 and covers all loans
made by Mirabella Holdings, LLC to the Company since November 6, 2007, as well as all loans made since that date and any such loans that
may be made by Mirabella Holdings, LLC in the future. A copy of the note was filed as an exhibit to our Annual Report for the year ended
December 31, 2008; see Part IV, Item 15 of this Report. 

Pursuant to the Management Services Agreement (the Management Services
Agreement with Richland, Gordon Company Richland ), we accrued management fees payable to Richland totaling
 120,000 during the year ended December 31, 2022, which fees, along with any other management fees that may subsequently accrue, are due
and payable to Richland if and when such an acquisition or financing is completed by the Company. 

A copy of the Management Services Agreement was filed as an exhibit to
our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2008; see Part IV, Item 15 of this Report. 

Other than the transactions pursuant to the Mirabella
Loans and the Management Services Agreement, there were no other material transactions, or series of similar transactions, during our
Company s last fiscal year, or any currently proposed transactions, or series of similar transactions, to which our Company or any
of our subsidiaries was or is to be a party, in which the amount involved exceeded the lesser of 120,000 or one percent of the average
of the small business issuer s total assets at year-end for the last three completed fiscal years and in which any director, executive
officer or any security holder who is known to us to own of record or beneficially more than five percent of any class of our common stock,
or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons, had an interest.
