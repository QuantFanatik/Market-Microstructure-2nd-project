 Reinsurance Industry Overview.
 Reinsurance 
is 
an 
arrangement 
in 
which 
an 
insurance 
company, 
the 
reinsurer, 
agrees 
to 
indemnify 
another 
 insurance or reinsurance company, 
the ceding company, 
against all or a portion of the insurance risks 
underwritten 
 by the 
ceding company 
under one 
or more 
insurance 
contracts. 
Reinsurance 
can provide 
a ceding 
company 
with 
 several 
benefits, 
including 
a 
reduction 
in 
its 
net 
liability 
on 
individual 
risks 
or 
classes 
of 
risks, 
catastrophe 
 protection from 
large and/or 
multiple losses and/or 
a reduction 
in operating 
leverage as 
measured by 
the ratio 
of 
 net premiums 
and reserves 
to capital. 
Reinsurance 
also provides 
a ceding 
company 
with additional 
underwriting 
 capacity by 
permitting it 
to accept 
larger 
risks 
and write 
more business 
than would 
be acceptable 
relative 
to 
the 
 ceding 
company s 
financial 
resources. 
Reinsurance 
does 
not 
discharge 
the 
ceding 
company 
from 
its 
liability 
to 
 policyholders; rather, 
it reimburses the ceding company 
for covered losses. 

 There 
are 
two 
basic 
types 
of reinsurance 
arrangements: 
treaty 
and facultative. 
Treaty 
reinsurance 
obligates 
the 
 ceding company 
to cede 
and the 
reinsurer to 
assume a 
specified portion 
of a 
type or 
category 
of risks 
insured 
by 
 the ceding company. 
Treaty 
reinsurers do not 
separately evaluate 
each of the individual risks 
assumed under their 
 treaties, instead, 
the reinsurer relies 
upon the pricing and 
underwriting decisions made by 
the ceding company. 
In 
 facultative 
reinsurance, 
the ceding 
company cedes 
and the 
reinsurer assumes 
all or 
part of 
the risk 
under a 
single 
 insurance contract. 
Facultative 
reinsurance 
is negotiated 
separately for 
each insurance 
contract 
that is 
reinsured. 

 Facultative 
reinsurance, 
when 
purchased 
by 
ceding 
companies, 
usually 
is 
intended 
to 
cover 
individual 
risks 
not 
 covered by their reinsurance 
treaties because of the dollar limits involved 
or because the risk is unusual. 

Both treaty 
and facultative 
reinsurance can 
be written 
on either a 
pro rata 
basis or 
an excess 
of loss 
basis. 
Under 
 pro rata reinsurance, 
the ceding company and the reinsurer 
share the premiums as well as 
the losses and expenses 
 in an 
agreed proportion. 
Under excess 
of loss 
reinsurance, 
the reinsurer 
indemnifies the 
ceding company 
against 
 all 
or 
a 
specified 
portion 
of 
losses 
and 
expenses 
in 
excess 
of 
a 
specified 
dollar 
amount, 
known 
as 
the 
ceding 
 company's retention or reinsurer's 
attachment point, generally 
subject to a negotiated reinsurance 
contract limit. 

3 

In 
pro 
rata 
reinsurance, 
the 
reinsurer 
generally 
pays 
the 
ceding 
company 
a 
ceding 
commission. 
The 
ceding 
 commission 
generally 
is 
based 
on 
the 
ceding 
company s 
cost 
of 
acquiring 
the 
business 
being 
reinsured 
 (commissions, 
premium 
taxes, 
assessments 
and 
miscellaneous 
administrative 
expense 
and 
may 
contain 
profit 
 sharing provisions, 
whereby the 
ceding commission 
is adjusted 
based on 
loss experience). 
Premiums 
paid by 
the 
 ceding company to a reinsurer 
for excess of loss reinsurance 
are not directly proportional to 
the premiums that the 
 ceding company 
receives because 
the reinsurer 
does not 
assume a 
proportionate 
risk. 
There is 
usually no 
ceding 
 commission on excess of loss reinsurance. 
 Reinsurers 
may 
purchase 
reinsurance 
to 
cover 
their 
own 
risk 
exposure. 
Reinsurance 
of a 
reinsurer's 
business 
is 
 called 
a 
retrocession. 
Reinsurance 
companies 
cede 
risks 
under 
retrocessional 
agreements 
to 
other 
reinsurers, 
 known 
as 
retrocessionaires, 
for 
reasons 
similar 
to 
those 
that 
cause 
insurers 
to 
purchase 
reinsurance: 
to 
reduce 
 net liability on 
individual or classes 
of risks, protect 
against catastrophic 
losses, stabilize 
financial ratios 
and obtain 
 additional underwriting capacity. 

 Reinsurance 
can 
be 
written 
through 
intermediaries, 
generally 
professional 
reinsurance 
brokers, 
or 
directly 
with 
 ceding 
companies. 
From 
a 
ceding 
company's 
perspective, 
the 
broker 
and 
the 
direct 
distribution 
channels 
have 
 advantages 
and disadvantages. 
A ceding company's 
decision to select 
one distribution 
channel over the 
other will 
 be influenced 
by its 
perception 
of such 
advantages 
and disadvantages 
relative 
to the 
reinsurance 
coverage 
being 
 placed. 
 Business Strategy. 
 The 
Company s 
business 
strategy 
is 
to 
sustain 
its 
leadership 
position 
within 
targeted 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
 markets,

effective 
management 
throughout 
the 
property 
and 
casualty 
underwriting 
cycle 
and 
thereby 
 achieve an 
attractive 
return for 
its stockholder. 
The Company s 
underwriting strategies 
seek to 
capitalize 
on its 
i) 
 financial 
strength 
and 
capacity, 
ii) 
global 
franchise, 
iii) 
stable 
and 
experienced 
management 
team, 
iv)

and facultative 
reinsurance and 
admitted and 
non-admitted insurance. 
The Company s 
 products 
include 
the 
full 
range 
of 
property 
and 
casualty 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
coverages, 
including

 The Company s underwriting strategies 
emphasizes underwriting profitability over 
premium volume. 
Key elements 
 of 
this 
strategy 
include 
careful 
risk 
selection, 
appropriate 
pricing 
through 
strict 
underwriting 
discipline 
and 
 adjustment 
of the 
Company s 
business mix 
in response 
to changing 
market 
conditions. 
The Company 
focuses 
on 
 reinsuring 
companies 
that 
effectively 
manage 
the 
underwriting 
cycle 
through 
proper 
analysis 
and 
appropriate 
 pricing of underlying risks and whose underwriting guidelines and 
performance are compatible with its objectives. 

 The 
Company s 
underwriting 
strategies 
emphasize 
flexibility 
and 
responsiveness 
to 
changing 
market 
conditions. 

 The 
Company 
believes 
that 
its 
existing 
strengths, 
including 
its 
broad 
underwriting 
expertise, 
global 
presence, 
 strong 
financial ratings 
and substantial 
capital, facilitate 
adjustments 
to its 
mix of 
business geographically, 
by line 
 of 
business 
and 
by 
type 
of 
coverage, 
allowing 
it 
to 
fully 
participate 
in 
market 
opportunities 
that 
provide 
the 
 greatest 
potential 
for 
underwriting 
profitability. 
The 
Company s 
insurance 
operations 
complement 
these 
 strategies 
by 
accessing business 
that is 
not available 
on a 
reinsurance 
basis. 
The Company 
carefully 
monitors 
its 
 mix of business across all operations 
to avoid unacceptable geographic 
or other risk concentrations. 

4 
 Capital Transactions. 
 The Company s 
business operations 
are in 
part dependent 
on its 
financial strength 
and financial 
strength 
ratings, 
 and the market s 
perception of 
its financial strength 
. 
The Company 
stockholder s 
equity was 
 5.7 billion and 
 7.0 
 billion 
at 
December 
31, 
2022 
and 
2021, 
respectively. 
The 
Company 
possesses 
significant 
financial 
flexibility 
with 
 access to 
the debt 
markets 
and, through 
its ultimate 
parent, 
equity markets, 
as a 
result of 
its perceived 
financial 
 strength, as evidenced by the financial strength 
ratings as assigned by independent rating 
agencies. The Company s 
 capital 
position 
remains 
strong, 
commensurate 
with 
its 
financial 
ratings 
and the 
Company 
has 
ample 
liquidity 
to 
 meet its financial obligations for the 
foreseeable future. 

 Financial Strength Ratings. 
 The 
following 
table 
shows 
the 
current 
financial 
strength 
ratings 
of 
the 
Company s 
operating 
subsidiaries 
as 
 reported by 
A.M. Best, 
S P Global 
Ratings S P 
and Moody s. 
These ratings 
represent an 
independent opinion 
 of the financial 
strength, operating 
performance, business 
profile and 
ability to meet 
policyholder obligations. 
The 
 ratings 
are 
not 
intended 
to 
be 
an 
indication 
of 
the 
degree 
or 
lack 
of 
risk 
involved 
in 
a 
direct 
or 
indirect 
equity 
 investment 
or a recommendation 
to buy, 
sell or hold 
our securities. Additionally, 
rating organizations 
may change 
 their rating methodology, 
which could have a material impact on 
our financial strength ratings. 
 All 
of 
the 
below-mentioned 
ratings 
are 
continually 
monitored 
and 
revised, 
if 
necessary, 
by 
each 
of 
the 
rating 
 agencies. 
The ratings presented in 
the following table were in 
effect as of January 31, 2023. 

 The Company 
believes that 
its ratings 
are important 
as they provide 
the Company s 
customers and 
others with 
an 
 independent 
assessment 
of 
the 
Company s 
financial 
strength 
using 
a 
rating 
scale 
that 
provides 
for 
relative 
 comparisons. 
Strong 
financial 
ratings 
are 
particularly 
important 
for 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
companies 
given 
 that customers 
rely on a company 
to pay covered 
losses well into the future. 
As a result, a highly rated 
company is 
 generally preferred.

 Competition.
 The 
worldwide 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
businesses 
are 
highly 
competitive, 
as 
well 
as 
cyclical 
by 
product 
and 
 market. 
As 
such, 
financial 
results 
tend 
to 
fluctuate 
with 
periods 
of 
constrained 
availability, 
higher 
rates 
and 
 stronger 
profits followed 
by periods 
of abundant 
capacity, 
lower rates 
and constrained 
profitability. 
Competition 
 in 
the 
types 
of 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
business 
that 
we 
underwrite 
is 
based 
on 
many 
factors, 
including 
the 
 perceived 
overall 
financial 
strength 
of 
the 
reinsurer 
or 
insurer, 
ratings 
of 
the 
reinsurer 
or 
insurer 
by 
A.M. 
Best 
 and/or 
Standard 
 
Poor s, 
underwriting 
expertise, 
the 
jurisdictions 
where 
the 
reinsurer 
or 
insurer 
is 
licensed 
or 
 otherwise 
authorized, 
capacity 
and 
coverages 
offered, 
premiums 
charged, 
other 
terms 
and 
conditions 
of 
the 
 reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
business 
offered, 
services 
offered, 
speed 
of 
claims 
payment 
and 
reputation 
and 
 experience in lines written. 
Furthermore, the market impact 
from these competitive factors 
related to reinsurance 
 and 
insurance 
is 
generally 
not 
consistent 
across 
lines 
of business, 
domestic 
and 
international 
geographical 
areas 
 and distribution channels. 

 We 
compete 
in the 
U.S. and 
international 
reinsurance 
and insurance 
markets 
with numerous 
global competitors. 
 Our 
competitors 
include 
independent 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
companies, 
subsidiaries 
or 
affiliates 
of 
 established 
worldwide 
insurance 
companies, 
reinsurance 
departments 
of certain 
insurance 
companies, 
domestic 
 and 
international 
underwriting 
operations, 
and 
certain 
government 
sponsored 
risk 
transfer 
vehicles. 
Some 
of 
 these 
competitors 
have 
greater 
financial 
resources 
than 
we 
do 
and 
have 
established 
long-term 
and 
continuing 
 business relationships, 
which can be a 
significant competitive 
advantage. 
In addition, the lack 
of strong barriers 
to 
 entry 
into 
the 
reinsurance 
business 
and 
the 
securitization 
of 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
risks 
through 
capital 
 markets provide additional 
sources of potential reinsurance 
and insurance capacity and competition. 

 Worldwide 
insurance 
and 
reinsurance 
market 
conditions 
historically 
have 
been 
competitive. 
Generally, 
there 
is 
 ample 
insurance 
and 
reinsurance 
capacity 
relative 
to 
demand, 
as 
well 
as, 
additional 
capital 
from 
the 
capital 
 markets through 
insurance linked 
financial instruments. 
These financial instruments 
such as side cars, 
catastrophe 
 bonds and collateralized 
reinsurance funds, 
provided capital 
markets with 
access to insurance 
and reinsurance 
risk 
 exposure. 
The capital 
markets 
demand for 
these products 
is primarily 
driven by 
the desire 
to achieve 
greater 
risk 
 diversification 
and 
potentially 
higher 
returns 
on 
their 
investments. 
This 
competition 
generally 
has 
a 
negative 
 impact 
on 
rates, 
terms 
and 
conditions; 
however, 
the 
impact 
varies 
widely 
by 
market 
and 
coverage. 
Based 
on 
 recent 
competitive 
behaviors 
in 
the 
insurance 
and 
reinsurance 
industry, 
natural 
catastrophe 
events 
and 
the 
 macroeconomic 
backdrop, 
there 
has 
been 
some 
dislocation 
in 
the 
market 
which 
we 
expect 
to 
have 
a 
positive 
 impact on rates and terms and conditions 
generally, 
though local market specificities can 
vary. 
 The increased frequency of 
catastrophe 
losses experienced throughout 
2022 appears to be pressuring 
the increase 
 of 
rates. 
As 
business 
activity 
continues 
to 
regain 
strength 
after 
the 
pandemic 
and 
current 
macroeconomic 
 uncertainty, 
rates 
also 
appear 
to 
be 
firming 
in 
most 
lines 
of 
business, 
particularly 
in 
the 
casualty 
lines 
that 
had 
 seen 
significant 
losses 
such 
as 
excess 
casualty 
and 
directors 
and 
officers 
liability. 
Other 
casualty 
lines 
are 
 experiencing 
modest 
rate 
increase, 
while 
some 
lines 
such 
as 
workers 
compensation 
were 
experiencing 
softer 
 market 
conditions. 
It 
is 
too 
early 
to 
tell 
what 
the 
impact 
on 
pricing 
conditions 
will 
be 
but 
it 
is 
likely 
to 
change 
 depending on the line of business and geography.

 The war 
in the 
Ukraine 
is ongoing 
and an 
evolving 
event. 
Economic 
and legal 
sanctions 
have 
been levied 
against 
 Russia, specific named individuals 
and entities connected 
to the Russian government, 
as well as businesses 
located 
 in the 
Russian Federation 
and/or owned 
by Russian 
nationals by 
numerous countries, 
including the 
United States. 
 The 
significant 
political 
and 
economic 
uncertainty 
surrounding 
the 
war 
and 
associated 
sanctions 
have 
impacted 
 economic 
and 
investment 
markets 
both 
within 
Russia 
and 
around 
the 
world. 
The 
Company 
has 
recorded 
 25 
 million of losses related to the Ukraine/Russia 
war during 2022. 
 Human Capital Management. 

 Our employees 
are essential 
to the 
success of 
our business, 
and so 
we strive 
to attract 
and retain 
a high 
standard 
 of 
insurance 
professionals 
to 
meet 
our 
business 
needs 
as 
well 
as 
the 
needs 
of 
our 
clients 
and 
customers. 
As 
of 
 February 1, 2023, 
the Company employed 
1,933 persons. 
Management believes 
that employee relations 
are good. 
 None of the Company s 
employees are subject 
to collective bargaining 
agreements, and the 
Company is not 
aware 
 of any current efforts 
to implement such agreements. 

 Everest is 
committed to providing 
our employees with an engaging 
and supportive environment 
so that employees 
 can develop 
personally and 
help us achieve 
success as 
an organization. 
We consider 
the ability 
to attract, 
develop 
 and 
retain 
a 
high 
caliber 
of 
insurance 
professionals 
to 
be 
critical 
to 
our 
success. 
Opportunities 
for 
continued 
 learning 
and 
talent 
development 
are 
provided 
to 
all 
employee 
levels. 
Employees 
are 
encouraged 
to 
take 
 ownership 
of 
their 
development 
by 
using 
the 
tools 
that 
the 
Company 
has 
made 
available 
to 
them 
including 
 industry 
training, 
mentorships 
and 
personal 
development 
classes. 
Everest 
actively 
manages 
succession 
planning 
 throughout 
our organization 
and strives 
to provide 
job growth 
and advancement 
opportunities to 
internal talent, 
 where possible. 
 Diversity and Inclusion. 
 Our strength 
and success 
derive 
from our 
diversity, 
and we 
are 
at 
our best 
when we 
embrace 
diverse 
views 
and 
 perspectives. 
Equality 
in 
opportunity, 
career 
development, 
compensation 
and 
respect 
for 
all 
individuals 
are 
 fundamental human rights that are 
at the forefront 
of our culture and promoted not 
only within our workplace but 
 also the 
global communities 
in which 
we operate. 
Our Board 
is committed 
to diversity 
within its 
structure 
as well 
 as 
emphasizing 
its 
importance 
in 
our 
senior 
executive 
leadership. 
We 
believe 
that 
diversity 
in 
gender, 
age, 
 ethnicity 
and 
skill 
set 
allows 
for 
dynamic 
and 
evolving 
perspectives 
in 
governance, 
strategy, 
corporate 
 responsibility, 
human rights and risk management. 

Proactive diversity 
recruitment is 
an integral 
aspect of succession 
planning at both 
the board level 
and throughout 
 all 
levels 
in 
the 
organization. 
Our 
Talent 
Development 
team 
works 
with 
senior 
management 
to 
identify 
women 
 and 
persons 
of 
color 
across 
the 
Company 
as 
potential 
leaders. 
These 
individuals 
are 
provided 
management 
and 
 executive leadership 
training and 
education to 
enhance their skillsets 
and provide 
opportunities for 
advancement. 
 Indeed, our 
executive 
officers 
are 
measured 
on their 
forward-thinking 
diversity 
initiatives 
as part 
of their 
annual 
 performance evaluations. 
Such diversity 
at the 
most senior 
levels of 
our organization 
reflects our 
commitment to 
 identify and develop highly qualified women and individuals 
of color to help lead our Company into 
the future. 

 The 
work 
of 
the 
DEI 
Council 
has 
helped 
enhance 
the 
employee 
experience 
for 
all 
our 
colleagues 
across 
the 
 organization 
worldwide. 
The 
council 
encourages 
continuous 
and 
open 
dialogue 
between 
executive 
and 
senior 
 management 
and 
traditionally 
underrepresented 
groups 
at 
all 
levels, 
without 
fear 
of 
reprisal 
or 
retaliation, 
to 
 identify 
areas 
of 
improvement 
and

out 
the 
message 
of 
inclusion 
both 
inside 
and 
outside

 ITEM 1A. 
RISK FACTORS
 In addition 
to the 
other information 
provided 
in this 
report, the 
following risk 
factors 
should be 
considered when 
 evaluating 
an 
investment 
in 
our 
securities. 
If 
the 
circumstances 
contemplated 
by 
the 
individual 
risk 
factors 
 materialize, 
our business, 
financial condition 
and results 
of operations 
could be 
materially 
and adversely 
affected 
 and our ability to service our debt, our debt ratings 
and our ability to issue new debt could decline significantly. 
 RISKS RELATING TO 
OUR BUSINESS 
 Our results could be adversely affected by catastrophic 
events. 
 We 
are 
exposed 
to 
unpredictable 
catastrophic 
events, 
including weather 
-related 
and other 
natural 
catastrophes, 
 as well as acts of 
terrorism. The frequency and/or 
severity of catastrophic 
events may be impacted 
in the future by 
 the continued 
effects of 
climate change. 
Any material 
reduction in 
our operating 
results caused 
by the occurrence 
 of 
one 
or 
more 
catastrophes 
could 
inhibit 
our 
ability 
to 
pay 
dividends 
or 
to 
meet 
our 
interest 
and 
principal 
 payment obligations. 
By way 
of illustration, 
during the past 
five calendar 
years, pre 
-tax catastrophe 
losses, net 
of 
 reinsurance, were as follows: 

 Calendar year: 
 Pre-tax net catastrophe losses 
 (Dollars in millions) 
 2022 
 
 984 
 2021 
 940 
 2020 
 397 
 2019 
 574 
 2018 
 1,713 
 Our losses from future catastrophic events 
could exceed our projections. 
 We 
use 
projections 
of 
possible 
losses 
from 
future 
catastrophic 
events 
of 
varying 
types 
and 
magnitudes 
as 
a 
 strategic 
underwriting tool. 
We use 
these loss 
projections to 
estimate our 
potential catastrophe 
losses in 
certain 
 geographic 
areas 
and decide 
on the 
placement 
of retrocessional 
coverage 
or other 
actions 
to 
limit the 
extent 
of 
 potential 
losses 
in 
a 
given 
geographic 
area. 
These 
loss 
projections 
are 
approximations, 
reliant 
on 
a 
mix 
of 
 quantitative 
and 
qualitative 
processes, 
and 
actual 
losses 
may 
exceed 
the 
projections 
by 
a 
material 
amount, 
 resulting in a material adverse effect 
on our financial condition and results of operations. 

 If our loss 
reserves are inadequate 
to meet our 
actual losses, our 
net income 
would be reduced 
or we could 
incur a 
 loss. 
 We 
are 
required 
to 
maintain 
reserves 
to 
cover 
our 
estimated 
ultimate 
liability 
of 
losses 
and 
loss 
adjustment 
 expenses LAE for 
both reported and 
unreported claims incurred. 
These reserves are only 
estimates of what we 
 believe 
the 
settlement 
and 
administration 
of claims 
will 
cost 
based 
on 
facts 
and circumstances 
known 
to 
us. 
In 
 setting reserves for 
our reinsurance liabilities, 
we rely on claim 
data supplied by 
our ceding companies and brokers 
 and we 
employ 
actuarial 
and statistical 
projections. 
The information 
received 
from 
our 
ceding companies 
is not 
 always 
timely 
or 
accurate, 
which 
can 
contribute 
to 
inaccuracies 
in 
our 
loss 
projections. 
Because 
of 
the 
 uncertainties that 
surround 
our estimates 
of loss 
and LAE 
reserves, we 
cannot be 
certain that 
ultimate losses 
and 
 LAE payments 
will not 
exceed 
our estimates. 
If our 
reserves are 
deficient, we 
would be 
required to 
increase loss 

8 
 reserves in 
the period 
in which 
such deficiencies 
are identified 
which would 
cause a 
charge to 
our earnings 
and a 
 reduction of 
capital. During 
the past 
five calendar 
years, 
the reserve 
re-estimation 
process 
resulted in 
a decrease 
 to our pre-tax net income in all five 
years:

 The 
difficulty 
in 
estimating 
our 
reserves 
is 
significantly 
more 
challenging 
as 
it 
relates 
to 
reserving 
for 
potential 
 asbestos and 
environmental A E 
liabilities. 
At December 31, 
2022, 1.9 of our 
gross reserves were 
comprised 
 of 
A E 
reserves. 
A E 
liabilities 
are 
especially 
hard 
to 
estimate 
for 
many 
reasons, 
including 
the 
long 
delays 
 between exposure and manifestation 
of any bodily injury or property damage, 
difficulty in identifying the source of 
 the asbestos or 
environmental contamination, 
long reporting delays 
and difficulty in properly 
allocating liability for 
 the asbestos 
or environmental 
damage. 
Legal tactics 
and judicial and 
legislative developments 
affecting the 
scope 
 of 
insurers 
liability, 
which 
can 
be 
difficult 
to 
predict, 
also 
contribute 
to 
uncertainties 
in 
estimating 
reserves 
for 
 A E liabilities. 

 The 
failure 
to 
accurately 
assess 
underwriting 
risk 
and 
establish 
adequate 
premium 
rates 
could 
reduce 
our 
net 
 income or result in a net loss. 
 Our success depends on our ability to accurately 
assess the risks associated with the businesses 
on which the risk is 
 retained. 
If we 
fail 
to 
accurately 
assess 
the risks 
we retain, 
we 
may 
fail 
to 
establish 
adequate 
premium 
rates 
to 
 cover our losses and LAE. 
This could reduce our net income and even result 
in a net loss. 

 In 
addition, 
losses 
may 
arise from 
events 
or 
exposures 
that 
are 
not 
anticipated 
when 
the 
coverage 
is 
priced. 
In 
 addition to 
unanticipated 
events, 
we also 
face the 
unanticipated 
expansion 
of our 
exposures, 
particularly in 
long-
 tail liability 
lines. 
An example 
of this 
is the 
expansion 
over time 
of the 
scope of 
insurers 
legal liability 
within the 
 mass tort arena, particularly for A E exposures 
discussed above. 

 Decreases in pricing for property and casualty reinsurance 
and insurance could reduce our net income. 
 The 
worldwide 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
businesses 
are 
highly 
competitive, 
as 
well 
as 
cyclical 
by 
product 
and 
 market. 
These 
cycles, 
as 
well 
as 
other 
factors 
that 
influence 
aggregate 
supply 
and 
demand 
for 
property 
and 
 casualty 
insurance 
and reinsurance 
products, 
are outside 
of our 
control. 
The supply 
of (re)insurance 
is driven 
by 
 prevailing 
prices 
and 
levels 
of 
capacity 
that 
may 
fluctuate 
in 
response 
to 
a 
number 
of 
factors 
including 
large 
 catastrophic 
losses 
and investment 
returns 
being 
realized 
in 
the 
insurance 
industry. 
Demand 
for 
(re)insurance 
is 
 influenced 
by 
underwriting 
results 
of 
insurers 
and 
insureds, 
including 
catastrophe 
losses, 
and 
prevailing 
general 
 economic 
conditions. 
If 
any 
of 
these 
factors 
were 
to 
result 
in 
a 
decline 
in 
the 
demand 
for 
(re)insurance 
or 
an 
 overall increase in (re)insurance 
capacity, our 
net income could decrease. 
 If rating agencies downgrade 
the ratings of our insurance 
subsidiaries, future prospects 
for growth and profitability 
 could be significantly and adversely affected. 
 Our active 
insurance 
company 
subsidiaries 
currently 
hold financial 
strength 
ratings 
assigned by 
third-party 
rating 
 agencies which assess and 
rate the claims paying 
ability and financial strength 
of insurers and 
reinsurers. 
Financial 
 strength 
ratings 
are 
used 
by 
cedents, 
agents 
and 
brokers 
to 
assess 
the 
financial 
strength 
and 
credit 
quality 
of 
 reinsurers 
and 
insurers. 
A 
downgrade 
or 
withdrawal 
of 
any 
of 
these 
ratings 
could 
adversely 
affect 
our 
ability 
to 
 market 
our 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
products, 
our 
ability 
to 
compete 
with 
other 
reinsurers 
and 
insurers, 
and 

9 
 could 
have 
a 
material 
and 
adverse 
effect 
on 
our 
ability 
to 
write 
new 
business 
that 
in 
turn 
could 
impact 
our 
 profitability 
and 
operating 
results. 
In 
December 
2021, 
S P 
announced 
proposed 
changes 
to 
its 
rating 
 methodologies. The proposed 
changes have 
not been finalized, 
so the impact, 
if any, 
that these changes 
may have 
 on our financial strength ratings 
is unknown. 
 Consistent with 
market practice, 
much of our 
treaty reinsurance 
business allows 
the ceding company 
to terminate 
 the 
contract 
or 
seek 
collateralization 
of 
our 
obligations 
in 
the 
event 
of 
a 
rating 
downgrade 
below 
a 
certain 
 threshold. The 
termination provision 
would generally 
be triggered 
if a 
rating fell 
below A.M. 
Best s 
A- rating 
level. 
 To 
a 
lesser 
extent, 
Everest 
Re 
also 
has 
modest 
exposure 
to 
reinsurance 
contracts 
that 
contain 
provisions 
for 
 obligatory funding of outstanding 
liabilities in the event of a rating 
agency downgrade. Those 
provisions 
would also 
 generally be triggered if Everest 
Re s rating 
fell below A.M. Best s A- rating 
level. 
 The failure of our insureds, intermediaries and reinsurers to 
satisfy their obligations to us could reduce our income. 
 In 
accordance 
with 
industry 
practice, 
we 
have 
uncollateralized 
receivables 
from 
insureds, 
agents 
and 
brokers 
 and/or 
rely 
on 
agents 
and 
brokers 
to 
process 
our 
payments. 
We 
may 
not 
be 
able 
to 
collect 
amounts 
due 
from 
 insureds, agents and brokers, 
resulting in a reduction to net income. 
 We are 
subject to 
credit risk 
of reinsurers 
in connection 
with retrocessional 
arrangements 
because the transfer 
of 
 risk to a 
reinsurer does 
not relieve 
us of our 
liability to the 
insured. In 
addition, reinsurers 
may be unwilling 
to pay 
 us even though they 
are able to do so. 
The failure of one or 
more of our reinsurers 
to honor their obligations 
to us 
 in a timely fashion 
would impact our cash 
flow and reduce our 
net income and could 
cause us to 
incur a significant 
 loss. 

 If we are unable or choose not to purchase reinsurance 
and transfer risk to the reinsurance 
markets, our net income 
 could be reduced or we could incur a net loss in the event 
of unusual loss experience.
 We are 
generally less 
reliant on 
the purchase 
of reinsurance 
than many 
of our competitors, 
in part because 
of our 
 strategic 
emphasis on 
underwriting discipline 
and management 
of the 
cycles inherent 
in our 
business. 
We 
try to 
 separate 
our risk 
taking process 
from our 
risk mitigation 
process in 
order to 
avoid developing 
too great 
a reliance 
 on 
reinsurance. 
With 
the 
expansion 
of 
the 
capital 
markets 
into 
insurance 
linked 
financial 
instruments, 
we 
 increased our 
use of capital 
market products 
for catastrophe 
reinsurance. 
In addition, we 
have increased 
some of 
 our 
quota 
share 
contracts 
with 
larger 
retrocessions. 
The 
percentage 
of 
business 
that 
we 
reinsure 
may 
vary 
 considerably 
from year 
to year, 
depending on 
our view 
of the 
relationship between 
cost and 
expected benefit 
for 
 the contract period.

 Our industry is highly competitive and we may not be able 
to compete as successfully in the future. 
 Our industry 
is highly 
competitive 
and subject 
to 
pricing cycles 
that 
can 
be pronounced. 
We 
compete 
globally in 
 the United 
States, 
international 
reinsurance 
and insurance 
markets 
with numerous 
competitors. 
Our competitors 
 include 
independent 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
companies, 
subsidiaries 
or 
affiliates 
of 
established 
worldwide 
 insurance 
companies, 
reinsurance 
departments 
of 
certain 
insurance 
companies 
and 
domestic 
and 
international 
 underwriting operations, including underwriting syndicates 
at Lloyd s 
of London. 
 According 
to S P, 
Group ranks 
among the 
top ten 
global reinsurance 
groups, 
where more 
than two-thirds 
of the 
 market 
share 
is 
concentrated. 
The worldwide 
net 
premium 
written 
by 
the 
Top 
40 global 
reinsurance 
groups, 
for 
 both 
life 
and 
non-life 
business, 
was 
estimated 
to 
be 
 274 billion 
in 
2020 
according 
to 
data 
compiled 
by 
S P. 
In 

10 
 addition to competitors, 
the entry of alternative 
capital market products 
and vehicles provide additional 
sources of 
 reinsurance and insurance 
capacity. 

 We are dependent on our key 
personnel. 
 Our success 
has been, 
and will 
continue 
to be, 
dependent on 
our ability 
to retain 
the services 
of our 
existing key 
 executives and 
other key employees, 
and to attract 
and retain additional qualified 
personnel in the future. The 
loss 
 of the services of 
any key 
executive officer 
or the inability to 
hire and retain 
other highly qualified personnel 
in the 
 future, 
particularly 
those 
experienced 
in 
the 
property 
and casualty 
industry, 
could 
adversely 
affect 
our 
ability 
to 
 conduct business. 

 Our investment 
values and 
investment 
income could 
decline because 
they are 
exposed 
to interest 
rate, credit 
and 
 market risks.
 A significant 
portion of our 
investment 
portfolio consists 
of fixed 
income securities 
and smaller portions 
consist of 
 equity 
securities 
and 
other 
investments. 
Both 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
our 
invested 
assets 
and 
associated 
investment 
 income 
fluctuate 
depending 
on 
general 
economic 
and 
market 
conditions. 
For 
example, 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
our 
 predominant fixed income portfolio 
generally increases or decreases 
inversely to fluctuations 
in interest rates. 
The 
 fair 
value 
of our 
fixed 
income 
securities 
could 
also decrease 
as a 
result 
of a 
downturn 
in 
the 
business 
cycle 
that 
 causes the 
credit quality 
of such securities 
to deteriorate. 
The net investment 
income that 
we realize 
from future 
 investments in fixed income 
securities will generally increase or decrease 
with interest rates. 

 Interest 
rate 
fluctuations 
also 
can 
cause 
net 
investment 
income 
from 
fixed 
income 
investments 
that 
carry 
 prepayment 
risk, 
such 
as 
mortgage-backed 
and 
other 
asset-backed 
securities, 
to 
differ 
from 
the 
income 
 anticipated 
from 
those 
securities 
at 
the 
time 
of 
purchase. 
In 
addition, 
if 
issuers 
of 
individual 
investments 
are 
 unable to meet their obligations, investment 
income will be reduced and realized capital 
losses may arise. 
 The 
majority 
of our 
fixed 
income 
securities 
are 
classified 
as 
available 
for 
sale 
and 
temporary 
changes 
in 
the 
fair 
 value 
of 
these 
investments 
are 
reflected 
as 
changes 
to 
our 
stockholder s 
equity. 
Our 
actively 
managed 
equity 
 security portfolios 
are fair valued 
and any changes 
in fair value 
are reflected 
as net realized 
capital gains 
or losses. 

 As a result, a decline in the value of our securities reduces our 
capital or could cause us to incur a loss. 

 As 
a 
part 
of our 
ongoing 
analysis 
of our 
investment 
portfolio, 
we 
are 
required 
to 
assess 
current 
expected 
credit 
 losses for 
all held-to-maturity 
securities and 
evaluate 
expected 
credit losses 
for available 
-for-sale securities 
when 
 fair 
value 
is 
below 
amortized 
cost, 
which 
considers 
reasonable 
and 
supportable 
forecasts 
of 
future 
economic 
 conditions in addition to information 
about past events and current 
conditions. This analysis requires 
a high degree 
 of judgment. Financial assets with similar risk characteristics 
and relevant historical loss 
information are included in 
 the development 
of an estimate 
of expected 
lifetime losses. 
Declines in relevant 
stock and 
other financial markets 
 and other 
factors 
impacting the 
value of 
our investments 
could result 
in an 
adverse effect 
on our 
net income 
and 

 other financial results. 
 We 
have 
invested 
a 
portion of 
our 
investment 
portfolio 
in 
equity securities. 
The value 
of these 
assets 
fluctuates 
 with changes 
in the 
markets. In 
times of 
economic weakness, 
the fair 
value of 
these assets 
may decline, 
and may 
 negatively 
impact 
net 
income. 
We 
also 
invest 
in 
non-traditional 
investments 
which 
have 
different 
risk 
 characteristics 
than 
traditional 
fixed 
income 
and 
equity 
securities. 
These 
alternative 
investments 
are 
comprised 
 primarily 
of 
private 
equity 
limited 
partnerships. 
The 
changes 
in 
value 
and 
investment 
income/(loss) 
for 
these 
 partnerships may be more volatile 
than over-the-counter securities. 
 Prolonged 
and 
severe 
disruptions 
in 
the 
overall 
public 
and private 
debt 
and 
equity 
markets, 
such 
as occurred 
in 
 early 
2020 
related 
to 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic, 
could 
result 
in 
significant 
realized 
and 
unrealized 
losses 
in 
our 
 investment 
portfolio. 
There 
could 
also be 
disruption 
in individual 
market 
sectors, 
such as 
occurred 
in the 
energy 
 sector 
in 
recent 
years. 
Such 
declines 
in 
the 
financial 
markets 
could 
result 
in 
significant 
realized 
and 
unrealized 

11 
 losses on investments 
and could have 
a material adverse 
impact on our 
results of operations, 
equity, 
business and 
 insurer financial strength and debt 
ratings. 

 We may experience 
foreign currency exchange losses that 
reduce our net income and capital levels. 
 Through our 
international operations, 
we conduct business 
in a variety 
of foreign 
(non-U.S.) currencies, 
principally 
 the 
Canadian 
dollar 
and 
the 
Singapore 
dollar. 
Assets, 
liabilities, 
revenues 
and 
expenses 
denominated 
in 
foreign 
 currencies 
are 
exposed 
to 
changes 
in 
currency 
exchange 
rates. 
Our 
reporting 
currency 
is 
the 
U.S. 
dollar, 
and 
 exchange 
rate 
fluctuations, 
especially 
relative 
to 
the 
U.S. 
dollar, 
may 
materially 
impact 
our 
results 
and 
financial 
 position. 
In 
2022, 
we 
wrote 
approximately 
15.2 
of 
our 
coverages 
in 
non-U.S. 
currencies; 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
 2022, 
we 
maintained 
approximately 
8.8 
of 
our 
investment 
portfolio 
in 
investments 
denominated 
in 
non-U.S. 
 currencies. 
During 
2022, 
2021 
and 
2020, 
the 
impact 
on 
our 
quarterly 
pre-tax 
net 
income 
from 
exchange 
rate 
 fluctuations ranged from a loss 
of 11 million to a gain of 11 million. 
 We are subject to cybersecurity risks 
that could negatively impact our business operations. 

 We 
are 
dependent 
upon 
our 
information 
technology 
platform, 
including 
our 
processing 
systems, 
data 
and 
 electronic transmissions 
in our business operations. 
Security breaches could expose 
us to the loss or misuse 
of our 
 information, 
litigation 
and 
potential 
liability. 
In 
addition, 
cyber 
incidents 
that 
impact 
the 
availability, 
reliability, 
 speed, 
accuracy 
or 
other 
proper 
functioning 
of 
these 
systems 
could 
have 
a 
significant 
negative 
impact 
on 
our 
 operations 
and 
possibly 
our 
results. 
An 
incident 
could 
also 
result 
in 
a 
violation 
of 
applicable 
privacy 
and 
other 
 laws, damage 
our reputation, 
cause a 
loss of 
customers 
or give 
rise to 
monetary fines 
and other 
penalties, which 
 could be 
significant. 
Management is 
not aware 
of a 
cybersecurity incident 
that has 
had a 
material impact 
on our 
 operations. 

 The 
NAIC 
has 
adopted 
an 
Insurance 
Data 
Security 
Model 
Law, 
which, 
when 
adopted 
by 
the 
states 
will 
require 
 insurers, insurance 
producers and other 
entities required to 
be licensed under state 
insurance laws to 
comply with 
 certain 
requirements 
under 
state 
insurance 
laws, 
such 
as 
developing 
and 
maintaining 
a 
written 
information 
 security 
program, 
conducting 
risk assessments 
and overseeing 
the data 
security 
practices 
of third 
-party 
vendors. 

 In 
addition, 
certain 
state 
insurance 
regulators 
are 
developing 
or 
have 
developed 
regulations 
that 
may 
impose 
 regulatory 
requirements 
relating 
to 
cybersecurity 
on 
insurance 
and 
reinsurance 
companies 
(potentially 
including 
 insurance and reinsurance 
companies that are 
not domiciled, but are 
licensed, in the relevant 
state). 
For example, 
 the 
New 
York 
State 
Department 
of Financial 
Services 
has 
a 
regulation 
pertaining 
to 
cybersecurity 
for 
all 
banking 
 and 
insurance 
entities 
under 
its 
jurisdiction, 
which 
was 
effective 
as 
of 
March 
1, 
2017, 
which 
applies 
to 
us. 
We 
 cannot 
predict 
the 
impact 
these 
laws 
and 
regulations 
will 
have 
on 
our 
business, 
financial 
condition 
or 
results 
of 
 operations, 
but our 
insurance 
and reinsurance 
companies 
could 
incur additional 
costs 
resulting 
from 
compliance 
 with such laws and regulations. 

RISKS RELATING TO 
REGULATION 
 Insurance laws and regulations restrict our ability to 
operate and any failure to comply with 
those laws and 
 regulations could have a material adverse effect on our 
business. 
 We 
are 
subject 
to 
extensive 
and 
increasing 
regulation 
under 
U.S., 
state 
and 
foreign 
insurance 
laws. 
These 
laws 
 limit 
the 
amount 
of 
dividends 
that 
can 
be 
paid 
to 
us 
by 
our 
operating 
subsidiaries, 
impose 
restrictions 
on 
the 
 amount and 
type of 
investments 
that we 
can hold, 
prescribe solvency, 
accounting 
and internal 
control 
standards 
 that 
must 
be 
met 
and 
maintained 
and 
require 
us 
to 
maintain 
reserves. 
These 
laws 
also 
require 
disclosure 
of 
 material 
inter-affiliate 
transactions 
and 
require 
prior 
approval 
of 
 extraordinary 
transactions. 
Such 
 extraordinary 
transactions 
include 
declaring 
dividends 
from 
operating 
subsidiaries 
that 
exceed 
statutory 
 thresholds. 
These 
laws 
also 
generally 
require 
approval 
of 
changes 
of 
control 
of 
insurance 
companies. 
The 
 application 
of 
these 
laws 
could 
affect 
our 
liquidity 
and 
ability 
to 
pay 
dividends, 
interest 
and 
other 
payments 
on 
 securities, 
as 
applicable, 
and could 
restrict 
our 
ability 
to 
expand 
our 
business 
operations 
through 
acquisitions 
of 
 new insurance 
subsidiaries. 
We may 
not have 
or maintain 
all required 
licenses and approvals 
or fully comply 
with 

12 
 the 
wide 
variety 
of 
applicable 
laws 
and 
regulations 
or 
the 
relevant 
authority s 
interpretation 
of 
the 
laws 
and 
 regulations. 
If we 
do 
not 
have 
the 
requisite 
licenses 
and approvals 
or 
do 
not comply 
with 
applicable 
regulatory 
 requirements, 
the 
insurance 
regulatory 
authorities 
could 
preclude 
or 
temporarily 
suspend 
us 
from 
carrying 
on 
 some or all 
of our activities 
or monetarily penalize 
us. 
These types of 
actions could have 
a material 
adverse effect 
 on our business. 
To date, 
no material fine, penalty or restriction 
has been imposed on us for failure 
to comply with 
 any insurance law or regulation. 
 As 
a 
result 
of 
the 
previous 
dislocation 
of 
the 
financial 
markets, 
Congress 
and 
the 
previous 
Presidential 
 administration 
in 
the 
United 
States 
implemented 
changes 
in 
the 
way 
the 
financial 
services 
industry 
is regulated. 

 Some of 
these changes 
are also 
impacting the 
insurance industry. 
For example, 
the U.S. 
Treasury 
established the 
 Federal 
Insurance 
Office 
with 
the authority 
to 
monitor 
all aspects 
of the 
insurance 
sector, 
monitor 
the extent 
to 
 which 
traditionally 
underserved 
communities 
and 
consumers 
have 
access 
to 
affordable 
non-health 
insurance 
 products, 
to 
represent 
the 
United 
States 
on 
prudential 
aspects 
of international 
insurance 
matters, 
to 
assist 
with 
 administration 
of 
the 
Terrorism 
Risk 
Insurance 
Program 
and 
to 
advise 
on 
important 
national 
and 
international 
 insurance 
matters. 
In 
addition, 
several 
European 
regulatory 
bodies 
are 
in 
process 
of 
updating 
existing 
or 
 developing 
new 
capital 
adequacy 
directives 
for 
insurers 
and 
reinsurers. 
The 
future 
impact 
of 
such 
initiatives 
or 
 new 
initiatives 
from 
the 
current 
Government 
Administration, 
if 
any, 
on 
our 
operation, 
net 
income 
(loss) 
or 
 financial condition cannot be determined at this 
time. 

 RISK RELATING TO 
OUR SECURITIES 
 Because of 
our holding 
company 
structure, our 
ability to 
pay dividends, 
interest 
and principal 
is dependent 
on our 
 receipt of dividends, loan payments and other funds from our subsidiaries. 
 We are 
a holding 
company, 
whose most 
significant asset 
consists 
of the 
stock of 
our operating 
subsidiaries. 
As a 
 result, 
our ability 
to pay 
dividends, interest 
or other 
payments 
on our 
securities in 
the future 
will depend 
on the 
 earnings 
and 
cash 
flows 
of 
the 
operating 
subsidiaries 
and 
the 
ability 
of 
the 
subsidiaries 
to 
pay 
dividends 
or 
to 
 advance 
or 
repay 
funds 
to 
us. 
This 
ability 
is 
subject 
to 
general 
economic, 
financial, 
competitive, 
regulatory 
and 
 other factors beyond 
our control. Payment 
of dividends and advances 
and repayments from 
some of the operating 
 subsidiaries are 
regulated by 
U.S., state 
and foreign 
insurance laws 
and regulatory 
restrictions, including 
minimum 
 solvency 
and 
liquidity 
thresholds. 
Accordingly, 
the 
operating 
subsidiaries 
may 
not 
be 
able 
to 
pay 
dividends 
or 
 advance 
or 
repay 
funds 
to 
us 
in 
the 
future, 
which 
could 
prevent 
us 
from 
paying 
dividends, 
interest 
or 
other 
 payments on our securities. 
 RISK RELATING TO 
TAXATION 
 If U.S. tax law changes, our net income 
may be impacted. 
 The 2017 TCJA 
addressed what 
some members 
of Congress 
had expressed 
concern about 
for several 
years, which 
 was 
U.S. 
corporations 
moving 
their 
place 
of 
incorporation 
to 
low-tax 
jurisdictions 
to 
obtain 
a 
competitive 
 advantage over 
domestic corporations 
that are subject to 
the U.S. corporate 
income tax rate 
of 21 . Specifically, 
it 
 addressed 
their 
concern 
over 
a 
perceived 
competitive 
advantage 
that 
foreign-controlled 
insurers 
and 
reinsurers 
 may 
have 
had 
over 
U.S. 
controlled 
insurers 
and 
reinsurers 
resulting 
from 
the 
purchase 
of 
reinsurance 
by 
U.S. 
 insurers 
from 
affiliates 
operating 
in 
some 
foreign 
jurisdictions, 
including 
Bermuda. 
Such 
affiliated 
reinsurance 
 transactions 
may 
subject 
the 
U.S. 
ceding 
companies 
to 
a Base 
Erosion 
and 
Anti-abuse 
Tax BEAT 
of 10 
from 
 2019 to 2025 and 12.5 thereafter 
which may exceed its 
regular income tax. 
In addition, new legislation as well as 
 proposed and final regulations may 
further limit the ability of the Company 
to execute alternative 
capital balancing 
 transactions with unrelated parties. 
This would further impact our net income and effective 
tax rate. 

 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction 
Act of 2022 IRA was enacted. We 
have evaluated 
the tax provisions 
 of 
the 
IRA, 
the 
most 
significant 
of 
which 
are 
the 
corporate 
alternative 
minimum 
tax 
and 
the 
share 
repurchase 
 excise tax and do not expect 
the legislation to have a material 
impact on our results of operations. As the 
IRS issues 
 additional guidance, we will evaluate any 
impact to our consolidated financial statements.

 ITEM 3. 
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 In the ordinary 
course of business, 
the Company is 
involved in 
lawsuits, arbitrations 
and other formal 
and informal 
 dispute resolution 
procedures, 
the outcomes 
of which 
will determine 
the Company s 
rights and 
obligations 
under 
 insurance 
and 
reinsurance 
agreements. 
In 
some 
disputes, 
the 
Company 
seeks 
to 
enforce 
its 
rights 
under 
an 
 agreement or to 
collect funds owing 
to it. 
In other matters, 
the Company is 
resisting attempts 
by others to 
collect 
 funds or 
enforce 
alleged rights. 
These disputes 
arise from 
time to 
time and 
are ultimately 
resolved through 
both 
 informal 
and 
formal 
means, 
including 
negotiated 
resolution, 
arbitration 
and 
litigation. 
In 
all 
such 
matters, 
the 
 Company believes 
that its positions 
are legally and 
commercially reasonable. 
The Company 
considers the 
statuses 
 of these proceedings when determining its reserves 
for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses. 

 Aside from litigation and arbitrations 
related to these insurance and 
reinsurance agreements, 
the Company is not a 
 party to any other material litigation 
or arbitration.

 Dividend History and Restrictions. 
 The Company did not pay any dividend 
s 
in 2022, 2021 and 2020. 
The declaration and payment of future 
dividends, 
 if 
any, 
by 
the 
Company 
will 
be 
at 
the 
discretion 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
Directors 
and 
will 
depend 
upon 
many 
factors, 
 including 
the 
Company s 
earnings, 
financial 
condition, 
business needs 
and growth 
objectives, 
capital 
and surplus 
 requirements 
of its 
operating 
subsidiaries, 
regulatory 
restrictions, 
rating 
agency considerations 
and other 
factors. 
 As an insurance holding 
company, 
the Company is dependent 
on dividends and other permitted 
payments from 
its 
 subsidiaries to pay cash dividends 
to its stockholder. 
The payment of dividends to Holdings by Everest 
Re is subject 
 to limitations 
imposed by 
Delaware law. 
Generally, 
Everest 
Re may 
only pay 
dividends out 
of its 
statutory 
earned 
 surplus, 
which 
was 
 5.6 
billion 
at 
December 
31, 
2022, 
and 
only 
after 
it 
has 
given 
10 
days 
prior 
notice 
to 
the 
 Delaware 
Insurance 
Commissioner. 
During this 
10-day 
period, the 
Commissioner may, 
by order, 
limit or 
disallow 
 the payment 
of ordinary 
dividends if 
the Commissioner 
finds the 
insurer to 
be presently 
or potentially 
in financial 
 distress. Further, 
the maximum amount 
of dividends 
that may 
be paid without 
the prior approval 
of the Delaware 
 Insurance Commissioner in any twelve 
month period is the greater of (1) 
10 of an insurer s statutory 
surplus as of 
 the end of the 
prior calendar year 
or (2) the insurer s 
statutory net 
income, not including 
realized capital 
gains, for 

14 
 the prior calendar year. 
The maximum amount 
that is available 
for the payment 
of dividends by Everest 
Re in 2023 
 without prior regulatory approval 
is 555 million.

ITEM 7. 
MANAGEMENT S 
DISCUSSION 
AND 
ANALYSIS 
OF 
FINANCIAL 
CONDITION 
AND 
RESULTS 
OF 
 OPERATION 
 The following 
is a 
discussion and 
analysis of 
our results 
of operations 
and financial 
condition. 
It should 
be read 
in 
 conjunction with the Consolidated 
Financial Statements 
and accompanying notes 
thereto presented 
under ITEM 8, 
 Financial Statements and Supplementary 
Data . 
 Industry Conditions. 
 The 
worldwide 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
businesses 
are 
highly 
competitive, 
as 
well 
as 
cyclical 
by 
product 
and 
 market. 
As 
such, 
financial 
results 
tend 
to 
fluctuate 
with 
periods 
of 
constrained 
availability, 
higher 
rates 
and 
 stronger 
profits followed 
by periods 
of abundant 
capacity, 
lower rates 
and constrained 
profitability. 
Competition 
 in 
the 
types 
of 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
business 
that 
we 
underwrite 
is 
based 
on 
many 
factors, 
including 
the 
 perceived 
overall 
financial 
strength 
of 
the 
reinsurer 
or 
insurer, 
ratings 
of 
the 
reinsurer 
or 
insurer 
by 
A.M. 
Best 
 and/or 
Standard 
 
Poor s, 
underwriting 
expertise, 
the 
jurisdictions 
where 
the 
reinsurer 
or 
insurer 
is 
licensed 
or 
 otherwise 
authorized, 
capacity 
and 
coverages 
offered, 
premiums 
charged, 
other 
terms 
and 
conditions 
of 
the 
 reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
business 
offered, 
services 
offered, 
speed 
of 
claims 
payment 
and 
reputation 
and 
 experience in lines written. 
Furthermore, the market impact 
from these competitive factors 
related to reinsurance 
 and 
insurance 
is 
generally 
not 
consistent 
across 
lines 
of business, 
domestic 
and 
international 
geographical 
areas 
 and distribution channels. 

 We 
compete 
in the 
U.S. and 
international 
reinsurance 
and insurance 
markets 
with numerous 
global competitors. 
 Our 
competitors 
include 
independent 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
companies, 
subsidiaries 
or 
affiliates 
of 
 established 
worldwide 
insurance 
companies, 
reinsurance 
departments 
of certain 
insurance 
companies, 
domestic 
 and 
international 
underwriting 
operations, 
and 
certain 
government 
sponsored 
risk 
transfer 
vehicles. 
Some 
of 
 these 
competitors 
have 
greater 
financial 
resources 
than 
we 
do 
and 
have 
established 
long-term 
and 
continuing 
 business relationships, 
which can be a 
significant competitive 
advantage. 
In addition, the lack 
of strong barriers 
to 
 entry 
into 
the 
reinsurance 
business 
and 
the 
securitization 
of 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
risks 
through 
capital 
 markets provide additional 
sources of potential reinsurance 
and insurance capacity and competition. 

 Worldwide 
insurance 
and 
reinsurance 
market 
conditions 
historically 
have 
been 
competitive. 
Generally, 
there 
is 
 ample 
insurance 
and 
reinsurance 
capacity 
relative 
to 
demand, 
as 
well 
as, 
additional 
capital 
from 
the 
capital 
 markets through 
insurance linked 
financial instruments. 
These financial instruments 
such as side cars, 
catastrophe 
 bonds and collateralized 
reinsurance funds, 
provided capital 
markets with 
access to insurance 
and reinsurance 
risk 
 exposure. 
The capital 
markets 
demand for 
these products 
is primarily 
driven by 
the desire 
to achieve 
greater 
risk 
 diversification 
and 
potentially 
higher 
returns 
on 
their 
investments. 
This 
competition 
generally 
has 
a 
negative 
 impact 
on 
rates, 
terms 
and 
conditions; 
however, 
the 
impact 
varies 
widely 
by 
market 
and 
coverage. 
Based 
on 
 recent 
competitive 
behaviors 
in 
the 
insurance 
and 
reinsurance 
industry, 
natural 
catastrophe 
events 
and 
the 
 macroeconomic 
backdrop, 
there 
has 
been 
some 
dislocation 
in 
the 
market 
which 
we 
expect 
to 
have 
a 
positive 
 impact on rates and terms and conditions 
generally, 
though local market specificities can 
vary. 
 The increased frequency of 
catastrophe 
losses experienced throughout 
2022 appears to be pressuring 
the increase 
 of 
rates. 
As 
business 
activity 
continues 
to 
regain 
strength 
after 
the 
pandemic 
and 
current 
macroeconomic 

15 
 uncertainty, 
rates 
also 
appear 
to 
be 
firming 
in 
most 
lines 
of 
business, 
particularly 
in 
the 
casualty 
lines 
that 
had 
 seen 
significant 
losses 
such 
as 
excess 
casualty 
and 
directors 
and 
officers 
liability. 
Other 
casualty 
lines 
are 
 experiencing 
modest 
rate 
increase, 
while 
some 
lines 
such 
as 
workers 
compensation 
were 
experiencing 
softer 
 market 
conditions. 
It 
is 
too 
early 
to 
tell 
what 
the 
impact 
on 
pricing 
conditions 
will 
be 
but 
it 
is 
likely 
to 
change 
 depending on the line of business and geography. 
 Our capital 
position remains 
a source 
of strength, 
with high 
quality invested 
assets, significant 
liquidity and 
a low 
 operating expense 
ratio. Our diversified 
global platform 
with its broad mix 
of products, distribution 
and geography 
 is resilient. 
 The war 
in the 
Ukraine 
is ongoing 
and an 
evolving 
event. 
Economic 
and legal 
sanctions 
have 
been levied 
against 
 Russia, specific named individuals 
and entities connected 
to the Russian government, 
as well as businesses 
located 
 in the 
Russian Federation 
and/or owned 
by Russian 
nationals by 
numerous countries, 
including the 
United States. 
 The 
significant 
political 
and 
economic 
uncertainty 
surrounding 
the 
war 
and 
associated 
sanctions 
have 
impacted 
 economic 
and 
investment 
markets 
both 
within 
Russia 
and 
around 
the 
world. 
The 
Company 
has 
recorded 
 25 
 million of losses related to the Ukraine 
/Russia war during 2022.

 Revenues. 
 Premiums. 
Gross 
written 
premiums 
increased 
by 
3.7 to 
 9.7 billion 
in 
2022, compared 
to 
 9.3 billion 
in 
2021, 
 reflecting a 426 
million, or 12.9 , 
increase in our 
insurance business 
and an 81 million, 
or 1.3 , decrease 
in our 

17 
 reinsurance 
business. 
The 
increase 
in 
insurance 
premiums 
reflects 
growth 
across 
most 
lines 
of 
business, 
 particularly 
specialty 
casualty 
business 
and 
property/short 
tail 
business, 
driven 
by 
positive 
rate 
and 
exposure 
 increases, new business 
and strong renewal 
retention. 
The decrease in reinsurance 
premiums was mainly due 
to a 
 decline in property pro 
rata business. Net 
written premiums increased 
by 4.0 to 8.0 billion in 2022, 
compared to 
 7.7 billion in 
2021 which is 
consistent 
with the change 
in gross 
written premiums. 
Premiums 
earned increased by 
 9.7 
to 
 7.9 
billion 
in 
2022, 
compared 
to 
 7.2 
billion 
in 
2021. 
The 
change 
in 
premiums 
earned 
relative 
to 
net 
 written premiums 
is the 
result of 
timing; premiums 
are earned 
ratably 
over the 
coverage 
period whereas 
written 
 premiums are recorded at the 
initiation of the coverage period. 
 Other Income 
(Expense). 
We 
recorded 
other expense 
of 6 
million and 
other income 
of 23 
million in 
2022 and 
 2021, respectively. 
The changes were primarily the result of fluctuations 
in foreign currency exchange 
rates.

Attritional losses exclude catastrophe 
losses. 
 (Some amounts may not reconcile due 
to rounding.) 
 Incurred losses and LAE 
increased by 8.1 to 5.8 
billion in 2022 compared 
to 5.4 billion in 2021, 
primarily due to 
 an 
increase 
of 
 389 
million 
in 
current 
year 
attritional 
losses 
and 
an 
increase 
of 
 44 
million 
in 
current 
year 
 catastrophe 
losses. 
The increase 
in current 
year attritional 
losses was 
mainly related 
to the 
impact of the 
increase 
 in premiums earned 
and 25 million 
of attritional losses 
incurred due to 
the Ukraine/Russia 
war. 
The current year 

18 
 catastrophe 
losses 
of 
 987 
million 
in 
2022 
related 
primarily 
to 
Hurricane 
Ian 768 
million), 
the 
2022 
Australia 
 floods 75 million), 
the 2022 South 
Africa flood 43 
million), Hurricane 
Fiona 27 million), 
and the 2022 
Canada 
 derecho 20 million), with 
the remaining losses resulting 
from various storm 
events. 
The current year 
catastrophe 
 losses 
of 
 943 
million 
in 
2021 
primarily 
related 
to 
Hurricane 
Ida 423 
million), 
the 
Texas 
winter 
storms 288 
 million), the 
European floods 108 million), 
the Canada 
drought loss 80 million) 
and the 
Quad State 
Tornadoes 
 42 million), with the rest of the losses emanating 
from the 2021 Australia floods. 
 Commission, Brokerage, 
Taxes 
and Fees. 
Commission, brokerage, 
taxes 
and fees 
increased to 
 1.6 billion 
in 2022 
 compared to 1.5 billion 
in 2021. The increase was mainly 
due to increases in premiums 
earned and changes in the 
 mix of business. 
 Other Underwriting Expenses. 
Other underwriting expenses 
were 501 million and 
 454 million in 2022 
and 2021, 
 respectively. 
The 
increase 
in 
other 
underwriting 
expenses 
was 
mainly 
due 
to 
the 
continued 
build 
out 
of 
our 
 insurance operations, including an 
expansion of the international insurance 
platform. 

 Corporate 
Expenses. 
Corporate 
expenses, 
which 
are 
general 
operating 
expenses 
that 
are 
not 
allocated 
to 
 segments, 
were 
 26 million 
and 
 33 million 
for 
the years 
ended December 
31, 
2022 and 
2021, respectively. 
The 
 decrease from 2021 to 2022 was mainly due 
to a decrease in variable incentive compensation. 
 Interest, 
Fees 
and 
Bond 
Issue 
Cost 
Amortization 
Expense. 
Interest, 
fees 
and 
other 
bond 
amortization 
expense 
 were 101 
million and 
 70 million 
in 2022 
and 2021, 
respectively. 
The increase 
in interest 
expense was 
primarily 
 due 
to 
the 
issuance 
of 
 1.0 
billion 
of 
senior 
notes 
in 
October 
2021. 
Interest 
expense 
was 
also 
impacted 
by 
the 
 movements 
in the 
floating interest 
rate 
related 
to the 
long-term subordinated 
notes, which 
is reset 
quarterly per 
 the note agreement. 
The floating rate 
was 6.99 as 
of December 31, 2022 
compared to 2.54 
as of December 31, 
 2021. 
 Income Tax 
Expense (Benefit). 
The Company had 
an income tax 
benefit of 112 
million and income 
tax expense 
of 
 192 
million 
in 
2022 
and 
2021, 
respectively. 
Variations 
in 
income 
taxes 
generally 
result 
from 
changes 
in 
the 
 relative levels 
of pre-tax 
income, including 
the impact 
of catastrophe 
losses and 
net gains 
(losses) on 
investments 
 as 
well 
as 
changes 
in 
tax 
exempt 
investment 
income 
and 
creditable 
foreign 
taxes. 
The 
change 
from 
income 
tax 
 expense to income 
tax benefit 
resulted primarily from 
increased fair 
value and capital 
losses as well as 
an increase 
 in catastrophe losses. 

 The Coronavirus 
Aid, Relief, 
and Economic 
Security CARES 
Act, enacted 
on March 
27, 2020, 
provided that 
U.S. 
 companies could 
carryback for 
five years 
net operating 
losses incurred 
in 2018, 
2019 and/or 
2020. This 
beneficial 
 tax provision 
in the CARES 
Act enabled the 
Company to 
carryback its 
significant 2018 
net operating 
losses to 
prior 
 tax years 
with higher effective 
tax rates 
of 35 versus 
21 in 2018 
and later 
years. 
As a result, 
the Company 
was 
 able to 
record a 
net income 
tax benefit 
from the 
five-year 
carryback of 
 33 million 
and obtain 
federal income 
tax 
 cash refunds of 183 million including interest 
in 2020. 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction 
Act of 2022 IRA was enacted. We 
have evaluated 
the tax provisions 
 of 
the 
IRA, 
the 
most 
significant 
of 
which 
are 
the 
corporate 
alternative 
minimum 
tax 
and 
the 
share 
repurchase 
 excise tax and do not expect 
the legislation to have a material 
impact on our results of operations. As the 
IRS issues 
 additional guidance, we will evaluate any 
impact to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Net Income (Loss). 

 Our net 
loss 
was 
 445 million 
and 
net income 
was 
 800 
million in 
2022 
and 20 
21, respectively 
. 
The change 
was 
 primarily driven by the consolidated investment 
results explained below. 

 Ratios. 
 Our 
combined 
ratio 
decreased 
by 
1.4 
points 
to 
101.0 
in 
2022 
compared 
to 
102.4 
in 
2021. 
The 
loss 
ratio 
 component decreased by 1.1 points 
in 2022 over the same period last year. 
The decline in the ratio was mainly due 
 to lower loss experience. 
Although both current 
year attritional and 
current year catastrophe 
losses were higher in 

19 
 2022 
than 
2021, 
the 
rate 
of 
increase 
in 
the 
current 
year 
losses 
was 
lower 
than 
the 
rate 
of 
increase 
in 
earned 
 premiums 
resulting 
in 
a 
reduction 
of 
the 
overall 
loss 
ratio. 
The 
commission 
and 
brokerage 
ratio 
component 
 decreased 
to 
20.7 in 
2022 
compared 
to 
21.1 in 
2021, 
reflecting 
changes 
in 
affiliated 
reinsurance 
agreements 
 and changes 
in the 
mix of 
business. The 
other underwriting 
expense ratio 
slightly increased 
to 6.4 
in 2022 
from 
 6.3 in 2021. The increase was mainly due to higher insurance 
operations costs. 

 Stockholder's Equity. 

 Stockholder s 
equity decreased 
by 1.4 
billion to 
 5.7 billion at 
December 31, 2022 
from 7.0 
billion at 
December 
 31, 
2021, 
principally 
as 
a 
result 
of 
 445 
million 
of 
net 
loss, 
 938 
million 
of 
net 
unrealized 
depreciation 
on 
 investments, 
net 
of 
tax 
and 
 18 
million 
of 
net 
foreign 
currency 
translation 
adjustments, 
partially 
offset 
by 
 17 
 million of net benefit plan obligation adjustments 
. 

 Consolidated Investment 
Results 

 Net Investment Income. 

 Net 
investment 
income 
decreased 
by 
14.3 
to 
 638 
million 
in 
2022 
compared 
to 
 745 
million 
in 
2021. 
The 
 decrease was 
primarily the 
result of 
a decline 
of 249 
million in 
limited partnership 
income, partially 
offset by 
an 
 additional 
 166 
million 
of 
income 
from 
fixed 
maturity 
investments. 
The 
limited 
partnership 
income 
primarily 
 reflects 
decreases 
in 
their 
reported 
net 
asset 
values. 
As 
such, 
until 
these 
asset 
values 
are 
monetized 
and 
the 
 resultant income is 
distributed, they 
are subject to future 
increases or decreases 
in the asset value, 
and the results 
 may be volatile.

 Segment Results. 
 The Company 
manages its 
reinsurance 
and insurance 
operations 
as autonomous 
units and 
key 
strategic 
decisions 
 are based on the aggregate operating 
results and projections for these segments 
of business. 

 The 
Reinsurance 
operation 
writes 
risks 
on 
a 
worldwide 
basis 
in 
property 
and 
casualty 
reinsurance 
and 
specialty 
 lines of business, on both a treaty and facultative 
basis, through reinsurance brokers, 
as well as directly with ceding 
 companies. 
Business 
is 
written 
in 
the 
United 
States 
as 
well as 
through 
branches 
in 
Canada 
and 
Singapore. 
The 
 Insurance operation 
writes property and 
casualty insurance directly 
and through brokers, 
surplus lines brokers 
and 
 general agents within the United States. 

 These segments 
are 
managed 
independently, 
but conform 
with corporate 
guidelines 
with respect 
to 
pricing, risk 
 management, 
control 
of 
aggregate 
catastrophe 
exposures, 
capital, 
investments 
and 
support 
operations. 

 Management generally monitors 
and evaluates the financial performance 
of these operating segments 
based upon 
 their underwriting results. 

 Underwriting 
results 
include 
earned 
premium 
less 
losses 
and 
LAE 
incurred, 
commission 
and 
brokerage 
expenses 
 and other underwriting expenses. 
We measure our underwriting results 
using ratios, in particular loss, commission 
 and brokerage 
and other underwriting 
expense ratios, 
which respectively, 
divide incurred 
losses, commissions 
and 
 brokerage and other 
underwriting expenses by premiums earned. 

 The 
Company 
does 
not 
maintain 
separate 
balance 
sheet 
data 
for 
its 
operating 
segments. 
Accordingly, 
the 
 Company 
does not 
review and 
evaluate 
the financial 
results 
of its 
operating 
segments based 
upon balance 
sheet 
 data. 

 Our 
loss 
and 
LAE 
reserves 
are 
management s 
best 
estimate 
of 
our 
ultimate 
liability 
for 
unpaid 
claims. 
We 
re-
 evaluate 
our 
estimates 
on 
an 
ongoing 
basis, 
including 
all 
prior 
period 
reserves, 
taking 
into 
consideration 
all 
 available 
information 
and, 
in 
particular, 
recently 
reported 
loss 
claim 
experience 
and 
trends 
related 
to 
prior 
 periods. 
Such 
re-evaluations 
are 
recorded 
in 
incurred 
losses 
in 
the 
period 
in 
which 
the 
re-evaluation 
is 
made. 
 Management s 
best 
estimate 
is 
developed 
through 
collaboration 
with 
actuarial, 
underwriting, 
claims, 
legal 
and 
 finance 
departments 
and 
culminates 
with 
the 
input 
of 
reserve 
committees. 
Each 
segment 
reserve 
committee 
 includes the 
participation of 
the relevant 
parties from 
actuarial, finance, 
claims and 
segment senior 
management 
 and 
has 
the 
responsibility 
for 
recommending 
and 
approving 
management s 
best 
estimate. 
Reserves 
are 
further 
 reviewed 
by 
Everest s 
Chief 
Reserving 
Actuary 
and 
senior 
management. 
The 
objective 
of 
such 
process 
is 
to 
 determine a single best estimate 
viewed by management to be the best 
estimate of its ultimate loss liability. 

 The following discusses the underwriting results for 
each of our segments for the periods indicated:

 Premiums. 
Gross written 
premiums decreased 
by 1.3 
to 5.9 
billion in 
2022 from 
 6.0 billion 
in 2021, 
primarily 
 due 
to 
a 
decline 
in 
property 
pro 
rata 
business. 
Net 
written 
premiums 
remained 
flat 
at 
 5.3 
billion 
in 
2022 
and 
 2021. The 
difference 
in the 
percentage 
change in 
gross written 
premiums compared 
to the 
percentage 
change in 
 net 
written 
premiums 
was 
primarily 
due 
to 
the 
reduction 
in 
business 
ceded 
to 
the 
segregated 
accounts 
of 
Mt. 
 Logan 
Re 
during 
2022 
compared 
to 
2021. 
Premiums 
earned 
increased 
5.3 
to 
 5.2 
billion 
in 
2022 
compared 
to 
 4.9 
billion 
in 
2021. 
The 
change 
in 
premiums 
earned 
relative 
to 
net 
written 
premiums 
is 
the 
result 
of 
timing; 
 premiums are earned 
ratably over 
the coverage period 
whereas written premiums 
are recorded 
at the initiation of 
 the coverage period.

 Incurred 
losses 
increased 
by 
5.2 
to 
 4.0 
billion 
in 
2022 
compared 
to 
 3.8 
billion 
in 
2021. 
The 
increase 
was 
 primarily 
due 
to 
an 
increase 
of 
 111 
million 
in 
current 
year 
attritional 
losses 
and 
an 
increase 
of 
 78 
million 
in 
 current year 
catastrophe 
losses. The 
increase in 
current year 
attritional losses 
was primarily 
related to 
the impact 
 of the 
increase 
in premiums 
earned and 
 25 million 
of attritional 
losses 
incurred due 
to the 
Ukraine/Russia 
war. 

 The current 
year catastrophe 
losses of 
 870 million 
in 2022 
related 
primarily to 
Hurricane 
Ian 669 
million), the 
 2022 Australia floods 75 million), the 2022 
South Africa flood 43 million), Hurricane Fiona 24 million), and the 
 2022 
Canada 
derecho 20 
million), 
with 
the 
remaining 
losses 
resulting 
from 
various 
storm 
events. 
The 
current 
 year catastr 
ophe losses 
of 792 
million in 
2021 primarily 
related to 
Hurricane Ida 345 million), 
the Texas 
winter 
 storms 231 
million), 
the 
European 
floods 108 
million), 
the 
Canada 
drought 
loss 80 
million) 
and 
the 
Quad 
 State Tornadoes 27 million), with the rest of the losses emanating 
from the 2021 Australia floods.

2022 
compared 
to 
 1.25

in 
 2021. The increase 
was due 
to the impact 
of the increase 
in premiums earned 
and changes in 
the mix of 
business.

premiums 
increased 
by 12.9 
to 
 3.7 billion 
in 2022 
compared 
to 3.3 
billion in 
2021. 
 The 
increase 
in 
insurance 
premiums 
reflects 
growth 
across 
most 
lines 
of business, 
particularly 
specialty 
casualty 
 business and property/short 
tail business, driven 
by positive rate 
and exposure increases, 
new business and strong 
 renewal 
retention. 
Net written 
premiums 
increased 
by 
12.5 to 
 2.8 billion 
in 2022 
compared 
to 
 2.5 billion 
in 
 2021 
which 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
change 
in 
gross 
written 
premiums. 
Premiums 
earned 
increased 
19.5 
to 
 2.7 
 billion in 2022 
compared to 
 2.2 billion in 
2021. The change 
in premiums 
earned is the 
result of timing;

 Incurred losses 
and LAE increased 
by 14.7 to 
 1.9 billion in 
2022 compared 
to 1.6 billion 
in 2021, mainly 
due to 
 an increase of 
 277 million of 
current year 
attritional losses, 
partially offset by 
a decrease of 34 
million in current 
 year catastrophe losses 
. 
The rise in current year attritional losses 
was primarily due to the impact of the increase in 
 premiums 
earned. The 
current 
year 
catastrophe 
losses of 
 117 million 
in 2022 
related 
primarily to 
Hurricane Ian 
 99 
million), 
with 
the 
remaining 
losses 
resulting 
from 
various 
storm 
events. 
The 
 151 
million 
of 
current 
year 
 catastrophe 
losses in 
2021, primarily 
related 
to Hurricane 
Ida 78 
million), the 
Texas 
winter storms 58 million) 
 and the Quad State Tornadoes 15 million).

other underwriting 
expenses increased 
to 363 
million in 
2022 compared 
to 311

 The 
increases 
were 
mainly 
due 
to 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
increases 
in 
premiums 
earned 
and 
expenses 
related 
to 
the 
 continued build out of the insurance business.

 ITEM 7A. 
QUANTITATIVE 
AND QUALITATIVE 
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market Sensitive Instruments. 
 The 
SEC s 
Financial 
Reporting 
Release 
#48 
requires 
registrants 
to 
clarify 
and 
expand 
upon 
the 
existing 
financial 
 statement 
disclosure 
requirements 
for 
derivative 
financial 
instruments, 
derivative 
commodity 
instruments 
and 
 other financial 
instruments 
(collectively, 
 market 
sensitive 
instruments ). 
We 
do not 
generally 
enter into 
market 
 sensitive instruments for trading 
purposes. 

 Our 
current 
investment 
strategy 
seeks 
to 
maximize 
after-tax 
income 
through 
a 
high 
quality, 
diversified, 
fixed 
 maturity 
portfolio, 
while 
maintaining 
an 
adequate 
level 
of 
liquidity. 
Our 
mix 
of 
taxable 
and 
tax-preferenced 
 investments 
is 
adjusted 
periodically, 
consistent 
with 
our 
current 
and 
projected 
operating 
results, 
market 
 conditions 
and 
our 
tax 
position. 
The 
fixed 
maturity 
securities 
in 
the 
investment 
portfolio 
are 
comprised 
of 
non-
 trading securities. Additionally, 
we have invested 
in equity securities. 

 The overall investment 
strategy considers 
the scope of present 
and anticipated Company 
operations. 
In particular, 
 estimates of 
the financial 
impact resulting 
from non-investment 
asset and 
liability transactions, 
together with 
our 
 capital 
structure 
and 
other 
factors, 
are 
used 
to 
develop 
a 
net 
liability 
analysis. 
This 
analysis 
includes 
estimated 
 payout characteristics 
for which 
our investments 
provide liquidity. 
This analysis 
is considered 
in the 
development 
 of 
specific 
investment 
strategies 
for 
asset 
allocation, 
duration 
and 
credit 
quality. 
The 
change 
in 
overall 
market 
 sensitive risk exposure principally reflects 
the asset changes that took place during the period. 

 Interest 
Rate Risk. 
Our 19.2 
billion investment 
portfolio, 
at December 31, 
2022, is 
principally comprised 
of fixed 
 maturity securities, 
which are 
generally subject 
to interest 
rate risk 
and some 
foreign currency 
exchange 
rate risk, 
 and some equity securities, which are subject to price fluctuations 
and some foreign exchange 
rate risk. The overall 
 economic impact 
of the foreign 
exchange risks 
on the investment 
portfolio is 
partially mitigated 
by changes 
in the 
 dollar value of foreign currency 
denominated liabilities and their associated 
income statement impact. 

 Interest 
rate 
risk 
is 
the 
potential 
change 
in 
value 
of 
the 
fixed 
maturity 
securities 
portfolio, 
including 
short-term 
 investments, 
from 
a 
change 
in 
market 
interest 
rates. 
In 
a 
declining 
interest 
rate 
environment, 
it 
includes 
 prepayment 
risk 
on 
the 
 2.1 
billion 
of 
mortgage-backed 
securities 
in 
the 
 13.5 
billion 
fixed 
maturity 
portfolio. 
 Prepayment 
risk results 
from potential 
accelerated 
principal 
payments 
that shorten 
the average 
life and 
thus the 
 expected yield of the security. 

27 
 The 
table 
below 
displays 
the 
potential 
impact 
of 
fair 
value 
fluctuations 
and 
after-tax 
unrealized 
appreciation 
on 
 our fixed 
maturity 
portfolio 
(including 
 812 million 
of short 
-term investments) 
for 
the period 
indicated 
based 
on 
 upward 
and 
downward 
parallel 
and 
immediate 
100 
and 
200 basis 
point 
shifts 
in 
interest 
rates. 
For 
legal 
entities 
 with 
a 
U.S. 
dollar 
functional 
currency, 
this 
modeling 
was 
performed 
on 
each 
security 
individually. 
To 
generate 
 appropriate 
price 
estimate 
on 
mortgage-backed 
securities, 
changes 
in 
prepayment 
expectations 
under 
different 
 interest rate 
environments were 
taken into 
account. For 
legal entities with 
non-U.S. dollar functional 
currency, 
the 
 effective 
duration 
of the 
involved 
portfolio 
of securities 
was 
used as 
a proxy 
for 
the fair 
value 
change 
under the 
 various interest rate 
change scenarios.

 We had 15.0 
billion and 13.1 billion 
of gross reserves 
for losses and 
LAE as of December 31, 
2022 and December 
 31, 
2021, 
respectively. 
These 
amounts 
are 
recorded 
at 
their 
nominal 
value, 
as 
opposed 
to 
present 
value, 
which 
 would reflect 
a discount 
adjustment to 
reflect the time 
value of 
money. 
Since losses are 
paid out over 
a period of 
 time, the 
present value 
of the 
reserves is 
less than 
the nominal 
value. 
As interest 
rates 
rise, the 
present value 
of 
 the reserves 
decreases and, 
conversely, 
as interest 
rates 
decline, the 
present 
value increases. 
These movements 
 are 
the 
opposite 
of 
the 
interest 
rate 
impacts 
on 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
investments. 
While 
the 
difference 
between 
 present 
value 
and 
nominal 
value 
is 
not 
reflected 
in 
our 
financial 
statements, 
our 
financial 
results 
will 
include 
 investment 
income 
over 
time 
from 
the 
investment 
portfolio 
until 
the 
claims 
are 
paid. 
Our 
loss 
and loss 
reserve 
 obligations have an expected 
duration that is reasonably consistent 
with our fixed income portfolio. 

 Equity Risk. 
Equity risk is 
the potential change 
in fair value 
of the common 
stock, preferred 
stock and 
mutual fund 
 portfolios 
arising 
from 
changing 
prices. 
Our 
equity 
investments 
consist 
of 
a 
diversified 
portfolio 
of 
individual 
 securities. The primary 
objective of 
the equity portfolio 
is to 
obtain greater 
total return 
relative to 
our core 
bonds 
 over time through market appreciation 
and income. 

 The table below displays the impact on fair 
value and after-tax change 
in fair value of a 10 and 20 change in 
 equity prices up and down for the periods indicated

 Foreign 
Currency 
Risk. 
Foreign 
currency 
risk is 
the potential 
change 
in value, 
income 
and 
cash 
flow arising 
from 
 adverse changes 
in foreign 
currency exchange 
rates. 
Each of 
our non-U.S. foreign 
operations 
maintains capital 
 in the 
currency 
of the 
country 
of its 
geographic 
location 
consistent 
with local 
regulatory 
guidelines. Each 
foreign 
 operation 
may 
conduct 
business 
in 
its 
local 
currency, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
currency 
of 
other 
countries 
in 
which 
it 
 operates. 
The 
primary 
foreign 
currency 
exposures 
for 
these 
foreign 
operations 
are 
the 
Singapore 
and 
Canadian 
 Dollars. We 
mitigate foreign 
exchange 
exposure by 
generally matching 
the currency 
and duration 
of our 
assets to 
 our corresponding 
operating liabilities. In 
accordance with FASB 
guidance, the impact 
on the fair 
value of available 
 for 
sale 
fixed 
maturities 
due 
to 
changes 
in 
foreign 
currency 
exchange 
rates, 
in 
relation 
to 
functional 
currency, 
is 
 reflected as 
part of other 
comprehensive income. 
Conversely, 
the impact of 
changes in 
foreign currency 
exchange 
 rates, 
in 
relation 
to 
functional 
currency, 
on 
other 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
is 
reflected 
through 
net 
income 
as 
a 
 component of other income (expense). In 
addition, we translate 
the assets, liabilities and income of non-U.S. 
dollar 
 functional 
currency 
legal 
entities 
to 
the U.S. 
dollar. 
This translation 
amount is 
reported 
as a 
component 
of other 
 comprehensive income. 

 The tables 
below display 
the potential 
impact of 
a parallel 
and immediate 
10 and 
20 increase 
and decrease 
in 
 foreign 
exchange 
rates 
on 
the 
valuation 
of 
invested 
assets 
subject 
to 
foreign 
currency 
exposure 
for 
the 
periods 
 indicated. 
This 
analysis 
includes 
the 
after-tax 
impact 
of 
translation 
from 
transactional 
currency 
to 
functional 
 currency 
as 
well 
as 
the 
after-tax 
impact 
of 
translation 
from 
functional 
currency 
to 
the 
U.S. 
dollar 
reporting 
 currency.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 As 
required 
by 
Rule 
13a-15(b) 
of 
the 
Securities 
Exchange 
Act 
of 
1934 
(the 
Exchange 
Act), 
our 
management, 
 including our 
Chief Executive 
Officer and 
Chief Financial 
Officer, 
has evaluated 
the effectiveness 
of our 
disclosure 
 controls 
and 
procedures 
(as 
defined 
in 
Rule 
13a-15(e) 
under 
the 
Exchange 
Act). 
Based 
on 
that 
evaluation, 
the 
 Chief 
Executive 
Officer 
and 
Chief 
Financial 
Officer 
have 
concluded 
that 
our 
disclosure 
controls 
and 
procedures 
 were effective as of the 
end of the period covered by this annual rep 
ort. 
 Management s Annual Report 
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Our 
management 
is 
responsible 
for 
establishing 
and 
maintaining 
adequate 
internal 
controls 
over 
financial 
 reporting. 
Our internal 
control over 
financial reporting 
is designed 
to provide 
reasonable assurance 
regarding the 
 reliability 
of 
financial 
reporting 
and 
the 
preparation 
of 
our 
financial 
statements 
for 
external 
purposes 
in 
 accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. 

 Because 
of 
its 
inherent 
limitations, 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
may 
not 
prevent 
or 
detect 
 misstatements. 
Also, 
projections 
of any 
evaluation 
of effectiveness 
to 
future 
periods are 
subject 
to 
the risk 
that 
 controls 
may 
become 
inadequate 
because 
of 
changes 
in 
conditions, 
or 
that 
the 
degree 
of 
compliance 
with 
the 
 policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

 Management 
has 
assessed 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
our 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
 2022. In 
making this 
assessment, we 
used the 
criteria set 
forth 
by the 
Committee 
of Sponsoring 
Organizations 
of 
 the Treadway 
Commission (COSO) in 
 Internal Control 
Integrated Framework
 
(2013). 
Based on our assessment 
we 
 concluded that, 
as of 
December 31, 
2022, our 
internal control 
over financial 
reporting is 
effective 
based on 
those 
 criteria. 
 Attestation Report 
of the Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 This 
annual 
report 
does 
not

report 
of 
the 
Company s 
registered 
public 
accounting 
firm 
 regarding 
internal 
control 
over financial 
reporting. 
Management s 
internal 
controls 
are 
not subject

Commission 
 that permit 
the Company 
to provide 
only management s 
report in 
this annual report 
due to 
the Company s 
status 
 as a non-accelerated filer. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over 
Financial Reporting 
 As 
required 
by 
Rule 
13a-15(d) 
of 
the 
Exchange 
Act, 
our 
management, 
including 
our 
Chief 
Executive 
Officer 
and 
 Chief 
Financial 
Officer, 
has 
evaluated 
our 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
to 
determine 
whether 
any 
 changes 
occurred 
during 
the fourth 
fiscal quarter 
covered 
by 
this annual 
report 
that have 
materially 
affected, 
or 
 are 
reasonably 
likely 
to materially 
affect, 
our internal 
control 
over 
financial reporting. 
Based on 
that evaluation, 
 there has been no such change during the fourth 
quarter.

31 
 Under its 
Charter and 
the Audit 
and Non-Audit 
Services Pre-Approval 
Policy (the 
 Policy ), the 
Audit Committee 
 is 
required 
to 
pre-approve 
the 
audit 
and 
non-audit 
services 
to 
be 
performed 
by 
the 
independent 
auditors. 
The 
 Policy 
mandates 
specific 
approval 
by 
the 
Audit 
Committee 
for 
any 
service 
that 
has 
not 
received 
a 
general 
pre-
 approval 
or 
that 
exceeds 
pre-approved 
cost 
levels 
or 
budgeted 
amounts. 
For 
both 
specific 
and 
general 
pre-
 approval, 
the 
Audit 
Committee 
considers 
whether 
such 
services 
are 
consistent 
with 
the 
SEC s 
rules 
on 
auditor 
 independence. 
The 
Audit 
Committee 
also 
considers 
whether 
the 
independent 
auditors 
are 
best 
positioned 
to 
 provide 
the most 
effective 
and efficient 
service and 
whether the 
service might 
enhance the 
Company s 
ability to 
 manage or control 
risk or improve 
audit quality. 
The Audit Committee 
is also mindful 
of the relationship 
between 
 fees for 
audit and 
non-audit services in 
deciding whether 
to pre-approve 
any such 
services. 
It may 
determine, for 
 each fiscal 
year, 
the appropriate 
ratio 
between 
the total 
amount 
of 
audit, audit 
-related 
and tax 
fees 
and a 
total 
 amount of fees 
for certain 
permissible non-audit 
services classified below 
as All 
Other Fees . 
All such factors 
are 
 considered as 
a whole, 
and no 
one factor 
is determinative. 
The Audit 
Committee 
further considered 
whether the 
 performance by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP of the 
non-audit related 
services disclosed 
below is compatible 
with 
 maintaining 
their 
independence. 
The 
Audit 
Committee 
approved 
all 
of 
the 
audit-related 
fees, 
tax 
fees 
and 
all 
 other fees for 2022 and 2021.

 Report of Independent Registered 
Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Board 
of Directors and Stockholder of Everest 
Reinsurance Holdings, Inc. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the 
accompanying consolidated 
balance sheets of Everest Reinsurance 
Holdings, Inc. and its 
 subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related 
consolidated statements 
of 
 operations and comprehensive income 
(loss), of changes in stockholder's equity and 
of cash flows for each of the 
 three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including 
the related notes and financial statement 
schedules 
 listed in the accompanying index 
appearing on page F-1 (collectively referred 
to as the consolidated 
financial 
 statements ). In our opinion, the 
consolidated financial statements 
present fairly, 
in all material respects, the 
 financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 
2021, and the results of its operations and its 
cash 
 flows for each of the three years 
in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting 
principles 
 generally accepted in the United 
States of America. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements 
are the responsibility of the Company s 
management. Our responsibility is 
 to express an opinion on the Company s 
consolidated financial statements 
based on our audits. We are a 
public 
 accounting firm registered with 
the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States) (PCAOB) and 
are 
 required to be independent with respect 
to the Company in accordance with the U.S. 
federal securities laws and 
 the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits 
of these consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with the standards 
of the 
 PCAOB. Those standards 
require that we plan and perform the 
audits to obtain reasonable assurance 
about 
 whether the consolidated financial statements 
are free of material misstatement, 
whether due to error or fraud. 
 The Company is not required to have, 
nor were we engaged to perform, 
an audit of its internal control over 
 financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required 
to obtain an understanding 
of internal control over 
 financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's 
internal 
 control over financial reporting. Accordingly 
, 
we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures 
to assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the consolidated 
 financial statements, whether 
due to error or fraud, and performing 
procedures that respond 
to those risks. Such 
 procedures included examining, on 
a test basis, evidence regarding 
the amounts and disclosures in the 
 consolidated financial statements. 
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting 
principles used and 
 significant estimates made by management, 
as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the consolidated 
 financial statements. We 
believe that our audits provide a reasonable 
basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matter communicated 
below is a matter arising from the current 
period audit of the consolidated 
 financial statements that was 
communicated or required to 
be communicated to the audit committee 
and that (i) 
 relates to accounts or disclosures 
that are material to the consolidated 
financial statements and (ii) involved 
our 
 especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. 
The communication of critical audit matters 
does not 
 alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements, taken 
as a whole, and we are not, by 
 communicating the critical audit matter 
below, providing 
a separate opinion on the critical audit 
matter or on the 
 accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Valuation of the Reserve for Losses and 
Loss Adjustment Expenses
 As described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated 
financial statements, the Company 
maintains reserves equal to 
 the estimated ultimate liability 
for losses and loss adjustment expense for 
reported and unreported claims for 
both 

F-3 
 insurance and reinsurance 
businesses. The Company s reserve 
for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
as of 
 December 31, 2022 was 15.0 billion. Reserves are 
based on estimates of ultimate losses 
and loss adjustment 
 expenses by underwriting or accident year. 
Management uses a variety of statistical 
and actuarial techniques to 
 monitor reserve adequacy over time, evaluate 
new information as it becomes known 
and adjust reserves as 
 warranted. Management considers 
many factors when setting 
reserves including (i) exposure base and 
projected 
 ultimate premium; (ii) expected 
loss ratios by product and class 
of business, which are developed collaboratively 
 by underwriters and actuaries; (iii) actuarial methodologies 
and assumptions which analyze loss reporting 
and 
 payment experience, reports from 
ceding companies and historical trends, 
such as reserving patterns, loss 
 payments and product mix; (iv) current 
legal interpretations 
of coverage and liability; and (v) economic conditions. 

 The principal considerations for 
our determination that performing procedures 
relating to the valuation of the 
 reserve for losses and loss adjustment 
expenses is a critical audit matter are 
the significant judgment by 
 management when developing their estimate; 
this in turn led to a high degree of auditor subjectivity, 
judgment 
 and effort in performing procedures 
and evaluating the audit evidence relating 
to the methodologies and the 
 significant assumptions related 
to expected loss ratios 
and historical trends, such as reserving patterns, 
loss 
 payments and product mix, and the audit 
effort involved the use of professionals 
with specialized skill and 
 knowledge. 

 Addressing the matter involved 
performing procedures and evaluating 
audit evidence in connection with forming 
 our overall opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements. These procedures 
included testing the effectiveness 
 of controls relating to management s 
valuation of the reserve for losses and 
loss adjustment expenses, including 
 controls over the selection of methodologies 
and development of significant assumptions. 
These procedures also 
 included, among others, testing the completeness 
and accuracy of data provided 
by management and the 
 involvement of professionals 
with specialized skill and knowledge to assist 
in performing procedures for a sample 
 of products and lines of business including: (i) evaluating 
management s methodologies and 
assumptions related 
 to expected loss ratios 
and historical trends, such as, reserving patterns, 
loss payment and product mix used for 
 determining reserves for losses and 
loss adjustment expenses; and (ii) developing an 
independent estimate of the 
 reserve for losses and loss adjustment 
expenses and comparing the independent estimate 
to management s 
 actuarially determined reserves.

The fair

securities 
for 
the issuer 
with the

The 

million 
of 
 unrealized losses related

The

losses 
related 
to 
fixed 
maturity 
securities 
 available 
for sale 
in an 
unrealized

for more 
than one

primarily to 
domestic and 
foreign 
 corporate 
securities 
as 
well 
as 
agency 
residential 
mortgage 
backed 
securities. 
Of 
these 
unrealized

million 
were

 investments 
and the 
related interest 
obligations. 
The mortgage-backed 
securities still 
have excess 
credit coverage 
 and are 
current on 
interest and 
principal payments. 
Based upon 
the Company s 
current evaluation 
of securities 
in 
 an unrealized 
loss position as of 
December 31, 2022, the 
unrealized losses 
are due to 
changes in interest 
rates and 
 non-issuer specific 
credit spreads 
and are 
not credit 
related. In 
addition, the 
contractual 
terms of 
these securities 
 do not permit these securities to be settled at a price less 
than their amortized cost. 

 The Company, 
given the size 
of its investment 
portfolio and capital 
position, does not 
have the 
intent to 
sell these 
 securities; and 
it is 
more likely 
than not 
that the 
Company will 
not have 
to sell 
the security 
before 
recovery 
of its 
 cost 
basis. 
In 
addition, 
all 
securities 
currently 
in 
an 
unrealized 
loss 
position 
are 
current 
with 
respect 
to 
principal 
 and interest payments

 Variable Interest 
Entities 
 The 
Company 
is 
engaged 
with 
various 
special 
purpose 
entities 
and 
other 
entities 
that 
are 
deemed 
to 
be 
VIEs 
 primarily as an investor 
through normal investment 
activities but also as 
an investment manager. 
A VIE is an 
entity 
 that either has 
investors 
that lack certain 
essential characteristics 
of a controlling 
financial interest, 
such as simple 
 majority kick-out 
rights, or lacks 
sufficient funds 
to finance its 
own activities without 
financial support provided 
by 
 other 
entities. 
The 
Company 
performs 
ongoing 
qualitative 
assessments 
of 
its 
VIEs 
to 
determine 
whether 
the 
 Company 
has 
a 
controlling 
financial 
interest 
in the 
VIE and 
therefore 
is 
the 
primary 
beneficiary. 
The Company 
is 
 deemed 
to 
have 
a 
controlling 
financial 
interest 
when 
it 
has 
both 
the 
ability 
to 
direct 
the 
activities 
that 
most 
 significantly 
impact 
the 
economic 
performance 
of the 
VIE 
and 
the 
obligation 
to 
absorb 
losses 
or 
right 
to 
receive 
 benefits 
from 
the 
VIE 
that 
could 
potentially 
be 
significant 
to 
the 
VIE. 
Based 
on 
the 
Company s 
assessment, 
if 
it 
 determines 
it 
is 
the 
primary 
beneficiary, 
the 
Company 
consolidates 
the 
VIE 
in 
the 
Company s 
Consolidated 
 Financial Statements. 
As of 
December 31, 2022 
and 2021, 
the Company 
did not 
hold any 
securities for 
which it 
is 
 the primary beneficiary. 
 The 
Company, 
through 
normal 
investment 
activities, 
makes 
passive 
investments 
in 
general 
and 
limited 
 partnerships 
and other 
alternative investments. 
For these 
non-consolidated 
VIEs, the 
Company has 
determined it 
 is 
not 
the 
primary 
beneficiary 
as 
it 
has 
no 
ability 
to 
direct 
activities 
that 
could 
significantly 
affect 
the 
economic 
 performance of 
the investments. 
The Company s 
maximum exposure 
to loss 
as of December 31, 
2022 and 
2021 is 
 limited to 
the total 
carrying 
value of 

billion and 

billion, 
respectively, 
which are 
included in 
general 
and 
 limited 
partnerships 
and 
other 
alternative 
investments

Other 
Invested 
Assets 
in 
the 
Company's 
Consolidated 
 Balance 
Sheets. 
As 
of 
December 31, 
2022, 
the 
Company 
has 
outstanding 
commitments 
totaling 

million 
 whereby 
the Company 
is committed 
to 
fund these 
investments 
and may 
be called 
by the 
partnership 
during 
the 
 commitment 
period to 
fund the 
purchase 
of new 
investments 
and partnership 
expenses. 
These investments 
are 
 generally of a passive nature 
in that the Company does not take 
an active role in management. 
 In addition, the Company 
makes passive investments 
in structured securities issued 
by VIEs for which the Company 
 is not 
the manager. 
These investments 
are 
included in 
asset-backed 
securities, 
which includes 
collateralized 
loan 
 obligations 
and 
are 
classified 
as 
fixed 
maturities. 
The 
Company 
has 
not provided 
financial 
or 
other 
support 
with 
 respect to these investments 
other than its original investment.

billion,

billion for the years 
ended December 31, 2022, 
 2021 
and 
2020, 
respectively. 
The 
increase 
in 
current 
year 
incurred 
losses 
in 
2022 
compared 
to 
2021 
primarily 
 related to 
an increase 
of 

million in 
current year 
catastrophe 
losses and 
an increase 
of 

million in 
current 
 year 
attritional 
losses. 
The increase 
in 
current 
year 
attritional 
losses 
was 
mainly 
due 
to 
the 
growth 
in 
premiums 
 earned 
and 

million 
of losses 
due 
to 
the 
Russia/Ukraine 
conflict. 
The increase 
in 
current 
year 
incurred 
losses 
 from 
2020 
to 
2021 
was 
primarily 
due 
to 
an 
increase 
of 

million 
in 
current 
year 
catastrophe 
losses 
and 
an 
 increase 
of 

million 
in 
current 
year 
attritional 
losses 
including 
the 
impact 
of 
a 
change 
in 
the 
Company s 
 reinsurance program 
with an affiliate 
. 
The increase 
in current 
year attritional 
losses was mainly 
due to 
the growth 
 in premiums earned and the previously mentioned 

million of losses related to COVID-19 
in 2020. 

 The war 
in the 
Ukraine 
is ongoing 
and an 
evolving 
event. 
Economic 
and legal 
sanctions 
have 
been levied 
against 
 Russia, specific named individuals 
and entities connected 
to the Russian government, 
as well as businesses 
located 
 in the 
Russian Federation 
and/or owned 
by Russian 
nationals by 
numerous countries, 
including the 
United States. 
 The 
significant 
political 
and 
economic 
uncertainty 
surrounding 
the 
war 
and 
associated 
sanctions 
have 
impacted 
 economic 
and 
investment 
markets 
both 
within 
Russia 
and 
around 
the 
world. 
The 
Company 
has 
recorded 

million of incurred 
underwriting losses 
related to 
the Ukraine and 
Russia conflict for 
the year 
ended December 31, 
 2022. 
 Incurred 
prior 
years 
reserves 
increased 
by 

million, 

million 
and 

million 
in 
2022, 
2021 
and 
2020 
 respectively. 
The 
2022 
prior 
year 
development 
was 
primarily 
due 
to 

million 
of 
strengthening 
of 
asbestos 
 reserves 
mitigated 
primarily 
by 
reserve 
releases 
from 
the 
reinsurance 
segment. 
The 
increase 
for 
2021 
related 
 mainly to 
increases in 
insurance 
casualty reserves. 
The increase 
for 2020 
primarily related 
to higher 
ultimate loss 
 estimates 
for 
long-tail 
casualty 
business 
in 
the 
reinsurance 
segment 
for 
accident 
years 
2015 
to

notably 
 general liability, 
professional lines, and auto liability.

exposure 
groupings to 
develop reserve 
estimates. 
One 
 of the 
key 
selection 
characteristics 
for 
the exposure 
groupings 
is the 
historical 
duration 
of the 
claims 
settlement 
 process. 
Business in which claims are reported 
and settled relatively 
quickly are commonly referred 
to as short tail 
 lines, principally property 
lines. 
On the other 
hand, casualty 
claims tend 
to take 
longer to be 
reported and 
settled 
 and casualty lines 
are generally 
referred to 
as long tail 
lines. Estimates 
of ultimate losses 
for shorter tail 
lines, with 
 the 
exception 
of 
loss 
estimates 
for 
large 
catastrophic 
events, 
generally 
exhibit 
less 
volatility 
than 
those 
for 
the 
 longer tail lines. 

 The 
Company 
uses 
a 
variety 
of 
actuarial 
methodologies, 
such 
as 
the 
expected 
loss 
ratio 
method, 
chain 
ladder 
 methods, 
and 
Bornhuetter-Ferguson 
methods, 
supplemented 
by 
judgment 
where 
appropriate, 
to 
estimate 
 ultimate loss and LAE for each exposure 
group. 

 Expected Loss Ratio Method: 
The expected loss ratio method uses 
earned premium times an expected loss ratio 
to 
 calculate 
ultimate losses 
for a 
given underwriting 
or accident 
year. 
This method 
relies entirely 
on expectation 
to 
 project 
ultimate 
losses 
with 
no 
consideration 
given 
to 
actual 
losses. 
As 
such, 
it 
may 
be 
appropriate 
for 
an 
 immature underwriting or 
accident year where 
few, 
if any, 
losses have been 
reported or paid, 
but less appropriate 
 for a more mature year. 
 Chain Ladder Method: 
Chain ladder 
methods use 
a standard 
loss development 
triangle to 
project ultimate 
losses. 

 Age-to-age 
development 
factors 
are 
selected 
for 
each 
development 
period 
and 
combined 
to 
calculate 
age-to-
 ultimate 
development 
factors 
which 
are 
then 
applied 
to 
paid 
or 
reported 
losses 
to 
project 
ultimate 
losses. 
This 
 method 
relies 
entirely 
on 
actual 
paid 
or 
reported 
losses 
to 
project 
ultimate 
losses. 
No 
other 
factors 
such 
as 
 changes 
in 
pricing 
or 
other 
expectations 
are 
taken 
into 
account. 
It 
is 
most 
appropriate 
for 
groups 
with 
 homogeneous, 
stable 
experience 
where 
past 
development 
patterns 
are 
expected 
to 
continue 
in the 
future. 
It is 
 least appropriate for groups 
which have changed significantly 
over time or which are more volatile. 
 Bornhuetter-Ferguson 
Method: 
The 
Bornhuetter-Ferguson 
method 
is 
a 
combination 
of 
the 
expected 
loss 
ratio 
 method and the chain ladder 
method. 
Ultimate losses are projected 
based partly on actual paid 
or reported losses 
 and partly 
on expectation. 
Incurred but 
not reported 
(IBNR) reserves 
are calculated 
using earned 
premium, an 
a 
 priori 
loss 
ratio, 
and 
selected 
age-to-age 
development 
factors 
and 
added 
to 
actual 
reported 
(paid) 
losses 
to 
 determine 
ultimate 
losses. 
It is 
more responsive 
to actual 
reported 
or paid 
development 
than the 
expected 
loss 
 ratio 
method 
but 
less 
responsive 
than 
the 
chain 
ladder 
method. 
The 
reliability 
of 
the 
method 
depends 
on 
the 
 accuracy of the selected a priori loss ratio.

committees 
and 
many 
of 
these

from

The

which had 
a fair

billion at 
December 31, 
2022 and 

billion at 
December 31, 
2021. All 
prices for 
these securities 
were obtained 
 from publicly published sources or nationally 
recognized pricing vendors. 

 Equity 
securities 
denominated 
in 
U.S. 
currency 
with 
quoted 
prices 
in 
active 
markets 
for 
identical 
assets 
are 
 categorized 
as 
Level 
1 
since 
the 
quoted 
prices 
are 
directly 
observable. 
Equity 
securities 
traded 
on 
foreign 
 exchanges 
are categorized 
as Level 
2 due 
to the 
added input 
of a 
foreign 
exchange 
conversion 
rate 
to determine 
 fair value. 
The Company uses foreign currency exchange 
rates published by a nationally 
recognized 
source. 
 Fixed 
maturity securities 
listed 
in the 
tables have 
been categorized 
as Level 
2, since 
a particular 
security may 
not 
 have 
traded 
but 
the

services 
are 
able 
to 
use 
valuation 
models

market 
inputs 
such 
as 
 interest 
rate 
yield curves 
and prices 
for similar 
fixed maturity

maturity and 
seniority.

provided 
by 
the 
third 
party 
 pricing 
services 
in 
local 
currencies, 
and 
where 
applicable, 
are 
converted 
to 
U.S. 
dollars 
using 
currency 
exchange 
 rates from nationally recognized 
sources. 
 In addition 
to the 
valuations from 
investment 
managers, 
some of 
the fixed 
maturities with 
fair values 
categorized 
 as Level 3 result when prices are 
not available from the nationally 
recognized pricing services and are 
derived using 
 unobservable 
inputs. 
The 
Company 
will 
value 
the 
securities 
with 
unobservable 
inputs 
using 
comparable 
market 
 information 
or receive 
fair 
values 
from investment 
managers. 
The investment 
managers 
may 
obtain 
non-binding 
 price quotes 
for the 
securities from 
brokers. 
The single 
broker 
quotes are 
provided 
by market 
makers 
or broker-
 dealers 
who 
are 
recognized 
as 
market 
participants 
in 
the 
markets 
in 
which 
they 
are 
providing 
the 
quotes. 
The 
 prices received from brokers 
are reviewed for 
reasonableness by the third 
party asset managers and 
the Company. 

 If the broker quotes are for 
foreign denominated securities, 
the quotes are converted 
to U.S. dollars using currency 
 exchange rates from

million of 
the Company s 
deferred 
tax asset 
relates 
primarily to 
unrealized 
losses on 
 available for sale 
fixed maturity securities. 
The unrealized losses 
on available for sale 
fixed maturity securities 
were 
 a result of 
market conditions, 
including rising interest 
rates. Ultimate 
realization of 
the deferred 
tax asset 
depends 
 on 
the 
Company s 
ability 
and 
intent 
to 
hold 
the 
available 
for 
sale 
securities 
until 
they 
recover 
their 
value 
or 
 mature. 
As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
based 
on 
all 
the 
available 
evidence, 
the 
Company 
has 
concluded 
that 
the 
 deferred tax 
asset related to 
the unrealized losses 
on the available 
for sale fixed 
maturity portfolio are, 
more likely 
 than not, expect to be realized.
