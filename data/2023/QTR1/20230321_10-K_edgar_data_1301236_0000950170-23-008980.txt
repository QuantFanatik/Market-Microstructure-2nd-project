 PART I 
 Item 1. B usiness 
 Organization 
 Sotherly Hotels Inc. (the Company is a self-managed and self-administered lodging real estate investment trust, or REIT, that was formed in August 2004 to own, acquire, renovate and reposition full-service, primarily upscale and upper-upscale hotel properties located in primary markets in the mid-Atlantic and southern United States. On December 21, 2004, the Company successfully completed its initial public offering and elected to be treated as a self-advised REIT for federal income tax purposes. The Company conducts its business through Sotherly Hotels LP, its operating partnership (the Operating Partnership ), of which the Company is the general partner. As of the filing date, the Company owns approximately 95.8 of the general and limited partnership units in the Operating Partnership. Limited partners own the remaining Operating Partnership units. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio consisted of ten full-service, primarily upscale and upper-upscale hotels located in seven states with an aggregate of 2,786 hotel rooms, and interests in two condominium hotels and their associated rental programs. All of our hotels are wholly-owned by subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership and are managed on a day-to-day basis by Our Town Hospitality, LLC Our Town ). Our portfolio is concentrated in markets that we believe possess multiple demand generators and have significant barriers to entry for new product delivery, which are important factors for us in identifying hotel properties that we expect will be capable of providing strong risk-adjusted returns. 
 In order for the Company to qualify as a REIT, it cannot directly manage or operate our hotels. Therefore, we lease our wholly-owned hotel properties to entities that we refer to as our TRS Lessees , which are wholly-owned subsidiaries of MHI Hospitality TRS Holding, Inc. MHI Holding , and collectively with the TRS Lessees, the MHI TRS Entities ). The MHI TRS Entities, in turn, have engaged Our Town, which is an eligible independent management company, to manage the day-to-day operations at our hotels. MHI Holding is a taxable REIT subsidiary TRS for federal income tax purposes. 
 Our corporate office is located at 306 South Henry Street, Suite 100, Williamsburg, Virginia 23185. Our telephone number is (757) 229-5648. 
 Our Properties 
 As of December 31, 2022, our hotels were located in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Texas. Seven of these hotels operate under franchise agreements with major hotel brands, and three are independent hotels. We also own the hotel commercial condominium units of the Hyde Resort Residences and Hyde Beach House Resort Residences condominium hotels. We closed the sale of the Sheraton Louisville Riverside on February 10, 2022 and the sale of the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone-University on June 10, 2022. See Item 2 in Part I and Item 7 in Part II of this Form 10-K for additional detail on our properties. 
 Our Strategy and Investment Criteria 
 Our strategy is to grow through acquisitions of full-service, upscale and upper-upscale hotel properties located in the primary markets of the southern United States. Sotherly may also opportunistically acquire hotels throughout other regions of the United States. We intend to grow our portfolio through disciplined acquisitions of hotel properties and believe that we will be able to source significant external growth opportunities through our management team s extensive network of industry, corporate and institutional relationships. Current market conditions and the terms of our loan agreements limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy, but as economic conditions improve and demand and consumer confidence increase, we intend to position the Company to execute on our growth strategy. We are not subject to limitations on the amount or percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property. Additionally, no limits have been set on the concentration of investments in any one location or facility type. Our policy is to acquire assets primarily for income and long-term appreciation. 
 6 
 
 Our investment criteria are further detailed below: 
 Geographic Growth Markets: Our growth strategy focuses on the major markets in the Southern region of the United States. Our management team remains confident in the long-term growth potential associated with this part of the United States. We believe these markets have, during the Company s and our predecessors existence, been characterized by population growth, economic expansion, growth in new businesses and growth in the resort, recreation and leisure segments. We will continue to focus on these markets, including coastal locations, and will investigate other markets for acquisitions only if we believe these new markets will provide similar long-term growth prospects. Sotherly may also opportunistically acquire hotels throughout the United States. 

Full-Service Hotels: Our acquisition strategy focuses on the full-service hotel segment. Our full-service hotels fall primarily under the upscale to upper-upscale categories and include such brands as Hilton, Doubletree by Hilton, and Hyatt, as well as independent hotels. We may also acquire commercial unit(s) within upscale to upper-upscale condominium hotel projects, allowing us to establish and operate unit rental programs. We do not own limited service or extended-stay hotels. We believe that full-service hotels, in the upscale to upper-upscale categories, will outperform the broader U.S. hotel industry, and thus offer the highest returns on invested capital. Sotherly may also opportunistically acquire hotels outside of the full-service, upscale or upper-upscale category. 

Significant Barriers to Entry: We intend to execute a strategy that focuses on the acquisition of hotels in prime locations with significant barriers to entry. 

Proximity to Demand Generators: We seek to acquire hotel properties located in central business districts for both leisure and business travelers within the respective markets, including large state universities, airports, convention centers, corporate headquarters, sports venues and office buildings. We seek to be in walking locations that are proximate to the markets major demand generators. 

We generally have a bias toward acquiring underperforming hotels, which we typically define as those that are poorly managed, suffer from significant deferred maintenance and capital investment and that are not properly positioned in their respective markets. In pursuing these opportunities, we hope to improve revenue and cash flow and increase the long-term value of the underperforming hotels we acquire. Our ultimate goal is to achieve a total investment that is substantially less than replacement cost of a hotel or the acquisition cost of a market performing hotel. In analyzing a potential investment in an underperforming hotel property, we typically characterize the investment opportunity as one of the following: 
 Branding Opportunity: The acquisition of properties that includes a repositioning of the property through a change in brand affiliation, which may include positioning the property as an independent hotel. Branding opportunities typically include physical upgrades and enhanced efficiencies brought about by changes in operations. 

Shallow-Turn Opportunity: The acquisition of an underperforming but structurally sound hotel that requires moderate renovation to re-establish the hotel in its market. 

Deep-Turn Opportunity: The acquisition of a hotel that is closed or functionally obsolete and requires a restructuring of both the business components of the operations as well as the physical plant of the hotel, including extensive renovation of the building, furniture, fixtures and equipment. 

Typically, in our experience, a deep turn opportunity takes a total of approximately four years from the initial acquisition of a property to achieving full post-renovation stabilization. Therefore, when evaluating future opportunities in underperforming hotels, we intend to focus on up-branding and shallow-turn opportunities, and to pursue deep-turn opportunities on a more limited basis and in joint venture partnerships, if possible. 
 Investment Vehicles. In pursuit of our investment strategy, we may employ various traditional and non-traditional investment vehicles: 
 Direct Purchase Opportunity: Our traditional investment strategy is to acquire direct ownership interests via our Operating Partnership in properties that meet our investment criteria, including opportunities that involve full-service, upscale and upper-upscale properties in identified geographic growth markets that have significant barriers to entry for new product delivery. Such properties, or portfolio of properties, may or may not be acquired subject to a mortgage, or other financing or lending instruments, by the seller or third-party. 

Joint Venture/Mezzanine Lending Opportunities: We may, from time to time, undertake a significant renovation and rehabilitation project that we characterize as a deep-turn opportunity. In such cases, we may acquire a functionally obsolete hotel whose renovation may be very lengthy and require significant capital. In these projects, we may choose to structure such acquisitions as a joint venture, or mezzanine lending program, in order to avoid severe short-term dilution and loss of current income commonly referred to as the negative carry associated with such extensive renovation 

7 
 
 programs. We will not pursue joint venture or mezzanine programs in which we would become a de facto lender to the real estate community. 

Investments in Mortgages, Structured Financings and Other Lending Policies: In sourcing acquisitions for our core turnaround growth strategy, we may pursue investments in debt instruments that are collateralized by underperforming hotel properties. In certain circumstances, we believe that owning these debt instruments is a way to (i) ultimately acquire the underlying real estate asset and (ii) provide a non-dilutive current return to the Company s stockholders in the form of interest payments derived from the ownership of the debt. Our principal goal in pursuing distressed debt opportunities is ultimately to acquire the underlying real estate. By owning the debt, we believe that we may be in a position to acquire deeds to properties that fit our investment criteria in lieu of foreclosures. We do not have a policy limiting our ability to invest in loans secured by properties or to make loans to other persons. We may consider offering purchase money financing in connection with the sale of properties where the provision of that financing will increase the value to be received by us for the property sold. We may make loans to joint ventures in which we may participate in the future. However, neither Sotherly nor the Operating Partnership intend to engage in significant lending activities. 

Portfolio and Asset Management Strategy 
 We intend to ensure that the management of our hotel properties maximizes market share, as evidenced by revenue per available room RevPAR penetration indices, and that our market share yields the optimum level of revenues for our hotels in their respective markets. Our strategy is designed to actively monitor our hotels operating expenses in an effort to maximize hotel earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization Hotel EBITDA ). 
 Over our long history in the lodging industry, we have refined many portfolio and asset management techniques that we believe provide for exceptional cash returns at our hotels. We undertake extensive budgeting due diligence wherein we examine market trends, one-time or exceptional revenue opportunities, and/or changes in the regulatory climate that may impact costs. We review daily revenue results and revenue management strategies at the hotels, and we focus on our managers ability to produce high quality revenues that translate to higher profit margins. We look for ancillary forms of revenues, such as leasing roof-top space for cellular towers and other communication devices and also look to lease space to third parties in our hotels, which may include, but are not limited to, gift shops or restaurants. We have and will continue to engage parking management companies to maximize parking revenue. Our efforts further include periodic review of property insurance costs and coverage, and the cost of real and personal property taxes. We generally appeal tax increases in an effort to secure lower tax payments and routinely pursue strategies that allow for lower overall insurance costs, such as purchasing re-insurance. 
 We also require detailed and refined reporting data from our hotel manager, which includes detailed accounts of revenues, revenue segments, expenses and forecasts based on current and historic booking patterns. We also believe we optimize and successfully manage capital costs at our hotels while ensuring that adequate product standards are maintained to provide a positive guest experience. 
 None of our hotels are managed by a major national or global hotel franchise company. Through our long history in the lodging industry, we have found that management of our hotels by management companies other than franchisors is preferable to and more profitable than management services provided by the major franchise companies, specifically with respect to optimization of operating expenses and the delivery of guest service. 
 Our portfolio management strategy includes efforts to optimize labor costs. Our third-party hotel manager is responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels. Although we do not directly employ or manage employees at our hotels, we monitor our hotel manager and make recommendations regarding the operation of our hotels. The labor force in our hotels is predominately non-unionized, with only one property, the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront, having approximately 86 employees electing to participate under a collective bargaining arrangement. Further, the employees at our hotels that are managed by Our Town are eligible to receive health and other insurance coverage through Our Town, which self-insures. Self-insuring has, in our opinion and experience, provided significant savings over traditional insurance company sponsored plans. 
 Asset Disposition Strategy. When a property no longer fits with our investment objectives, we will pursue a direct sale of the property for cash so that our investment capital can be redeployed according to the investment strategies outlined above. Where possible, we will seek to subsequently purchase a hotel in connection with the requirements of a tax-free exchange. Such a strategy may be deployed in order to mitigate the tax consequence that a direct sale may cause.

Agreements with Our Town . Our Town is the management company for each of our twelve wholly-owned hotels, as well as the manager for our two condominium rental programs. As of March 15, 2022, an affiliate of Andrew M. Sims, our Chairman, an affiliate of David R. Folsom, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Andrew M. Sims Jr., our Vice President - Operations Investor Relations, beneficially owned approximately 63.0 , 7.0 , and 15.0 , respectively, of the total outstanding ownership interests in Our Town. Mr. Sims, Mr. Folsom, and Mr. Sims Jr. serve as directors of Our Town. 
 On September 6, 2019, we entered into a master agreement with Our Town and the former majority owner of Our Town related to the management of certain of our hotels, as amended on December 13, 2019 (as amended, the OTH Master Agreement ). On December 13, 2019, and subsequent dates we entered into a series of individual hotel management agreements for the management of our hotels. Those hotel management agreements for our ten wholly-owned hotels and the two rental programs are each referred to as an OTH Hotel Management Agreement and, together, the OTH Hotel Management Agreements . 
 The OTH Master Agreement: 
 expires on March 31, 2035, or earlier if all of the OTH Hotel Management Agreements expire or are terminated prior to that date. The OTH Master Agreement shall be extended beyond 2035 for such additional periods as an OTH Hotel Management Agreement remains in effect; 

requires Our Town to provide dedicated executive level support for our managed hotels pursuant to certain criteria; 

sets an incentive management fee for each of the hotels managed by Our Town equal to 10 of the amount by which gross operating profit, as defined in the OTH Hotel Management Agreements, for a given year exceeds the budgeted gross operating profit for such year; provided, however, that the incentive management fee payable in respect of any such year shall not exceed 0.25 of the gross revenues of the hotel included in such calculation; 

provides for an adjustment to the fees payable by us under the OTH Hotel Management Agreements in the event the net operating income of Our Town falls below 250,000 for any calendar year beginning on or after January 1, 2021; 

provides a mechanism and establishes conditions on which the Company will offer Our Town the opportunity to manage hotels acquired by the Company in the future, pursuant to a negotiated form of single facility management agreement, with the caveat that the Company is not required to offer the management of future hotels to Our Town; and 

9 
 
 sets a base management fee for future hotels of 2.00 for the first year of the term, 2.25 for the second year of the term, and 2.50 for the third and any additional years of the term. 

Each of the OTH Hotel Management Agreements has an initial term ending March 31, 2035. Each of the OTH Hotel Management Agreements may be extended for up to two additional periods of five years subject to the approval of both parties with respect to any such extension. The agreements provide that Our Town will be the sole and exclusive manager of the hotels as the agent of the respective TRS Lessee, at the sole cost and expense of the TRS Lessee, and subject to certain operating standards. Each OTH Hotel Management Agreement may be terminated in connection with a sale of the related hotel. In connection with a termination upon the sale of the hotel, Our Town will be entitled to receive a termination fee equal to the lesser of the management fee paid with respect to the prior twelve months or the management fees paid for that number of months prior to the closing date of the hotel sale equal to the number of months remaining on the current term of the OTH Hotel Management Agreement. Upon the sale of a hotel, no termination fee will be due in the event the Company elects to provide Our Town with the opportunity to manage another comparable hotel and Our Town is not precluded from accepting such opportunity. Our Town is required to qualify as an eligible independent contractor in order to permit the Company to continue to operate as a real estate investment trust. 
 Pursuant to the management agreements for the Hyde Resort Residences and the Hyde Beach House Resort Residences, Our Town manages the rental of individually owned condominium units pursuant to rental agreements entered into with individual condominium unit owners. We have also entered into an Association Sub Management and Assignment Agreement with Our Town for the management and operation of the condominium association responsible for the operation of the Hyde Beach House Resort Residences, and a Rental Sales Management Agreement pursuant to which Our Town agreed to manage the marketing and negotiation of rental agreements with individual condominium unit owners. 
 Franchise Agreements 
 As of December 31, 2022, all but three of our wholly-owned hotels operate under franchise licenses from national hotel companies. As our franchise agreements expire, we will continue to evaluate each hotel on a case-by-case basis and decide whether to re-license with the existing franchisor, re-brand and license with a new franchisor, or re-brand as an independent hotel. We also periodically review our independent hotels to determine whether they would be better served by operating under a franchise license. 
 Our TRS Lessees hold the franchise licenses for our wholly-owned hotels. Our hotel manager must operate each of our hotels they manage in accordance with and pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreement for the hotel. 
 The franchise licenses generally specify certain management, operational, record keeping, accounting, reporting and marketing standards and procedures with which the franchisee must comply. Under the franchise licenses, the franchisee must comply with the franchisors standards and requirements with respect to: 
 training of operational personnel; 

safety; 

maintaining specified insurance; 

the types of services and products ancillary to guest room services that may be provided; 

display of signage; 

marketing standards including print media, billboards, and promotions standards; and 

the type, quality and age of furniture, fixtures and equipment included in guest rooms, lobbies and other common areas. 

As the franchisee, our TRS Lessees are required to pay franchise/royalty fees, as well as certain other fees for marketing and reservations services in amounts that range from approximately 3.0 to 4.0 of gross revenues. The following table sets forth certain information for the franchise licenses of our wholly-owned hotel properties as of December 31, 2022:

 Lease Agreements 
 	TRS Leases 
 In order for the Company to maintain qualification as a REIT, neither the Company nor the Operating Partnership or its subsidiaries can operate our hotels directly. Our wholly-owned hotels are leased to our TRS Lessees, which have engaged a third-party management company to manage the hotels. Each lease has a non-cancelable term ranging from four to thirty years, subject to earlier termination upon the occurrence of certain contingencies described in the lease. 
 During the term of each lease, our TRS Lessees are obligated to pay a fixed annual base rent plus a percentage rent and certain other additional charges. Base rent accrues and is paid monthly. Percentage rent is calculated by multiplying fixed percentages by gross room revenues, in excess of certain threshold amounts and is paid monthly or quarterly, according to the terms of the agreement. 
 	Other Leases 
 We lease the land underlying the Hyatt Centric Arlington hotel pursuant to a ground lease. The ground lease requires us to make rental payments of 50,000 per year in base rent and percentage rent equal to 3.5 of gross room revenue in excess of certain thresholds, as defined in the ground lease agreement. The ground lease contains a rent reset provision that will reset the rent in June 2025 to a fixed amount per annum equal to 8.0 of the land value, subject to an appraisal process. The initial term of the ground lease expires in 2035 and may be extended by us for four additional renewal periods of 10 years each. In order to sell the Hyatt Centric Arlington hotel and assign our leasehold interest in the ground lease, we are required to obtain the consent of the third-party lessor. 
 In connection with the acquisition of the Hyde Beach House Resort Residences hotel commercial condominium unit, we entered into a 20-year parking and cabana management agreement for the parking garage and poolside cabanas associated with the resort. In exchange for rights to the parking and cabana revenue, we pay the condominium association an annual payment of 271,000 for the initial five years of the term, with 5.0 increases on every fifth year of the term. 
 We lease approximately 8,500 square feet of commercial office space in Williamsburg, Virginia for our corporate offices, under an agreement with a ten-year term beginning January 1, 2020. The initial annual rent under the agreement is 218,875, with the rent for each successive annual period increasing by 3.0 over the prior annual period s rent. The annual rent was offset by a tenant improvement allowance of 200,000, applied against one-half of each monthly rent payment until the tenant improvement allowance was exhausted in 2021. 
 Tax Status 
 The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2004. In order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, the Company must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute, as qualifying distributions, at least 90.0 of its taxable income (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and by excluding its net capital gains and reduced by certain non-cash items) to its stockholders. The Company has adhered to these requirements each taxable year since its formation in 2004 and intends to continue to adhere to these requirements and maintain its qualification for taxation as a REIT. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of its taxable income (including its net capital gain) that is distributed to its stockholders. If the Company fails to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, and no relief provision applies, it will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates and it would be disqualified from re-electing treatment as a REIT until the fifth taxable year after the year in which it failed to 
 11 
 
 qualify as a REIT. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable income. In addition, taxable income from non-REIT activities managed through taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, is subject to federal, state and local income taxes. 
 While the Operating Partnership is generally not subject to federal and state income taxes, the unit holders of the Operating Partnership, including the Company, are subject to tax on their respective allocable shares of the Operating Partnership s taxable income. 
 The Company has one TRS, MHI Holding, in which it owns an interest through the Operating Partnership. MHI Holding is subject to federal, state and local income taxes. MHI Holding has operated at a cumulative taxable loss, through December 31, 2022, of approximately 41.7 million and deferred timing differences of approximately 1.7 million attributable to accrued, but not deductible, vacation and sick pay amounts, business interest, depreciation and other timing differences. The Company has not incurred federal income taxes since its formation. During the first quarter of 2020, we reduced our deferred tax assets through the establishment of a 100 valuation allowance of approximately 5.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we increased the valuation allowance to approximately 14.7 million and increased it again during the year ended December 31, 2021 to approximately 14.9 million and in 2022 we reduced the valuation allowance by approximately 3.7 million to approximately 11.2 million. 
 Environmental Matters 
 In connection with the ownership and operation of the hotels, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations relating to environmental protection. Under these laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on, under, or in such property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, the presence of contamination from hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remediate such contaminated property properly, may adversely affect the owner s ability to borrow using such property as collateral. Furthermore, a person who arranges for the disposal or treatment of a hazardous or toxic substance at a property owned by another, or who transports such substance to or from such property, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substance released into the environment at the disposal or treatment facility. The costs of remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances may adversely affect the owner s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral. In connection with the ownership and operation of the hotels, we may be potentially liable for such costs. 
 We believe that our hotels are in compliance, in all material respects, with all federal, state and local environmental ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters, the violation of which would have a material adverse effect on us. We have not received written notice from any governmental authority of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of our present hotel properties. 
 Employees and Human Capital 
 As of December 31, 2022, we employed nine full-time persons, all of whom work at our corporate office in Williamsburg, Virginia. We believe relations with our employees are positive. Our human capital resources objectives include attracting and retaining talented and well-qualified employees. Our compensation program, including competitive salaries and other benefits, are designed to attract, hire, retain and motivate highly qualified employees and executives. We are committed to enhancing our culture through efforts to promote and preserve inclusion and by providing and maintaining a safe work environment. All persons employed in the day-to-day operations of each of our hotels are employees of our third-party hotel manager engaged by our TRS Lessees to operate such hotels.

 DETAIL 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Properties 
 We own a limited number of hotels and significant adverse changes at one hotel could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and may limit our ability to make distributions to stockholders. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio consisted of ten wholly-owned hotels with a total of 2,786 rooms and the hotel commercial condominium units of the Hyde Resort Residences and the Hyde Beach House Resort Residences condominium hotels. Significant adverse changes in the operations of any one hotel could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and, accordingly, on our ability to make distributions to stockholders. 
 We are subject to risks of increased hotel operating expenses and decreased hotel revenues. 
 Our leases with our TRS Lessees provide for the payment of rent based in part on gross revenues from our hotels. Our TRS Lessees are subject to hotel operating risks including decreased hotel revenues and increased hotel operating expenses, including but not limited to the following: 
 wage and benefit costs; 

repair and maintenance expenses; 

energy costs; 

insurance costs; and 

other operating expenses. 

Any increases in these operating expenses can have a significant adverse impact on our TRS Lessees ability to pay rent and other operating expenses and, consequently, our earnings and cash flow. 
 In keeping with our investment strategy, we may acquire, renovate and/or re-brand hotels in new or existing geographic markets as part of our repositioning strategy. Unanticipated expenses and insufficient demand for newly repositioned hotels could adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to comply with loan covenants and to make distributions to the Company s stockholders. 
 We have in the past, and may in the future, develop or acquire hotels in geographic areas in which our management may have little or no operating experience. Additionally, those properties may also be renovated and re-branded as part of a repositioning strategy. Potential customers may not be familiar with our newly renovated hotel or be aware of the brand change. As a result, we may have to incur costs relating to the opening, operation and promotion of those new hotel properties that are substantially greater than those incurred in other geographic areas. These hotels may attract fewer customers than expected and we may choose to increase spending on advertising and marketing to promote the hotel and increase customer demand. Unanticipated expenses and insufficient demand at new hotel properties, therefore, could adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to comply with loan covenants and to make distributions to the Company s stockholders. 
 We do not have the authority to require any hotel to be operated in a particular manner or to govern any particular aspect of the daily operations of any hotel and as a result, our returns are dependent on the management of our hotels by our hotel management company. 
 Since federal income tax laws restrict REITs and their subsidiaries from operating or managing hotels, we do not operate or manage our hotels. Instead, we lease all of our hotels to our TRS Lessees, and our TRS Lessees retain managers to operate our hotels pursuant to management agreements. All of our hotels are managed by Our Town. 
 Under the terms of our management agreements with our hotel manager and the REIT qualification rules, our ability to participate in operating decisions regarding the hotels is limited. We will depend on our hotel manager to operate our hotels as provided in the management agreements. We do not have the authority to require any hotel to be operated in a particular manner or to govern any particular aspect of the daily operations of any hotel. Thus, even if we believe our hotels are being operated inefficiently or in a manner that does not result in satisfactory occupancy rates, RevPAR, and average daily rates ADR ), we may not be able to force a hotel management company to change its method of operating our hotels. Additionally, in the event that we need to replace a hotel management company in the future, we may be required by the terms of the applicable management agreement to pay substantial termination fees and may experience significant disruptions at the affected hotels. 
 15 
 
 Our ability to make distributions to the Company s stockholders is subject to fluctuations in our financial performance, operating results and capital improvement requirements. 
 As a REIT, the Company is required to distribute, as qualifying distributions, at least 90.0 of its REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and by excluding its net capital gains, and reduced by certain noncash items), each year to the Company s stockholders. However, several factors may make us unable to declare or pay distributions to the Company s stockholders, including poor operating results and financial performance or unanticipated capital improvements to our hotels, including capital improvements that may be required by our franchisors. 
 We lease all of our hotels to our TRS Lessees. Our TRS Lessees are subject to hotel operating risks, including risks of sustaining operating losses after payment of hotel operating expenses, including management fees. Among the factors which could cause our TRS Lessees to fail to make required rent payments are reduced net operating profits or operating losses, increased debt service requirements and capital expenditures at our hotels, including capital expenditures required by the franchisors of our hotels. Among the factors that could reduce the net operating profits of our TRS Lessees are decreases in hotel revenues and increases in hotel operating expenses. Hotel revenue can decrease for a number of reasons, including increased competition from a new supply of hotel rooms and decreased demand for hotel rooms. These factors can reduce both occupancy and room rates at our hotels and limit the volume of food and beverage revenue and other operating revenue such as parking revenue. 
 The declaration of distributions to holders of our securities is subject to the sole discretion of the Company s board of directors, which will consider, among other factors, our financial performance, debt service obligations, debt covenants and capital expenditure requirements. We cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash to fund distributions. We did not pay any dividend distributions following the payment of dividends in March 2020 through the end of 2022. 
 Geographic concentration of our hotels makes our business vulnerable to economic downturns in the mid-Atlantic and southern United States. 
 Our hotels are located in the mid-Atlantic and southern United States. As a result, economic conditions in the mid-Atlantic and southern United States significantly affect our revenues and the value of our hotels to a greater extent than if we had a more geographically diversified portfolio. Business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics and other similar factors that may adversely affect the economic climate in these areas could have a significant adverse impact on our business. Any resulting oversupply or reduced demand for hotels in the mid-Atlantic and southern United States and in our markets in particular would therefore have a disproportionate negative impact on our revenues and limit our ability to make distributions to stockholders. 
 A substantial number of our hotels operate under brands owned by Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.( Hilton therefore, we are subject to risks associated with concentrating our portfolio in one brand. We also own a hotel operated under the brand owned by Hyatt Hotels Corporation Hyatt ). 
 In our portfolio, the majority of the hotels that we owned as of December 31, 2022, utilize brands owned by Hilton. As a result, our success is dependent in part on the continued success of Hilton and their respective brands. If market recognition or the positive perception of Hilton is reduced or compromised, the goodwill associated with the Hilton branded hotels in our portfolio may be adversely affected, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. As of March 1, 2023, we owned one property that utilizes a brand owned by Hyatt. Our success is also dependent in part on the continued success, market recognition, and positive perception of these brands. 
 Our ground lease for the Hyatt Centric Arlington may constrain us from acting in the best interest of stockholders or require us to make certain payments. 
 The Hyatt Centric Arlington is subject to a ground lease with a third-party lessor which requires us to obtain the consent of the relevant third-party lessor in order to sell the Hyatt Centric Arlington hotel or to assign our leasehold interest in the ground lease. Accordingly, we may be prevented from completing such a transaction if we are unable to obtain the required consent from the lessor, even if we determine that the sale of this hotel or the assignment of our leasehold interest in the ground lease is in the best interest of the Company or our stockholders. In addition, at any given time, potential purchasers may be less interested in buying a hotel subject to a ground lease and may demand a lower price for the hotel than for a comparable property without such a restriction, or they may not purchase the hotel at any price. For these reasons, we may have a difficult time selling the hotel or may receive lower proceeds from any such sale. The ground lease is subject to four additional renewal periods of 10 years each, following the first renewal period which expires in 2035. At the beginning of each renewal period, certain provisions of the lease may be adjusted by the lessor, which could impact payments we are required to make to the lessor. The ground lease contains a rent reset provision that will reset the rent in June 2025 to a fixed amount per annum equal to 8.0 of the land value, subject to an appraisal process. If we are not able to come to reasonable terms with the lessor at the end of the term or if we are found to have breached certain obligations under the ground lease, the hotel may suffer a substantial decline in value and we may be forced to dispose of the hotel at a substantial loss. 
 16 
 
 Hedging against interest rate exposure may adversely affect us and our hedges may fail to protect us from the losses that the hedges were designed to offset. 
 Subject to maintaining the Company s qualification as a REIT, we may elect to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements, such as cap agreements and swap agreements. These agreements involve the risks that these arrangements may fail to protect or adversely affect us because, among other things: 
 interest rate hedging can be expensive, particularly during periods of rising and volatile interest rates; 

available interest rate hedges may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought; 

the financial instruments we select may not have the effect of reducing our interest rate risk; 

the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability; 

the credit quality of the hedging counterparty owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction; and 

the hedging counterparty owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay. 

As a result of any of the foregoing, our hedging transactions, which are intended to limit losses, may fail to protect us from the losses that the hedges were designed to offset and could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Our investment opportunities and growth prospects may be affected by competition for acquisitions. 
 We compete for investment opportunities with other entities, some of which have substantially greater financial resources than we do. This competition may generally limit the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us, which may limit our ability to grow. This competition may also increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell to us, making it more difficult for us to acquire new properties on attractive terms, or at all. 
 If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately determine our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, the Company s stockholders could lose confidence in our financial results, which could harm our business and the value of the Company s shares. 
 Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal controls over financial reporting. Our internal controls and financial reporting are not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. While we have undertaken substantial work to maintain effective internal controls, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in maintaining adequate internal controls over our financial reporting and financial processes in the future. In the future, we may discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement. Furthermore, as we grow our business, our internal controls will become more complex, and we will require significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective. If we or our independent auditors discover a material weakness, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, could reduce the market value of the Company s shares and make it more difficult for the Company to raise capital. Additionally, the existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner. 
 We and our hotel manager rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business. 
 We and our hotel manager rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, personal identifying information, reservations, billing and operating data. We and our hotel manager purchase some of our information technology from vendors, on whom our systems depend. We and our hotel manager rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential operator and other customer information, such as individually identifiable information, including information relating to financial accounts. Although we and our hotel manager have taken steps, we believe are necessary to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems, it is possible that the safety and security measures taken will not be able to prevent the systems improper functioning or damage, or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Any failure to maintain proper functionality, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our hotel 
 17 
 
 manager carries cyber insurance policies to protect and offset a portion of potential costs incurred from a security breach. Additionally, we currently have cyber insurance policies to provide supplemental coverage above the coverage carried by our third-party manager. Despite various precautionary steps to protect our hotels from losses resulting from cyber-attacks, any cyber-attack occurrence could still result in losses at our properties, which could affect our results of operations. We are not aware of any cyber incidents that we believe to be material or that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also rely on the reservation systems of our brand partners and those systems may be hacked or subject to denial of service attacks. 
 We face possible risks associated with natural disasters and the physical effects of climate change. 
 We are subject to the risks associated with natural disasters and the physical effects of climate change, which can include more frequent or severe storms, droughts, hurricanes and flooding, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our hotels, operations and business. Over time, our coastal markets are expected to experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea-levels causing damage to our properties. As a result, we could become subject to significant losses and/or repair costs that may or may not be fully covered by insurance. Other markets may experience prolonged variations in temperature or precipitation that may limit access to the water needed to operate our hotels or significantly increase energy costs, which may subject those hotels to additional regulatory burdens, such as limitations on water usage or stricter energy efficiency standards. Climate change also may affect our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable in areas most vulnerable to such events, increasing operating costs at our hotels, such as the cost of water or energy, and requiring us to expend funds as we seek to repair and protect our hotels against such risks. There can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on our hotels, operations or business. 
 Risks Related to the Lodging Industry 
 If the economy falls into a recessionary period or fails to maintain positive growth, our operating performance and financial results may be harmed by declines in occupancy, average daily room rates and/or other operating revenues. 
 The performance of the lodging industry and the general economy historically have been closely linked. In an economic downturn, business and leisure travelers may seek to reduce costs by limiting travel and/or reducing costs on their trips. Our hotels, which are all full-service hotels, may be more susceptible to a decrease in revenue, as compared to hotels in other categories that have lower room rates. A decrease in demand for hotel stays and hotel services, such as the decrease experienced due to COVID-19, will negatively affect our operating revenues, which will lower our cash flow and may affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to maintain compliance with our loan obligations. An economic downturn, such as the once caused by COVID-19, may result in losses or reduce our income in the future. A weakening of the economy may adversely and materially affect our industry, business and results of operations and we cannot predict the likelihood, severity or duration of any such downturn. Moreover, reduced revenues as a result of a weakening economy may also reduce our working capital and impact our long-term business strategy. 
 Our ability to comply with the terms of our loan covenants, our ability to make distributions to the Company s stockholders and the value of our hotels in general, may be adversely affected by factors in the lodging industry. 
 Operating Risks 
 Our hotel properties are subject to various operating risks common to the lodging industry, many of which are beyond our control, including the following: 
 competition from other hotel properties in our markets; 

over-building of hotels in our markets, which adversely affects occupancy and revenues at our hotels; 

dependence on business and commercial travelers and tourism; 

increases in energy costs and other expenses affecting travel, which may affect travel patterns and reduce the number of business and commercial travelers and tourists; 

increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors, including increases in labor costs, that may not be offset by increased room rates; 

changes in interest rates and in the availability, cost and terms of debt financing; 

changes in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations, fiscal policies and ordinances; 

adverse effects of international, national, regional and local economic and market conditions; 

18 
 
 adverse effects of a downturn in the lodging industry; and 

risks generally associated with the ownership of hotel properties and real estate, as we discuss in detail below. 

These factors could reduce the net income of our TRS Lessees, which in turn could adversely affect the value of our hotels and our ability to comply with the terms of the indenture and to make distributions to the Company s stockholders. 
 Seasonality of the Hotel Business 
 The lodging industry is seasonal in nature, which can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues. Our quarterly earnings may be adversely affected by factors outside our control, including weather conditions and poor economic factors. As a result, we may have to enter into short-term borrowings in certain quarters in order to offset these fluctuations in revenues and to make distributions to the Company s stockholders. 
 Investment Concentration in Particular Segments of a Single Industry 
 Our entire business is lodging-related. Therefore, a downturn in the lodging industry, in general, and the full-service, upscale and upper-upscale segments in which we operate, in particular, will have a material adverse effect on the value of our hotels, our financial condition and the extent to which cash may be available for distribution to the Company s stockholders. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Our hotel properties have an ongoing need for renovations and other capital improvements, including replacements, from time to time, of furniture, fixtures and equipment. The franchisors of our hotels also require us to make periodic capital improvements as a condition of keeping the franchise licenses. In addition, several of our mortgage lenders require that we set aside amounts for capital improvements to the secured properties on a monthly basis. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we spent approximately 8.0 million and approximately 3.2 million, respectively, on capital improvements to our hotels. Capital improvements and renovation projects may give rise to the following risks: 
 possible environmental problems; 

construction cost overruns and delays; 

a possible shortage of available cash to fund capital improvements and the related possibility that financing for these capital improvements may not be available to us on affordable terms; and 

uncertainties as to market demand or a loss of market demand after capital improvements have begun. 

The costs of all these capital improvements as well as future capital improvements could adversely affect our financial condition and amounts available for distribution to the Company s stockholders. 
 Operating our hotels under franchise agreements could increase our operating costs and lower our net income. 
 Most of our hotels operate under franchise agreements which subject us to risks in the event of negative publicity related to one of our franchisors. 
 The maintenance of the franchise licenses for our hotels is subject to our franchisors operating standards and other terms and conditions. Many operating standards and other terms can be modified or expanded at the sole discretion of the franchisor. Our franchisors periodically inspect our hotels to ensure that we, our TRS Lessees, and the management companies follow their standards. Failure by us, our TRS Lessees or a management company to maintain these standards or other terms and conditions could result in a franchise license being canceled. If a franchise license terminates due to our failure to make required improvements or to otherwise comply with its terms, we may also be liable to the franchisor for a termination payment, which varies by franchisor and by hotel. As a condition of continuing a franchise license, a franchisor may require us to make capital expenditures, even if we do not believe the capital improvements are necessary or desirable or will result in an acceptable return on our investment. Nonetheless, we may risk losing a franchise license if we do not make franchisor-required capital expenditures. 
 If a franchisor terminates the franchise license, we may try either to obtain a suitable replacement franchise license or to operate the hotel without a franchise license. The loss of a franchise license could significantly decrease the revenues at the hotel and reduce the underlying value of the hotel because of the loss of associated name recognition, marketing support and centralized reservation systems provided by the franchisor. A loss of a franchise license for one or more hotels could materially and adversely affect our revenues. This loss of revenues could, therefore, also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, our ability to comply with the terms of the loan covenants and reduce our cash available for distribution to stockholders. 
 19 
 
 Restrictive covenants in certain of our franchise agreements contain provisions that may operate to limit our ability to sell or refinance our hotels, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Franchise agreements typically contain covenants that may affect our ability to sell or refinance a hotel, including requirements to obtain the consent of the franchisor in the event of such a sale or refinancing transaction. In the event that a franchisor s consent is not forthcoming, the terms of a sale or refinancing may be less favorable to us than would otherwise be the case. Some of our franchise agreements provide the franchisor with a right of first offer in the event of certain sales or transfers of a hotel and provide that the franchisor has the right to approve any change in the hotel management company engaged to manage the hotel. Generally, we may be limited in our ability to sell, lease or otherwise transfer hotels unless the transferee is not a competitor of the franchisor and the transferee agrees to assume the related franchise agreements. If the franchisor does not consent to the sale or financing of our hotels, we may be unable to consummate transactions that are in our best interests or the terms of those transactions may be less favorable to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the execution of our strategies. 
 Hotel re-development is subject to timing, budgeting and other risks that would increase our operating costs and limit our ability to make distributions to stockholders. 
 We intend to acquire hotel properties from time to time as suitable opportunities arise, taking into consideration general economic conditions, and seek to re-develop or reposition these hotels. Redevelopment of hotel properties involves a number of risks, including risks associated with: 
 construction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs; 

receipt of zoning, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations; 

development costs incurred for projects that are not pursued to completion; 

acts of God such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods or fires that could adversely impact a project; 

financing; and 

governmental restrictions on the nature or size of a project. 

We cannot assure you that any re-development project will be completed on time or within budget. Our inability to complete a project on time or within budget would increase our operating costs and reduce our net income. 
 The hotel business is capital intensive and our inability to obtain financing could limit our growth. 
 Our hotel properties will require periodic capital expenditures and renovation to remain competitive. Acquisitions or development of additional hotel properties will require significant capital expenditures. In addition, several of our mortgage lenders require that we set aside annual amounts for capital improvements to the secured property. We may not be able to fund capital improvements or acquisitions solely from cash provided from our operating activities because we must distribute at least 90.0 of our REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains, each year to maintain our REIT tax status. As a result, our ability to fund significant capital expenditures, acquisitions or hotel development through retained earnings is very limited. Consequently, we rely upon the availability of debt or equity capital to fund any significant investments or capital improvements. Our ability to grow through acquisitions or development of hotels will be limited if we cannot obtain satisfactory debt or equity financing which will depend on market conditions. Neither our charter nor our bylaws limit the amount of debt that we can incur. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing or that we will be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms. 
 Uninsured and underinsured losses could adversely affect our operating results and our ability to make distributions to the Company s stockholders. 
 We maintain comprehensive insurance on each of our hotel properties, including liability, fire and extended coverage, of the type and amount we believe are customarily obtained for or by hotel owners. There are no assurances that current coverage will continue to be available at reasonable rates. Various types of catastrophic losses, like hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, such as Hurricane Ian in September 2022, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in August and September 2017, respectively, Hurricane Matthew in October 2016 and Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, losses from foreign terrorist activities, such as those on September 11, 2001, losses from power outages or losses from domestic terrorist activities, such as the Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995, may not be insurable or may not be economically insurable. Currently, our insurers provide terrorism coverage in conjunction with the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program sponsored by the federal government through which insurers are able to receive compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism. 
 20 
 
 In the event of a substantial loss, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover the full current market value or replacement cost of our lost investment. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a hotel, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the hotel. In that event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors might also keep us from using insurance proceeds to replace or renovate a hotel after it has been damaged or destroyed. Under those circumstances, the insurance proceeds we receive might be inadequate to restore our economic position on the damaged or destroyed property. 
 Noncompliance with governmental regulations could adversely affect our operating results. 
 Environmental Matters 
 Our hotels may be subject to environmental liabilities. An owner of real property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property. We may face liability regardless of: 
 our knowledge of the contamination; 

the timing of the contamination; 

the cause of the contamination; or 

the party responsible for the contamination of the property. 

There may be unknown environmental problems associated with our properties. If environmental contamination exists on our properties, we could become subject to strict, joint and several liability for the contamination by virtue of our ownership interest. 
 The presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell the property and we may incur substantial remediation costs. The discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to comply with our covenants and to pay distributions to stockholders. 
 Americans with Disabilities Act and Other Changes in Governmental Rules and Regulations 
 Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ADA ), all public accommodations must meet various federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Compliance with the ADA s requirements could require removal of access barriers, and non-compliance could result in the U.S. government imposing fines or in private litigants winning damages. If we are required to make substantial modifications to our hotels, whether to comply with the ADA or other changes in governmental rules and regulations, our financial condition, results of operations and ability to comply with the terms of our loan covenants and to make distributions to the Company s stockholders could be adversely affected. 
 Our hotels may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities which could cause us to incur substantial costs. 
 The hotel properties that we acquire may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have no recourse, or only limited recourse, against the sellers. Contingent or unknown liabilities with respect to entities or properties acquired might include: 
 liabilities for environmental conditions; 

losses in excess of our insured coverage; 

accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; 

tax, legal and regulatory liabilities; 

claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with the Company s predecessors prior to our acquisition transactions that had not been asserted or were unknown prior to the Company s acquisition transactions; and 

claims for indemnification by the general partners, officers and directors and others indemnified by the former owners of our properties. 

In general, the representations and warranties provided under the transaction agreements related to the sales of the hotel properties may not survive the closing of the transactions. While we will likely seek to require the sellers to indemnify us with respect to breaches of representations and warranties that survive, such indemnification may be limited and subject to various materiality thresholds, a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses. As a result, there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts 
 21 
 
 with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties. In addition, the total amount of costs and expenses that may be incurred with respect to liabilities associated with these hotels may exceed our expectations, and we may experience other unanticipated adverse effects, all of which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to make distributions to the Company s stockholders. 
 Future terrorist activities may adversely affect, and create uncertainty in, our business. 
 Terrorism in the United States or elsewhere could have an adverse effect on our business, although the degree of impact will depend on a number of factors, including the U.S. and global economies and global financial markets. Previous terrorist attacks in the United States and subsequent terrorism alerts have adversely affected the travel and hospitality industries in the past. Such attacks, or the threat of such attacks, could have a material adverse effect on our business, our ability to finance our business, our ability to insure our properties and/or our results of operations and financial condition, as a whole. 
 We face risks related to pandemic diseases, including COVID-19 and its variants, which could materially and adversely affect travel and result in reduced demand for our hotels. 
 Our business could be materially and adversely affected by the effect of a pandemic disease on the travel industry. For example, the outbreaks of SARS and avian flu in 2003 had a severe impact on the travel industry, the outbreaks of H1N1 flu in 2009 threatened to have a similar impact, the perceived threat of a Zika virus outbreak in 2016 had an impact on the south Florida market, and the COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact on the travel industry. A prolonged recurrence of COVID-19, SARS, avian flu, H1N1 flu, Ebola virus, Zika virus or another pandemic disease also may result in health or other government authorities imposing restrictions on travel. Any of these events could result in a significant drop in demand for our hotels and adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations. 
 General Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry 
 Illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties and harm our financial condition. 
 Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more hotel properties in our portfolio in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions is limited. 
 The real estate market is affected by many factors that are beyond our control, including: 
 adverse changes in international, national, regional and local economic and market conditions; 

changes in interest rates and in the cost and terms of debt financing; 

absence of liquidity in credit markets which limits the availability and amount of debt financing; 

changes in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations, fiscal policies and ordinances; 

the ongoing need for capital improvements, particularly in older structures; 

changes in operating expenses; and 

civil unrest, acts of war or terrorism and the consequences of terrorist acts, acts of God, including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and other natural disasters, which may result in uninsured losses. 

We may decide to sell our hotels in the future. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any hotel property for the price or on the terms set by us, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a hotel property. 
 We may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a hotel property can be sold. We cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements. In acquiring a hotel property, we may agree to lock-out provisions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions, such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property. These factors and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, as well as our ability to comply with the terms of the indenture and to pay distributions to stockholders. 
 22 
 
 Future acquisitions may not yield the returns expected, may result in disruptions to our business, may strain management resources and may result in stockholder dilution. 
 Our business strategy may not ultimately be successful and may not provide positive returns on our investments. Acquisitions may cause disruptions in our operations and divert management s attention away from day-to-day operations. The issuance of equity securities in connection with any acquisition could be substantially dilutive to the Company s stockholders. 
 Our hotels may contain or develop harmful mold, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediating the problem. 
 When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing, as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property, which would reduce our cash available for distribution. In addition, the presence of significant mold could expose us to liability from our guests, employees or the management company and others if property damage or health concerns arise and could harm our reputation. 
 Increases in property taxes would increase our operating costs, reduce our income and adversely affect our ability to make distributions to the Company s stockholders. 
 Each of our hotel properties is subject to real and personal property taxes. These taxes may increase as tax rates change and as the properties are assessed or reassessed by taxing authorities. If property taxes increase, our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to make distributions to the Company s stockholders could be materially and adversely affected and the market price of the Company s shares could decline. 
 Risks Related to Our Debt 
 We have substantial financial leverage. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the principal balance of our mortgages, unsecured and secured debt was approximately 324.4 million, not accounting for reductions of unamortized premiums or deferred financing costs as shown on our balance sheet. Historically, we have incurred debt for acquisitions and to fund our renovation, redevelopment and rebranding programs. Limitations upon our access to additional debt could adversely affect our ability to fund these programs or acquire hotels in the future. 
 Our financial leverage could negatively affect our business and financial results, including the following: 
 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, future business opportunities, paying dividends or other purposes; 

limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, renovation, redevelopment and rebranding plans, acquisitions, debt service requirements and other purposes; 

adversely affect our ability to satisfy our financial obligations, including those related to our loan covenants; 

limit our ability to refinance existing debt; 

require us to agree to additional restrictions and limitations on our business operations and capital structure to obtain financing or to modify the terms of existing obligations; 

force us to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on unfavorable terms; 

increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, and to interest rate fluctuations; 

force us to issue additional equity, possibly on terms unfavorable to existing stockholders; 

limit our flexibility to make, or react to, changes in our business and our industry; and 

place us at a competitive disadvantage, compared to our competitors that have less debt. 

23 
 
 We must comply with financial covenants in our mortgage loan agreements. 
 Our mortgage loan agreements contain various financial covenants. Failure to comply with these financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in the local competitive environment, general economic conditions and disruption caused by renovation activity or major weather disturbances. 
 If we violate the financial covenants contained in our mortgage loan agreements, we may attempt to negotiate waivers of the violations or amend the terms of the applicable mortgage loan agreement with the lender; however, we can make no assurance that we would be successful in any such negotiation or that, if successful in obtaining waivers or amendments, such waivers or amendments would be on attractive terms. Some mortgage loan agreements provide alternate cure provisions which may allow us to otherwise comply with the financial covenants by obtaining an appraisal of the hotel, prepaying a portion of the outstanding indebtedness or by providing cash collateral until such time as the financial covenants are met by the collateralized property without consideration of the cash collateral. Alternate cure provisions which include prepaying a portion of the outstanding indebtedness or providing cash collateral may have a material impact on our liquidity. 
 If we are unable to negotiate a waiver or amendment or satisfy alternate cure provisions, if any, or unable to meet any alternate cure requirements and a default were to occur, we would possibly have to refinance the debt through debt financing, private or public offerings of debt securities, additional equity financing, or by disposing of an asset. We are uncertain whether we will be able to refinance these obligations or if refinancing terms will be favorable. 
 We have three mortgage debt obligations maturing in 2023 and 2024 and if we are not successful in extending the terms of this indebtedness or in refinancing this debt on acceptable economic terms or at all, our overall financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 
 We will be required to seek additional capital in the near future to refinance or replace existing long-term mortgage debt that is maturing. The ability to refinance or replace mortgage debt is subject to market conditions and could become limited in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain future financings on acceptable terms, if at all. In May 2023, the mortgage on our DoubleTree by Hilton Laurel matures. In October 2023, the mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport matures. In July 2024 the mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront matures. We also have additional significant obligations maturing in subsequent years. The total aggregate amount of our debt obligation scheduled to mature in 2023, inclusive of monthly principal and interest amortization of all our indebtedness, not including lease obligations, is approximately 70.1 million, which represents approximately 18.9 of our total debt obligation outstanding as of December 31, 2022. The total aggregate amount of our debt obligation scheduled to mature in 2024, inclusive of monthly principal amortization of all our mortgage indebtedness, is approximately 51.5 million, which represents approximately 13.9 of our total debt obligation outstanding as of December 31, 2022. The total aggregate amount of our debt obligation scheduled to mature in 2025, inclusive of monthly principal amortization of all our mortgage indebtedness, is approximately 125.0 million, which represents approximately 33.8 of our total debt obligation outstanding as of December 31, 2022. 
 We will need to, and plan to, renew, replace or extend our long-term indebtedness prior to the respective maturity date. If we are unable to extend our maturing loans, we may be required to repay the outstanding principal amount at maturity or a portion of such indebtedness upon refinance. If we do not have sufficient funds to repay any portion of the indebtedness, it may be necessary to raise capital through debt financing, private or public offerings of debt securities or equity financings. We are uncertain whether we will be able to refinance this obligation or if refinancing terms will be favorable. If, at the time of any refinancing, prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates on refinancing, increases in interest expense would lower our cash flow, and, consequently, cash available to meet our financial obligations. If we are unable to obtain alternative or additional financing arrangements in the future, or if we cannot obtain financing on acceptable terms, we may not be able to execute our business strategies or we may be forced to dispose of hotel properties on disadvantageous terms, potentially resulting in losses and potentially reducing cash flow from operating activities if the sale proceeds in excess of the amount required to satisfy the indebtedness could not be reinvested in equally profitable real property investments. Moreover, the terms of any additional financing may restrict our financial flexibility, including the debt we may incur in the future, or may restrict our ability to manage our business as we had intended. To the extent we cannot repay our outstanding debt, we risk losing some or all of our hotel properties to foreclosure and we could be required to invoke insolvency proceedings including, but not limited to, commencing a voluntary case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
 For tax purposes, a foreclosure of any of our hotels would be treated as a sale of the hotel for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage. If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the hotel, we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure, but we would not receive any cash proceeds, which could hinder Sotherly s ability to meet the REIT distribution requirements imposed by the Code. In addition, we have given full or partial guarantees to lenders of mortgage debt on behalf of the entities that own our hotels. When we give a guarantee on behalf of an entity that owns one of our hotels, we will be responsible to the lender for satisfaction of the debt if it is not paid by such entity. 
 24 
 
 Our borrowing costs are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. 
 Higher interest rates could increase our debt service requirements and interest expense. Currently, our floating rate debt is limited to the mortgages on the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport, the Hotel Alba Tampa, Tapestry Collection by Hilton and The Whitehall, in Houston, Texas. The mortgages on the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport and the Hotel Alba Tampa, Tapestry Collection by Hilton bear interest at rates tied to SOFR. The mortgage on The Whitehall, in Houston, Texas bears interest at a rate tied to the New York Prime Rate. Each mortgage provides for a substitute rate and minimum rates of interest. To the extent that increases in SOFR or New York Prime Rate, or a substitute rate of interest cause the interest on the mortgages to exceed the minimum rates of interest, we are exposed to rising interest rates. 
 Should we obtain new debt financing or refinance existing indebtedness, we may increase the amount of floating rate debt that currently exists. In addition, adverse economic conditions could also cause the terms on which we borrow to be unfavorable. 
 Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure 
 Our ability to effect a merger or other business combination transaction may be restricted by our Operating Partnership agreement. 
 In the event of a change of control of the Company, the limited partners of our Operating Partnership will have the right, for a period of 30 days following the change of control event, to cause the Operating Partnership to redeem all of the units held by the limited partners for a cash amount equal to the cash redemption amount otherwise payable upon redemption pursuant to the partnership agreement. This cash redemption right may make it more unlikely or difficult for a third party to propose or consummate a change of control transaction, even if such transaction were in the best interests of the Company s stockholders. 
 Provisions of the Company s charter may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of the Company. 
 Aggregate Share and Common Share Ownership Limits 
 The Company s charter provides that no person may directly or indirectly own more than 9.9 of the value of the Company s outstanding shares of capital stock or more than 9.9 of the number of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock. These ownership limitations may prevent an acquisition of control of the Company by a third party without the Company s board of directors approval, even if the Company s stockholders believe the change of control is in their best interest. The Company s board of directors has discretion to waive that ownership limit if, including other considerations, the board receives evidence that ownership in excess of the limit will not jeopardize the Company s REIT status. 
 Authority to Issue Stock 
 The Company s amended and restated charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 69,000,000 shares of common stock and up to 11,000,000 shares of preferred stock, to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. Issuances of additional shares of stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company, including transactions at a premium over the market price of the Company s stock, even if stockholders believe that a change of control is in their best interest. The Company will be able to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock without stockholder approval, unless stockholder approval is required by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which the Company s securities may be listed or traded. 
 Provisions of Maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of the Company. 
 Certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law MGCL may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of shares of the Company s common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of such shares, including: 
 business combination provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an interested stockholder (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10.0 or more of the voting power of our shares or an affiliate thereof) for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter imposes special appraisal rights and special stockholder voting requirements on these combinations; and 

control share provisions that provide that control shares of the Company (defined as shares which, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a control share acquisition (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of control shares have no voting rights except to the extent approved by the Company s stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares. 

25 
 
 The Company has opted out of these provisions of the MGCL, in the case of the business combination provisions of the MGCL by resolution of the Company s board of directors, and in the case of the control share provisions of the MGCL pursuant to a provision in the Company s bylaws. However, the Company s board of directors may by resolution elect to opt into the business combination provisions of the MGCL and the Company may, by amendment to its bylaws, opt into the control share provisions of the MGCL in the future. The Company s board of directors has the exclusive power to amend the Company s bylaws. 
 Additionally, Title 8, Subtitle 3 of the MGCL permits the Company s board of directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in the Company s charter or bylaws, to implement takeover defenses, some of which (for example, a classified board) the Company does not currently have. These provisions may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal for the Company or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company under the circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of the Company s common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price. 
 Provisions in the Company s executive employment agreements may make a change of control of the Company more costly or difficult. 
 The Company s employment agreements with Andrew M. Sims, our Chairman, David R. Folsom, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Anthony E. Domalski, our Secretary and Chief Financial Officer, Scott M. Kucinski, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Robert E. Kirkland IV, our General Counsel, and Andrew M. Sims Jr., our Vice President - Operations Investor Relations, contain provisions providing for substantial payments to these officers in the event of a change of control of the Company. Specifically, if the Company terminates these executives employment without cause or the executive resigns with good reason (which for Sims, Folsom, and Domalski, includes a failure to nominate Andrew M. Sims to the Company s board of directors or his involuntary removal from the Company s board of directors, unless for cause or by vote of the stockholders), or if there is a change of control, each of these executives is entitled to the following: 
 any accrued but unpaid salary and bonuses; 

vesting of any previously issued stock options and restricted stock; 

payment of the executive s life, health and disability insurance coverage for a period of five years following termination; 

any unreimbursed expenses; and 

a severance payment equal to three times for each executive s respective combined salary and actual bonus compensation for the preceding fiscal year. 

In the event that the Company elects not to renew Mr. Folsom s employment agreement, then Mr. Folsom is entitled to receive the following: (i) any accrued but unpaid salary and bonuses; (ii) a severance payment equal to Mr. Folsom s combined salary and actual bonus compensation for the preceding fiscal year, to be paid within five (5) days of Mr. Folsom s last day of employment; and (iii) payment of the full premium (including administrative fee) for continuing health insurance coverage under COBRA or any similar state law for a period of two (2) years following the expiration of Mr. Folsom s employment agreement. 
 In addition, these executives will receive additional payments to compensate them for the additional taxes, if any, imposed on them under Section 4999 of the Code by reason of receipt of excess parachute payments. We will not be able to deduct any of the above amounts paid to the executives for tax purposes. 
 These provisions may make a change of control of the Company, even if it is in the best interests of the Company s stockholders, more costly and difficult and may reduce the amounts the Company s stockholders would receive in a change of control transaction. 
 Our ownership limitations may restrict or prevent you from engaging in certain transfers of the Company s common stock or preferred stock. 
 In order to maintain the Company s REIT qualification, it cannot be closely held (i.e., more than 50.0 in value of our outstanding stock cannot be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals during the last half of any taxable year). To preserve the Company s REIT qualification, the Company s charter contains a 9.9 aggregate share ownership limit and a 9.9 common share ownership limit. Generally, any shares of the Company s stock owned by affiliated persons will be added together for purposes of the aggregate share ownership limit, and any shares of common stock owned by affiliated owners will be added together for purposes of the common share ownership limit. 
 If anyone transfers shares in a way that would violate the aggregate share ownership limit or the common share ownership limit, or prevent the Company from continuing to qualify as a REIT under the federal income tax laws, those shares instead will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and will be either redeemed by us or sold to a person whose ownership 
 26 
 
 of the shares will not violate the aggregate share ownership limit or the common share ownership limit. If this transfer to a trust fails to prevent such a violation or fails to preserve the Company s continued qualification as a REIT, then the Company will consider the initial intended transfer to be null and void from the outset. The intended transferee of those shares will be deemed never to have owned the shares. Anyone who acquires shares in violation of the aggregate share ownership limit, the common share ownership limit or the other restrictions on transfer in the Company s charter bears the risk of suffering a financial loss when the shares are redeemed or sold if the market price of the Company s stock falls between the date of purchase and the date of redemption or sale. 
 The Company s articles supplementary establishing and fixing the rights and preferences of each of our 8.0 Series B Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the Series B Preferred Stock ), 7.875 Series C Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the Series C Preferred Stock ), and 8.25 Series D Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the Series D Preferred Stock , and together with the Series B Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock, the Preferred Stock ), provide that no person may directly or indirectly own more than 9.9 of the aggregate number of outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, or Series D Preferred Stock, respectively, excluding any outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, or Series D Preferred Stock not treated as outstanding for federal income tax purposes. The Company s board of directors has discretion to waive that ownership limit if, including other considerations, the board receives evidence that ownership in excess of the limit will not jeopardize the Company s REIT status. 
 Holders of our outstanding preferred shares have dividend, liquidation and other rights that are senior to the rights of the holders of our common shares. 
 Our board of directors has the authority to designate and issue preferred shares with liquidation, dividend and other rights that are senior to those of our common shares. As of December 31, 2022, 1,464,100 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding, 1,346,110 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding, and 1,163,100 shares of our Series D Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding. The aggregate liquidation preference with respect to the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock is approximately 44.7 million, and annual dividends on our outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock are approximately 2.9 million. The aggregate liquidation preference with respect to the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock is approximately 40.9 million, and annual dividends on our outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock are approximately 2.7 million. The aggregate liquidation preference with respect to the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock is approximately 35.7 million, and annual dividends on our outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock are approximately 2.4 million. Holders of our Preferred Stock are entitled to cumulative dividends before any dividends may be declared or set aside on our common shares. Upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, before any payment is made to holders of our common shares, holders of these preferred shares are entitled to receive a liquidation preference of 25.00 per share plus any accrued and unpaid distributions. This will reduce the remaining amount of our assets, if any, available to distribute to holders of our common shares. In addition, holders of the Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, and Series D Preferred Stock voting together as a separate class have the right to elect two additional directors to our board of directors whenever dividends on the preferred shares are in arrears in an aggregate amount equivalent to six or more quarterly dividends (whether or not consecutive). As of December 31, 2022, distributions on our Preferred Stock are in arrears for the last twelve quarterly payments. Therefore, the holders of our Preferred Stock are entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional directors of the Company, at a special meeting or at the next annual meeting of stockholders and at each subsequent annual meeting of the stockholders until full cumulative distributions for all past unpaid periods are paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof in cash is set aside. No dividends may be paid on our common stock until such time as the Preferred Stock distributions are made current. 
 Because our decision to issue securities will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any future preferred offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future securities issuances reducing the market price of our common shares and diluting their interest. 
 The change of control conversion and redemption features of the Company s preferred stock may make it more difficult for a party to take over our Company or discourage a party from taking over our Company. 
 Upon a change of control (as defined in our charter), holders of our Preferred Stock will have the right (unless, as provided in our charter, we have provided or provide notice of our election to exercise our special optional redemption right before the relevant date) to convert some or all of their shares of preferred stock into shares of our common stock (or equivalent value of alternative consideration). Upon such a conversion, holders will be limited to a maximum number of shares equal to the share cap, subject to adjustments. If the common stock price is less than 3.015, subject to adjustment, holders will receive a maximum of 8.29187 shares of our common stock per share of Series B Preferred Stock, which may result in a holder receiving value that is less than the liquidation preference of the Series B Preferred Stock. If the common stock price is less than 2.94, subject to adjustment, holders will receive a maximum of 8.50340 shares of our common stock per share of Series C Preferred Stock, which may result in a holder receiving value that is less than the liquidation preference of the Series C Preferred Stock. If the common stock price is less than 3.38, subject to adjustment, holders will receive a maximum of 7.39645 shares of our common stock per share of Series D Preferred Stock, which may result in a holder receiving value that is less than the liquidation preference of the Series D Preferred Stock. In 
 27 
 
 addition, those features of our Preferred Stock may have the effect of inhibiting or discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for our Company or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of shares of our common stock and shares of our Preferred Stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price or that stockholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests. 
 Our organizational documents have no limitation on the amount of indebtedness we may incur. As a result, we may become highly leveraged in the future, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Our business strategy contemplates the use of both secured and unsecured debt to finance long-term growth. In addition, our organizational documents contain no limitations on the amount of debt that we may incur, and the Company s board of directors may change our financing policy at any time. As a result, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt, including secured debt, in the future. Incurring debt could subject us to many risks, including the risks that: 
 our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest; 

our debt may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; 

we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing cash available for funds available for operations and capital expenditures, future business opportunities or other purposes; and 

the terms of any refinancing may not be in the same amount or on terms as favorable as the terms of the existing debt being refinanced. 

The board of directors revocation of the Company s REIT status without stockholder approval may decrease the Company s stockholders total return. 
 The Company s charter provides that the Company s board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate the Company s REIT election, without the approval of the Company s stockholders, if the Company s board of directors determines that it is no longer in the Company s best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT. If the Company ceases to be a REIT, it would become subject to federal income tax on its taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of its taxable income to the Company s stockholders, which may have adverse consequences on our total return to the Company s stockholders. 
 The ability of the Company s board of directors to change the Company s major corporate policies may not be in your best interest. 
 The Company s board of directors determines the Company s major corporate policies, including its acquisition, financing, growth, operations and distribution policies. The Company s board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies from time to time without the vote or consent of the Company s stockholders. 
 Our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed. 
 We depend on the efforts and expertise of our Chairman, Andrew M. Sims; our President and Chief Executive Officer, David R. Folsom; our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Scott M. Kucinski; and our Secretary and Chief Financial Officer, Anthony E. Domalski, to manage our day-to-day operations and strategic business direction. The loss of any of their services could have an adverse effect on our operations. 
 Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest of Our Officers and Directors 
 Conflicts of interest could result in our executive officers and certain of our directors acting in a manner other than in the Company s stockholders best interest. 
 Conflicts of interest relating to Our Town, the entity that manages our ten wholly-owned hotels and our two condominium hotel rental programs, and the terms of our management agreements with Our Town may lead to management decisions that are not in the stockholders best interest. 
 Conflicts of interest relating to Our Town may lead to management decisions that are not in the stockholders best interest. an affiliate of Andrew M. Sims, our Chairman, an affiliate of David R. Folsom, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Andrew M. Sims Jr., our Vice President - Operations Investor Relations, together own an interest of approximately 85.0 , as of March 15, 2023, in Our Town. Mr. Sims, Mr. Folsom, and Mr. Sims Jr. serve as directors of Our Town. 
 28 
 
 Our management agreements with Our Town establish the terms of Our Town s management of our hotels covered by those agreements. The OTH Master Agreement provides that in the event the agreement is terminated in connection with the sale of a hotel, and Our Town accepts an offer to manage another hotel which is reasonably comparable to the hotel that was sold, we will not be liable for any termination fee. If we do not offer Our Town such opportunity or Our Town declines such opportunity, then a termination fee equivalent to the lesser of the management fees paid for the prior twelve-month period or the management fees for the period prior to the sale that is equal to the number of months remaining under the term of the agreement will be due. If we terminate a hotel management agreement at the end of any renewable five-year term, Our Town is due a termination fee equivalent to one month s management fees, as determined under the agreement. 
 As owners of Our Town, which would receive any management and management termination fees payable by us under the management agreements, Mr. Sims or Mr. Folsom may influence our decisions to sell a hotel or acquire or develop a hotel when it is not in the best interests of the Company s stockholders to do so. In addition, Mr. Sims and Mr. Folsom will have conflicts of interest with respect to decisions to enforce provisions of the management agreements, including any termination thereof. 
 Mr. Sims and Mr. Folsom approve the budgets upon which the incentive management fee payable to Our Town is based. As owners of Our Town, which would receive any incentive management fees payable by us under the management agreements, Mr. Sims or Mr. Folsom may influence the budget process, including the revenue targets set for each hotel. The incentive management fees are based on each hotel exceeding budgeted revenue targets. 
 We purchase employee medical benefits through Our Town (or its affiliate) for those employees employed by Our Town who work exclusively for our properties. Mr. Sims and Mr. Folsom participate in the budget approval process confirming employee insurance rates paid to Our Town. Our Town's policy is to rebate 70 of any annual surplus in its self-insured health plan back to the Company and retain the remaining 30 . As owners of Our Town, which would receive 30 of any such surplus, Mr. Sims or Mr. Folsom may influence the budget process. 
 There can be no assurance that provisions in our bylaws will always be successful in mitigating conflicts of interest. 
 Under our bylaws, a committee consisting of only independent directors must approve any transaction between us and Our Town, or any interested director. However, there can be no assurance that these policies always will be successful in mitigating such conflicts, and decisions could be made that might not fully reflect the interests of all of the Company s stockholders. 
 Certain of our officers and directors control trusts that hold units in our Operating Partnership and may seek to avoid adverse tax consequences, which could result from transactions that would otherwise benefit the Company s stockholders. 
 Holders of units in our Operating Partnership, including trusts controlled in whole or part by members of our management team, may suffer adverse tax consequences upon our sale or refinancing of certain properties. Therefore, holders of units, including a trust controlled in part by Andrew M. Sims, and a charitable trust controlled by Edward S. Stein, may have different objectives than holders of the Company s stock regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of a property s sale, or the timing and amount of a property s refinancing. As of December 31, 2022, these trusts owned approximately 2.3 of the outstanding units in our Operating Partnership. The individuals controlling these trusts may influence us not to sell or refinance certain properties, even if such sale or refinancing might be financially advantageous to the Company s stockholders, or may influence us to enter into tax-deferred exchanges with the proceeds of such sales when such a reinvestment might not otherwise be in our best interest. 
 Federal Income Tax Risks Related to the Company s Status as a REIT 
 The federal income tax laws governing REITs are complex. 
 The Company intends to operate in a manner that will maintain its qualification as a REIT under the federal income tax laws. The REIT qualification requirements are extremely complex, however, and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification as a REIT are limited. The Company has not requested or obtained a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service IRS that it qualifies as a REIT. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that the Company will be successful in operating in a manner that will permit it to qualify as a REIT. At any time, new laws, interpretations or court decisions may change the federal tax laws or the federal income tax consequences of the Company s qualification as a REIT. We cannot predict when or if any new federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective and any such law, regulation or interpretation may take effect retroactively. The Company and its stockholders could be adversely affected by any such change in, or any new, federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation. We are not aware, however, of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect the Company s ability to qualify as a REIT. 
 29 
 
 Failure to make distributions could subject the Company to tax. 
 In order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, each year the Company must pay out to its stockholders in distributions, as qualifying distributions, at least 90.0 of its REIT taxable income, computed without regard to the deductions for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains and reduced by certain noncash items. To the extent that the Company satisfies this distribution requirement, but distributes less than 100.0 of its taxable income (including its net capital gain), it will be subject to federal corporate income tax on its undistributed taxable income. In addition, the Company will be subject to a 4.0 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that it pays out to its stockholders as a qualifying distribution for a calendar year is less than the sum of: (A) 85.0 of our ordinary income for such calendar year, plus (B) 95.0 of our capital gain net income for such calendar year. The Company s only recurring source of funds to make these distributions comes from rent received from its TRS Lessees whose only recurring source of funds with which to make these payments and distributions is the net cash flow (after payment of operating and other costs and expenses and management fees) from hotel operations, and any dividend and other distributions that we may receive from MHI Holding. Accordingly, the Company may be required to borrow money or sell assets to make distributions sufficient to enable it to pay out enough of its taxable income to satisfy the distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4.0 nondeductible excise tax in a particular year. 
 Failure to qualify as a REIT would subject the Company to federal income tax. 
 If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be required to pay federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates. The resulting tax liability might cause the Company to borrow funds, liquidate some of its investments or take other steps that could negatively affect its operating results in order to pay any such tax. Unless it is entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, the Company would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which it lost its qualification. If the Company lost its REIT status, its net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved. In addition, the Company would no longer be required to make distributions to its stockholders, and it would not be able to deduct any stockholder distributions in computing its taxable income. This would substantially reduce the Company s earnings, cash available to pay distributions, and the value of common stock. 
 Failure to qualify as a REIT may cause the Company to reduce or eliminate distributions to its stockholders, and the Company may face increased difficulty in raising capital or obtaining financing. 
 If the Company fails to remain qualified as a REIT, it may have to reduce or eliminate any distributions to its stockholders in order to satisfy its income tax liabilities. Any distributions that the Company does make to its stockholders would be treated as taxable dividends to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits. This may result in negative investor and market perception regarding the market value of the Company s stock, and the value of its stock may be reduced. In addition, the Company and the Operating Partnership may face increased difficulty in raising capital or obtaining financing if the Company fails to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT because of the resulting tax liability and potential reduction of its market valuation. 
 If MHI Holding exceeds certain value thresholds, this could cause the Company to fail to qualify as a REIT. 
 A REIT may own up to 100 of the stock of one or more TRSs. A TRS may hold assets and earn income that would not be qualifying assets or income if held or earned directly by a REIT. Overall, no more than 20.0 of the value of a REIT s assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRSs. MHI Holding is a TRS and the Company may form other TRSs in the future. The Company plans to monitor the value of its shares of MHI Holding and of any other TRS the Company may form. However, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not attempt to attribute additional value to the shares of MHI Holding or to the shares of any other TRS that the Company may form. If the Company is treated as owning securities of one or more TRSs with an aggregate value that is in excess of the thresholds outlined above, the Company could lose its status as a REIT or become subject to penalties. 
 Even if the Company remains qualified as a REIT, it may face other tax liabilities that reduce its cash flow. 
 Even if the Company remains qualified for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on its income and assets. For example: 
 it will be required to pay tax on undistributed REIT taxable income (including net capital gain); 

if it has net income from the disposition of foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or other non-qualifying income from foreclosure property, it must pay tax on that income at the highest corporate rate; 

if it (or the Operating Partnership or any subsidiary of the Operating Partnership other than MHI Holding) sells a property in a prohibited transaction, its gain, or its share of such gain, from the sale would be subject to a 100.0 penalty tax. A 

30 
 
 prohibited transaction would be a sale of property, other than a foreclosure property, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business; 

MHI Holding is a fully taxable corporation and is required to pay federal and state taxes on its taxable income; and 

it may experience increases in its state and/or local income tax burdens as states and localities continue to look to modify their tax laws in order to raise revenues, including by (among other things) changing from a net taxable income-based regime to a gross receipts-based regime, suspending and/or limiting the use of net operating losses, increasing tax rates and fees, imposing surcharges and subjecting partnerships to an entity-level tax, and limiting or disallowing certain U.S. federal deductions such as the dividends-paid deduction. 

Complying with REIT requirements may cause the Company to forgo attractive opportunities that could otherwise generate strong risk-adjusted returns and instead pursue less attractive opportunities, or none at all. 
 To qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of its income, the nature and diversification of its assets, the amounts it distributes to its stockholders and the ownership of its stock. 
 In general, when applying these tests, the Company is treated as owning its proportionate share of the Operating Partnership s assets (which share is determined in accordance with the Company s capital interest in the Operating Partnership) and as being entitled to the Operating Partnership s income attributable to such share. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of generating strong risk-adjusted returns on invested capital for our stockholders. 
 Complying with REIT requirements may force the Company to liquidate otherwise attractive investments, which could result in an overall loss on its investments. 
 To maintain qualification as a REIT, the Company must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75.0 of the value of its assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets. The remainder of the Company s assets (other than securities of one or more TRSs) generally cannot include more than 10.0 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10.0 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. In addition, in general, no more than 5.0 of the value of the Company s assets (other than government securities, qualified real estate assets and securities of one or more TRSs) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 20.0 of the value of the Company s total assets can be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. 
 When applying these asset tests, the Company is treated as owning its proportionate share of the Operating Partnership s assets (which is determined in accordance with the Company s capital interest in the Operating Partnership). If the Company fails to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, it must correct such failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter to avoid losing its REIT status and suffering adverse tax consequences. If the Company fails to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, and the failure exceeds a de-minimis threshold, the Company may be able to preserve its REIT status if the failure was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect. In this case, we will be required to dispose of the assets causing the failure within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure occurred, and we will be required to pay an additional tax of the greater of 50,000 or the product of the highest applicable tax rate multiplied by the net income generated on those assets. 
 As a result, we may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments. 
 If the Operating Partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, the Company could cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences. 
 We believe that the Operating Partnership will continue to qualify to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including the Company, will be required to pay tax on its allocable share of the Operating Partnership s income. We cannot assure you, however, that the IRS will not challenge the Operating Partnership s status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the Operating Partnership as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, the Company could fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs and, accordingly, cease to qualify as a REIT. Also, the failure of the Operating Partnership to qualify as a partnership would cause the Operating Partnership to become subject to federal and state corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners, including the Company. 
 31 
 
 The Company s failure to qualify as a REIT would have serious adverse consequences to its stockholders. 
 The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2004. The Company believes it has operated so as to qualify as a REIT under the Code and believes that its current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Code to enable the Company to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, it is possible that the Company has been organized or has operated in a manner that would not allow it to qualify as a REIT, or that its future operations could cause it to fail to qualify. Qualification as a REIT requires the Company to satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex sections of the Code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within its control. For example, in order to qualify as a REIT, the Company must satisfy a 75.0 gross income test pursuant to Code Section 856(c)(3) and a 95.0 gross income test pursuant to Code Section 856(c)(2) each taxable year. In addition, the Company must pay dividends, as qualifying distributions, to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90.0 of its REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and by excluding capital gains and also reduced by certain noncash items) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. While historically the Company has satisfied the distribution requirement discussed above, by making cash distributions to its stockholders, the Company may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, its stock. The provisions of the Code and applicable Treasury regulations regarding qualification as a REIT are more complicated in the Company s case because it holds its assets through the Operating Partnership. 
 If MHI Holding does not qualify as a TRS, or if the Company s hotel manager does not qualify as an eligible independent contractor, the Company would fail to qualify as a REIT and would be subject to higher taxes and have less cash available for distribution to its stockholders. 
 Rent paid by a lessee that is a related party tenant of ours will not be qualifying income for purposes of the two gross income tests applicable to REITs, as noted above. The Company currently leases substantially all of its hotels to the TRS Lessees, which are disregarded entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes and are wholly-owned by MHI Holding, a TRS, and expects to continue to do so. So long as MHI Holding qualifies as a TRS, it will not be treated as a related party tenant with respect to the Company s properties that are managed by an independent hotel management company that qualifies as an eligible independent contractor. The Company believes that MHI Holding will continue to qualify to be treated as a TRS for federal income tax purposes, but there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge this status or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in such challenge, it is possible that the Company would fail to meet the asset tests applicable to REITs and substantially all of its income would fail to be qualifying income for purposes of the two gross income tests. If the Company failed to meet any of the asset or gross income tests, it would likely lose its REIT qualification for federal income tax purposes. 
 Additionally, if the Company s hotel manager does not qualify as an eligible independent contractor, the Company would fail to qualify as a REIT. Each hotel manager that enters into a management contract with the TRS Lessees must qualify as an eligible independent contractor under the REIT rules in order for the rent paid by the TRS Lessees to be qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. Among other requirements, in order to qualify as an eligible independent contractor, a hotel manager must not own, directly or through its stockholders, more than 35.0 of the Company s outstanding shares, taking into account certain ownership attribution rules. The ownership attribution rules that apply for purposes of these 35.0 thresholds are complex. Although the Company intends to monitor ownership of its shares by its hotel manager and its owners, there can be no assurance that these ownership levels will not be exceeded. 
 In addition, for the Company s hotel management company to qualify as an eligible independent contractor, such company or a related person must be actively engaged in the trade or business of operating qualified lodging facilities (as defined below) for one or more persons not related to the REIT or its TRSs at each time that such company enters into a hotel management contract with a TRS. The Company believes the hotel manager operates qualified lodging facilities for certain persons who are not related to the REIT or its TRSs. However, no assurances can be provided that this will continue to be the case or that any other hotel management companies that the Company may engage in the future will in fact comply with this requirement in the future. Failure to comply with this requirement would require the Company to find other managers for future contracts, and, if the Company hired a management company without knowledge of the failure, it could jeopardize the Company s status as a REIT. 
 As noted above, each hotel with respect to which a TRS Lessee pays rent must be a qualified lodging facility . A qualified lodging facility is a hotel, motel, or other establishment more than one-half of the dwelling units in which are used on a transient basis, including customary amenities and facilities, provided that no wagering activities are conducted at or in connection with such facility by any person who is engaged in the business of accepting wagers and who is legally authorized to engage in such business at or in connection with such facility. The Company believes that all of the hotels leased to the TRS Lessees are qualified lodging facilities. Although the Company intends to monitor future acquisitions and improvements of hotels, the REIT provisions of the Code provide only limited guidance for making determinations under the requirements for qualified lodging facilities, and there can be no assurance that these requirements will be satisfied in all cases.

 Foreign investors may be subject to U.S. tax on the disposition of the Company s stock if the Company does not qualify as a domestically controlled REIT. 
 A foreign person disposing of a U.S. real property interest, which includes stock of a U.S. corporation whose assets consist principally of U.S. real property interests, is generally subject to U.S. federal income tax under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 FIRPTA on the gain recognized on the disposition, unless such foreign person is a qualified foreign pension fund or one of the certain publicly traded non-U.S. qualified collective investment vehicles . Additionally, the transferee will be required to withhold 15.0 on the amount realized on the disposition if the foreign transferor is subject to U.S. federal income tax under FIRPTA. This 15.0 is creditable against the U.S. federal income tax liability of the foreign transferor in connection with such transferor s disposition of the Company s stock. FIRPTA does not apply, however, to the disposition of stock in a REIT if the REIT is domestically controlled (i.e., less than 50.0 of the REIT s capital stock, by value, has been owned directly or indirectly by persons who are not qualifying U.S. persons during a continuous five-year period ending on the date of disposition or, if shorter, during the entire period of the REIT s existence). On December 29, 2022, the IRS released proposed regulations under FIRPTA that, if finalized as proposed, include a new look-through rule in determining whether a REIT is considered to be domestically controlled. In determining ownership, the look-through rule would require a REIT to look-through any nonpublic domestic corporation if 25 or more of the corporation s stock (by value) is owned by foreign persons. We cannot be sure that the Company will qualify as a domestically controlled REIT. If the Company does not so qualify, gain realized by foreign investors on a sale of the Company s stock would be subject to U.S. income and withholding tax under FIRPTA, unless the Company s stock were traded on an established securities market and a foreign investor did not at any time during a specified testing period directly or indirectly own more than 10.0 of the value of the Company s outstanding stock. 
 If the leases between the Operating Partnership and the TRS Lessees are recharacterized, the Company may fail to qualify as a REIT. 
 To qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company must satisfy two gross income tests, under which specified percentages of the Company s gross income must be derived from certain sources, including rents from real property . Rents paid by the TRS Lessees to the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries pursuant to the leases of the Company s hotel properties will constitute substantially all of the Company s gross income. In order for such rent to qualify as rents from real property for purposes of the gross income tests, the leases must be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes and not be treated as service contracts, joint ventures, or some other type of arrangement. If the leases between the TRS Lessees to the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries are not respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes, the Company could fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. 
 MHI Holding increases our overall tax liability. 
 Our TRS Lessees are single-member limited liability companies that are wholly-owned, directly or indirectly, by MHI Holding, a TRS that is wholly-owned by the Operating Partnership. Each of our TRS Lessees is disregarded as an entity separate from MHI Holding for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such that the assets, liabilities, income, gains, losses, credits and deductions of our TRS Lessees are treated as the assets, liabilities, income, gains, losses, credits and deductions of MHI Holding for U.S. federal income tax purposes. MHI Holding is subject to federal and state income tax on its taxable income, which will consist of the revenues from the hotels leased by the Company s TRS Lessees, net of the operating expenses for such hotels and rent payments. Accordingly, although the Company s ownership of MHI Holding and the TRS Lessees will allow it to participate in the operating income from its hotels in addition to receiving rent, that operating income will be fully subject to income tax. The after-tax net income of MHI Holding, if any, will be available for distribution to the Company via the Operating Partnership. 
 The Company will incur a 100.0 excise tax on its transactions with MHI Holding and the TRS Lessees that are not conducted on an arm s-length basis. For example, to the extent that the rent paid by the TRS Lessees exceeds an arm s-length rental amount, such amount potentially will be subject to this excise tax. The Company intends that all transactions among itself, MHI Holding and the TRS Lessees will be conducted on an arm s-length basis and, therefore, that the rent paid by the TRS Lessees will not be subject to this excise tax. While the Company believes its leases have customary terms and reflect normal business practices and that the rents paid thereto reflect market terms, there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree. 
 Taxation of dividend income could make the Company s stock less attractive to certain investors and reduce the market price of its stock. 
 The federal income tax laws governing REITs, or the administrative interpretations of those laws, may be amended at any time. Any new laws or interpretations may take effect retroactively and could adversely affect the Company or could adversely affect its stockholders. Currently, qualified dividends, which include dividends from domestic C corporations that are paid to non-corporate stockholders, are subject to a reduced maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 20.0 , plus a 3.8 Medicare tax discussed below. Because REITs generally do not pay corporate-level taxes as a result of the dividends-paid deduction to which they are entitled, 
 33 
 
 dividends from REITs generally are not treated as qualified dividends and thus do not qualify for a reduced tax rate. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA ), for taxable years prior to January 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer may deduct 20 of ordinary REIT dividends that are not capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income resulting in an effective maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 29.6 (based on the current maximum U.S. federal income tax rate for individuals of 37 ). Individuals, trusts and estates whose income exceeds certain thresholds are also subject to a 3.8 Medicare tax on dividends received from the Company. The more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are taxed at individual rates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the Company s stock. Moreover, there is no assurance that we will always distribute ordinary income dividends, or that Congress will not repeal such legislation. 
 Investors may be subject to a 3.8 Medicare tax in connection with an investment in the Company s stock. 
 The U.S. tax laws impose a 3.8 Medicare tax on the net investment income (i.e., interest, dividends, capital gains, annuities, and rents that are not derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business) of individuals with income exceeding 200,000 250,000 if married filing jointly or 125,000 if married filing separately), and of estates and trusts. Dividends on the Company s stock as well as gains from the disposition of the Company s stock may be subject to the Medicare tax. Prospective investors should consult with their independent advisors as to the applicability of the Medicare tax to an investment in the Company s stock in light of such investors particular circumstances. 
 Investors may be subject to U.S. withholding tax under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. 
 On March 18, 2010, the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act (the HIRE Act was enacted in the United States. The HIRE Act includes provisions known as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act FATCA ), that generally impose a 30.0 U.S. withholding tax on withholdable payments, which consist of (i) U.S.-source dividends, interest, rents and other fixed or determinable annual or periodical income paid after June 30, 2014 and (ii) certain U.S.-source gross proceeds paid after December 31, 2018 to (a) foreign financial institutions unless (x) they enter into an agreement with the IRS to collect and disclose to the IRS information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners or (y) they comply with the terms of any FATCA intergovernmental agreement executed between the authorities in their jurisdiction and the U.S., and (b) non-financial foreign entities (i.e., foreign entities that are not foreign financial institutions) unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. Final regulations under FATCA were issued by the IRS on January 17, 2013 and have been subsequently supplemented by additional regulations and guidance. FATCA does not replace the existing U.S. withholding tax regime. However, the FATCA regulations contain coordination provisions to avoid double withholding on U.S.-source income. 
 A foreign investor that receives dividends on the Company s stock or gross proceeds from a disposition of shares of the Company s stock may be subject to FATCA withholding tax with respect to such dividends or gross proceeds. 
 Foreign investors will be subject to U.S. withholding tax on the receipt of ordinary dividends on the Company s stock. 
 The portion of dividends received by a foreign investor payable out of the Company s current and accumulated earnings and profits which are not attributable to capital gains and which are not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the foreign investor will generally be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a statutory rate of 30.0 . This 30.0 withholding tax may be reduced by an applicable income tax treaty. The FATCA and nonresident withholding regulations are complex. Even if the 30.0 withholding is reduced or eliminated by treaty for payments made to a foreign investor, FATCA withholding of 30.0 could apply depending upon the foreign investor s FATCA status. Foreign investors should consult with their independent advisors as to the U.S. withholding tax consequences to such investors with respect to their investment in the Company s stock in light of their particular circumstances, as well as determining the appropriate documentation required to reduce or eliminate U.S. withholding tax. 
 Foreign investors will be subject to U.S. income tax on the receipt of capital gain dividends on the Company s stock. 
 Under FIRPTA, distributions that we make to a foreign investor that are attributable to gains from our dispositions of U.S. real property interests capital gain dividends will be treated as income that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, and therefore subject to U.S. federal income tax, in the hands of the foreign investor, unless such foreign person is a qualified foreign pension fund or one of certain publicly traded non-U.S. qualified collective investment vehicles . A foreign investor who is subject to tax under FIRPTA will be subject to U.S. federal income tax (at the rates applicable to U.S. investors) on any capital gain dividends and will also be required to file U.S. federal income tax returns to report such capital gain dividends. Furthermore, capital gain dividends are subject to an additional 30.0 branch profits tax (which may be reduced by an applicable income tax treaty) in the hands of a foreign investor who is subject to tax under FIRPTA if such foreign investor is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 34 
 
 U.S. tax reform and related regulatory action could adversely affect you and the Company. 
 Because our operations are governed to a significant extent by the federal tax laws, new legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect investors in Company stock. The TCJA and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act CARES Act made significant changes to the U.S. federal tax system. Specifically, and as relevant to the Company and its subsidiaries, the TCJA reduced the maximum corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 , allows for full expensing of certain property, revised the net operating loss NOL provisions, set limitations on certain types of interest deductions, and expanded limitations on deductions for executive compensation. The TCJA also temporarily reduced individual federal income tax rates on ordinary income (the highest individual federal income tax rate has been reduced from 39.6 to 37 for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026). 
 At any time, the federal income tax laws governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended. We cannot predict when or if any new federal income tax law, regulation, or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective and any such law, regulation, or interpretation may take effect retroactively. Several recent proposals have been made that would make substantial changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws generally. We cannot predict whether any of these proposed changes will become law, or the long-term effect of any future law changes on the Company and its stockholders. We and our stockholders could be adversely affected by any such change in, or any new, federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation.

 Sotherly Hotels Inc. and Sotherly Hotels LP 
 Dividend and Distribution Information 
 The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2004. To maintain qualification as a REIT, we are required to make annual distributions to the Company s stockholders of at least 90.0 of our REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gain, which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our ability to pay distributions to the Company s stockholders will depend, in part, upon our receipt of distributions from our Operating Partnership which may depend upon receipt of lease payments with respect to our properties from 
 37 
 
 our TRS Lessees, and in turn, upon the management of our properties by our hotel manager. Distributions to the Company s stockholders will generally be taxable to the Company s stockholders as ordinary income; however, because a portion of our investments are equity ownership interests in hotels, which will result in depreciation and noncash charges against our income, a portion of our distributions may constitute a tax-free return of capital. To the extent not inconsistent with maintaining our REIT status, our TRS Lessees may retain any after-tax earnings. 
 As a result of the impact of COVID-19 on our business, our board of directors has suspended our common stock dividend. We anticipate that our board of directors will re-evaluate our current dividend policy on an ongoing basis. Distributions on our preferred stock are in arrears for the last twelve quarterly payments. On January 24, 2023, the Company announced it will resume quarterly distributions to holders of its preferred stock and set a record date of February 28, 2023 and a payment date of March 15, 2023, for the preferred distributions declared in January 2020. No dividends may be paid on our common stock until such time as the preferred stock distributions are made current. We did not pay any common dividends in 2021 or 2022. 
 In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must make distributions to our stockholders each year in an amount equal to at least: 
 90 of our REIT taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains plus 

90 of the excess of our net income from foreclosure property over the tax imposed on such income by the Code minus 

Any excess noncash income (as defined in the Code). 

During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not pay any common or preferred stock or unit distributions. 
 The amount of future common stock distributions will be based upon quarterly operating results, general economic conditions, requirements for capital improvements, the availability of debt and equity capital, the Code s annual distribution requirements, and other factors, which the Company s board of directors deems relevant. The amount, timing and frequency of distributions will be authorized by the Company s board of directors and declared by us based upon a variety of factors deemed relevant by our directors, and no assurance can be given that our distribution policy will not change in the future.

 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Overview 
 The Company is a self-managed and self-administered lodging REIT incorporated in Maryland in August 2004 to pursue opportunities in the full-service, primarily upscale and upper-upscale segments of the hotel industry located in primary and secondary markets in the mid-Atlantic and southern United States. Since January 1, 2020, we have completed the following acquisitions and dispositions: 
 On February 10, 2022, we sold the Sheraton Louisville Riverside hotel located in Jeffersonville, Indiana. 

On June 10, 2022, we sold the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh-Brownstone University hotel located in Raleigh, North Carolina 

As of December 31, 2022, our hotel portfolio consisted of ten full-service, primarily upscale and upper-upscale hotels with an aggregate total of 2,786 rooms, as well as interests in two condominium hotels and their associated rental programs. Seven of our hotels operate under well-known brands such as DoubleTree and Hyatt, and three are independent hotels. As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio consisted of the following hotel properties:

We conduct substantially all our business through the Operating Partnership, Sotherly Hotels LP. The Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and currently owns an approximate 95.8 interest in the Operating Partnership, with the remaining interest being held by limited partners who were contributors of our initial hotel properties and related assets. 
 To qualify as a REIT, neither the Company nor the Operating Partnership can operate our hotels. Therefore, our wholly-owned hotel properties are leased to our TRS Lessees that are wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, which then engage hotel management companies to operate the hotels under a management agreement. Our TRS Lessees have engaged Our Town to manage our hotels. Our TRS Lessees, and their parent, MHI Holding (MHI Hospitality TRS Holding, Inc.), are consolidated into each of our financial statements for accounting purposes. The earnings of MHI Holding are taxable as regular C corporations and are subject to federal, state, local, and, if applicable, foreign taxation on its taxable income.

 Key Operating Metrics 
 In the hotel industry, room revenue is considered the most important category of revenue and drives other revenue categories such as food, beverage, catering, parking and telephone. There are three key performance indicators used in the hotel industry to measure room revenues: 
 Occupancy, or the number of rooms sold, usually expressed as a percentage of total rooms available; 

Average daily rate, or ADR, which is total room revenue divided by the number of rooms sold; and 

Revenue per available room, or RevPAR, which is total room revenue divided by the total number of available rooms. 

RevPAR changes that are primarily driven by changes in occupancy have different implications for overall revenues and profitability than changes that are driven primarily by changes in ADR. For example, an increase in occupancy at a hotel would lead to additional variable operating costs (such as housekeeping services, laundry, utilities, room supplies, franchise fees, management fees, credit card commissions and reservations expense), but could also result in increased non-room revenue from the hotel s restaurant, banquet or parking facilities. Changes in RevPAR that are primarily driven by changes in ADR typically have a greater impact on operating margins and profitability as they do not generate all the additional variable operating costs associated with higher occupancy. 
 We also use Funds from Operations FFO ), Adjusted FFO and Hotel EBITDA as measures of our operating performance. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures .

Revenue . Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 166.1 million, an increase of approximately 38.5 million, or 30.2 , from total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 of approximately 127.6 million. There was an aggregate increase in total revenue of approximately 45.0 million from 10 of our properties, offset by a decrease of approximately 1.0 million, at the Hyde Beach House Resort Residences, Hollywood and a decrease of approximately 5.5 million as a result of the sales of the Sheraton Louisville Riverside in Jeffersonville, Indiana, in February 2022 and the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone University in Raleigh, North Carolina, in June 2022. There were significant increases in demand primarily driven by the lifting of restrictions on travel, social gatherings and businesses as well as significant increases in demand for business travel compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 Room revenues at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased approximately 21.0 million, or 23.6 , to approximately 109.6 million compared to room revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 of approximately 88.6 million with eleven of our properties experiencing increased occupancies. 
 Food and beverage revenues at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased approximately 13.7 million, or 86.7 , to approximately 29.5 million compared to food and beverage revenues of approximately 15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, with most of our properties experiencing increased demand for food and beverage services as a result of increased occupancy. The increase in food and beverage revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, resulted from an aggregate increase of approximately 14.2 million from ten of our properties, offset by the loss of food and beverage revenue of approximately 0.5 million following the sale of the Sheraton Louisville Riverside, in February 2022 and the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone University in June 2022. 
 Other operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased approximately 3.8 million, or 16.5 , to approximately 26.9 million compared to other operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 of approximately 23.1 million. Increases in parking revenue at many of our properties, as well as approximately 1.0 million of other reimbursed revenue at the Georgian Terrace in Atlanta, Georgia, 1.0 million received under the North Carolina Business Recovery Grant, offset decreases 
 40 
 
 in fees of approximately 1.0 million earned at the Hyde Resort Residences in Hollywood Beach, Florida; a non-recurring 0.2 million in business interruption proceeds earned in the prior year at the Hotel Ballast Wilmington, Tapestry Collection by Hilton in Wilmington, North Carolina; and a non-recurring COVID relief grant of approximately 0.3 million received in the prior period by the DoubleTree by Hilton Laurel in Laurel, Maryland. 
 Hotel Operating Expenses . Hotel operating expenses, which consist of room expenses, food and beverage expenses, other direct expenses, indirect expenses, and management fees, increased approximately 22.9 million, or 23.7 , for the year ended December 31, 2022 to approximately 119.6 million compared to hotel operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 of approximately 96.7 million. The aggregate increase of approximately 28.9 million in hotel operating expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, is directly related to the significant increase in hotel occupancy and gross revenue at all of our properties, which was mainly offset with the sale of the Sheraton Louisville Riverside in February 2022 and the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone University in June 2022, reducing hotel operating expenses by approximately 5.7 million. 
 Rooms expense at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased approximately 3.1 million, or 13.6 , to approximately 25.8 million compared to rooms expense of approximately 22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in rooms expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, resulted from an aggregate increase of approximately 5.0 million from all of our properties, offset by a decrease of approximately 1.9 million as a result of the sale of our properties in Jeffersonville, Indiana and Raleigh, North Carolina. 
 Food and beverage expenses at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased approximately 9.4 million, or 91.5 , to approximately 19.7 million compared to food and beverage expense of approximately 10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The net increase in food and beverage expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, resulted from an aggregate increase of approximately 9.7 million, offset by a decrease of approximately 0.3 million as a result of the sale of our properties in Jeffersonville, Indiana and Raleigh, North Carolina. 
 Expenses from other operating departments increased approximately 0.7 million, or 8.0 , to approximately 9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to expenses from other operating departments of approximately 8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in expenses from other operating departments for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, resulted from aggregate increases in other operating expenses of approximately 1.3 million from ten of our properties. These increases were seen mainly from bringing back parking servicing contractors. Four of our properties, including the properties in Jeffersonville, Indiana and Raleigh, North Carolina, had decreases in other operating expenses aggregating to approximately 0.6 million. 
 Indirect expenses at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased approximately 9.7 million, or 17.6 , to approximately 64.8 million compared to indirect expenses of approximately 55.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in indirect expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, resulted from an aggregate increase in total indirect expenses of approximately 13.1 million, offset by a decrease of approximately 3.4 million as a result of the sale of our properties in Jeffersonville, Indiana and Raleigh, North Carolina. Additionally, we realized refunds of prior year real estate property taxes at our properties in Savannah, Georgia, and the DoubleTree by Hilton Hollywood Beach in Hollywood, Florida, totaling approximately 0.8 million. 
 Depreciation and Amortization . Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased by approximately 1.3 million or 6.3 , to approximately 18.6 million, compared to depreciation and amortization expense of approximately 19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is mainly due to the sale of our properties in Jeffersonville, Indiana and Raleigh, North Carolina. 
 Impairment of Investment in Hotel Properties, Net . The impairment of investment in hotel properties, net for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 0 and approximately 12.2 million, respectively. Our review of possible impairment at two of our hotel properties in 2021 revealed an excess of current carrying costs over the estimated undiscounted cash flows, which was triggered by a reduction in the holding period due to the recent sale of the Sheraton Louisville Riverside and a lack of certainty regarding our ability to extend or refinance the mortgage on The Whitehall in Houston, Texas, which was to mature in 2023. The resulting adjustment to fair market value resulted in a charge of approximately 12.2 million during the period ended December 31, 2021. 
 Corporate General and Administrative . Corporate general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased approximately 0.4 million, or 5.4 , to approximately 6.6 million compared to corporate general and administrative expenses of approximately 7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in corporate general and administrative expenses was mainly due to an employee retention credit of approximately 0.2 million and a reduction of loan fees and other expenses in the aggregate compared to the prior year of approximately 0.2 million. 
 41 
 
 Interest Expense . Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased approximately 2.9 million, or 12.8 , to approximately 19.8 million, compared to approximately 22.7 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in interest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, was substantially related to decreases in the amount of debt attributable to the mortgages on the hotel properties in Jeffersonville, Indiana and Raleigh, North Carolina, sold earlier this year, as well as the extinguishment of the secured notes with KWHP SOHO, LLC KW and MIG SOHO, LLC (the Secured Notes in June 2022. 
 Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. The loss relates to the repayment and cancellation of the Secured Notes in June 2022 resulting in a loss on early extinguishment consisting of the unamortized exit fee as well as the unamortized origination costs, which totaled approximately 5.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. 
 Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Hedging Activities. Unrealized gain (loss) on hedging activities primarily relates to the change in variance between the unamortized cost of the interest-rate swaps related to our mortgages on the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport and the Hotel Alba Tampa, Tapestry Collection by Hilton and the fair value of interest-rate swaps which are affected by both the decreasing number of payment periods in the swap periods and the changes in anticipated LIBOR/SOFR rates over the remaining period. Those factors contributed to an unrealized gain of approximately 2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to an unrealized gain of approximately 1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 PPP loan forgiveness. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we received notification from our banks and the Small Business Administration that we received partial forgiveness on our unsecured notes, relating to the original PPP Loans we received in 2020. We received approximately 4.7 million PPP loan forgiveness, which includes principal forgiveness and the accrued interest on that portion of the loans. 
 Gain on Sale of Assets. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we sold the property in Raleigh, North Carolina for a gain of approximately 30.1 million. 
 Gain on Involuntary Conversion of Assets. Gain on involuntary conversion of assets increased approximately 1.2 million, from approximately 0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to approximately 1.8 million, for the year ended December 31, 2022. The gains were related to casualties at our properties in Savannah, Georgia, Houston, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia. 
 Income Tax Provision . We had an income tax provision of approximately 0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to an income tax provision of approximately 0, for the year ended December 31, 2021. MHI TRS realized an operating gain for the year ended December 31, 2022 and an operating loss for December 31, 2021. 
 Net (Loss) Income. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased approximately 62.5 million, or 219.0 , to approximately 34.0 million, compared to a net loss of approximately 28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as a result of the operating results discussed above. 
 Distributions to Preferred Stockholders . During the year ended December 31, 2022, we accounted for undeclared distributions to preferred stockholders of approximately 7.6 million, compared to declared and undeclared distributions to preferred stockholders of approximately 7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

The increase in revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, was due mainly to the significant increases in demand driven by the lifting of restrictions on travel, social gatherings and businesses; significant increases in demand from transient consumers; increases in travel by some group business and increases in the number of foreign travelers. 
 42 
 
 Room revenues at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased approximately 39.4 million, or 80.2 , to approximately 88.6 million, compared to room revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 of approximately 49.2 million with each of our properties experiencing increased occupancy.

Our properties in Laurel, Maryland, Houston, Texas and Hollywood Beach, Florida experienced decreases in food and beverage revenues collectively totaling approximately 0.5 million. 
 Other operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased approximately 11.5 million, or 98.8 , to approximately 23.1 million, compared to other operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 of approximately 11.6 million. Each of our properties experienced increased other operating revenues for the period with the exception of our property in Raleigh, North Carolina, which was relatively flat. 
 Hotel Operating Expenses . Hotel operating expenses, which consist of room expenses, food and beverage expenses, other direct expenses, indirect expenses, and management fees, increased approximately 22.0 million, or 29.4 , for the year ended December 31, 2021 to approximately 96.7 million, compared to hotel operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 of approximately 74.7 million. The increase in hotel operating expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, is directly related to the significant increase in hotel occupancy and gross revenue at all of our properties. 
 Rooms expense at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased approximately 7.1 million, or 45.8 , to approximately 22.7 million, compared to rooms expense of approximately 15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 Food and beverage expenses at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased approximately 1.8 million, or 20.7 , to approximately 10.3 million, compared to food and beverage expense of approximately 8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 Expenses from other operating departments increased approximately 3.5 million, or 67.4 , to approximately 8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to expenses from other operating departments of approximately 5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The increase in indirect expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, related to an expansion of operations to accommodate increased occupancy. 
 Depreciation and Amortization . Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2021 slightly increased by 0.1 , to approximately 19.9 million, compared to depreciation and amortization expense of approximately 19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 Impairment of Investment in Hotel Properties, Net . The impairment of investment in hotel properties, net for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was approximately 12.2 million and 0, respectively. Our review of possible impairment at two of our hotel properties revealed an excess of current carrying costs over the estimated undiscounted cash flows, which was triggered by a reduction in the holding period due to the recent sale of the Sheraton Louisville Riverside as well as lack of certainty regarding our ability to extend or refinance the mortgage on The Whitehall in Houston, Texas which matures in early 2023. The resulting adjustment to fair market value resulted in a charge of approximately 12.2 million during the period ended December 31, 2021. 
 Corporate General and Administrative . Corporate general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased approximately 0.5 million, or 7.8 , to approximately 7.0 million compared to corporate general and administrative expenses of approximately 6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in corporate general and administrative expenses was mainly due to fees related to an abandoned debt offering as well as fees to the special servicer of our mortgage on the DoubleTree Resort by Hilton Hollywood Beach. 
 Interest Expense . Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased approximately 4.6 million, or 25.6 , to approximately 22.7 million compared to approximately 18.1 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020. Approximately 4.0 million of the increase is related to the Secured Notes issued in December 2020. 
 Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Hedging Activities. Unrealized gain (loss) on hedging activities primarily relates to the change in variance between the unamortized cost of the interest-rate swap related to our mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia 
 43 
 
 Airport and the fair value of that interest-rate swap which is affected by both the decreasing number of payment periods in the swap period and the changes in anticipated LIBOR rates over the remaining period. Those factors contributed to an unrealized gain of approximately 1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to an unrealized loss of approximately 1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 Income Tax (Provision) Benefit . A decrease in our income tax provision of approximately 5.3 million primarily relates to the reduction in the deferred tax asset through a 100 valuation allowance of approximately 5.4 million taken in the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 Net (Loss) Income. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased approximately 25.1 million, or 46.8 , to approximately 28.5 million compared to a net loss of approximately 53.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of the operating results discussed above. 
 Distributions to Preferred Stockholders . During the year ended December 31, 2021, we accounted for undeclared distributions to preferred stockholders of approximately 7.5 million, compared to declared and undeclared distributions to preferred stockholders of approximately 8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Our principal sources of cash are cash from hotel operations, proceeds from the sale of common and preferred stock, proceeds from the sale of secured and unsecured notes, proceeds of mortgage or other debt and hotel property sales. Our principal uses of cash are acquisitions of hotel properties, capital expenditures, debt service and balloon maturities, operating costs, corporate expenses and dividends. As of December 31, 2022, we had unrestricted cash of approximately 21.9 million and restricted cash of approximately 5.4 million. 
 Operating Activities . Our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 6.7 million, generally consisting of net cash flow provided by hotel operations. The positive cash flow from operations during the year was due to the increase in occupancy at our hotels as a result of increases in transient consumers, group business, and other business travel due to the lifting of restrictions on travel, social gatherings and business operations. Our cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was approximately 2.3 million. Cash used in or provided by operating activities generally consists of the cash flow from hotel operations, offset by the interest portion of our debt service, corporate expenses and positive or negative changes in working capital. 
 Investing Activities. Our cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 46.7 million. Of this amount approximately 10.9 million came from the sale of Sheraton Louisville Riverside property and approximately 41.5 million came from the sale of the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone University property. We spent approximately 8.0 million on capital expenditures on improvements to our hotel properties, including the replacement and refurbishment of furniture, fixtures and equipment. We also received insurance proceeds related to involuntary conversions of approximately 2.2 million. Cash used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was approximately 2.4 million which mostly consisted of capital expenditures of approximately 3.2 million offset by insurance proceeds related to involuntary conversion of approximately 0.6 million. 
 Financing Activities . Our cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, was approximately 51.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company and Operating Partnership received proceeds of 7.8 million from the refinance of the Hotel Alba mortgage loan, made principal payments on its mortgages of approximately 38.5 million, including the extinguishment of debt related to the sale of the Sheraton Louisville Riverside and the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone University. In addition, the Company extinguished debt on its Secured Notes of 20.0 million, paid approximately 0.4 million in deferred financing costs. We also paid approximately 0.5 million to reduce the principal balance outstanding of unsecured notes. Cash used in financial activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, was approximately 9.7 million, which included approximately 6.5 million in scheduled payments of principal on our mortgage loans and approximately 3.1 million in payments on our unsecured notes.

 Capital Expenditures 
 We intend to maintain all our hotels, including any hotel we acquire in the future, in good repair and condition, in conformity with applicable laws and regulations and, when applicable, with franchisor s standards. Routine capital improvements are determined through the annual budget process over which we maintain approval rights, and which are implemented or administered by our management company. 
 From time to time, certain of our hotel properties may undergo renovations as a result of our decision to upgrade portions of the hotel, such as guestrooms, meeting space and restaurants, in order to better compete with other hotels in our markets. In addition, we may be required by one or more of our franchisors to complete a property improvement program PIP in order to bring the hotel up to the franchisor s standards. Generally, we expect to fund renovations and improvements out of working capital, including restricted cash, proceeds of mortgage debt or equity offerings. 
 Historically, we have aimed to maintain overall capital expenditures, except for those required by our franchisors as a condition to a franchise license or license renewal, at 4.0 of gross revenue. In early 2020, we postponed all major non-essential capital expenditures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As travel demand returned and occupancy, and RevPAR gradually increased, we increased the level of capital expenditures. We expect total capital expenditures for 2023 to be approximately 7.3 million. 
 We expect capital expenditures for the recurring replacement or refurbishment of furniture, fixtures and equipment at our properties will be funded by our replacement reserve accounts, other than costs that we incur to make capital improvements required by our franchisors. Reserve accounts are escrowed accounts with funds deposited monthly and reserved for capital improvements or expenditures with respect to all of our hotels. Except as temporarily reduced during the pandemic through loan modifications and forbearance agreements, we deposit an amount equal to 4.0 of gross revenue for The DeSoto, the Hotel Ballast Wilmington, the DoubleTree Resort by Hilton Hollywood Beach, The DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront, The Whitehall and the Georgian Terrace as well as 4.0 of room revenues for the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport and the Hyatt Centric Arlington on a monthly basis. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant negative impact on our operations and financial results during 2020, 2021 and 2022. 
 During 2020 and into 2021, we entered into forbearance agreements with all our mortgage lenders and negotiated extended payment terms with a few key vendors in order to preserve liquidity. Repayment of deferred amounts of interest, mortgage principal and amounts due certain vendors, which began in 2021, was completed at the end of 2022, with the exception of certain amounts that were deferred until the maturity of the applicable loan. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of approximately 27.3 million, of which approximately 5.4 million was in restricted reserve accounts for cash collateral, capital improvements, real estate tax and insurance escrows. We expect that our cash on hand combined with our cash flow from our hotels should be adequate to fund continuing operations, recurring capital expenditures for the refurbishment and replacement of furniture, fixtures and equipment, and monthly scheduled payments of principal and interest (excluding any balloon payments due upon maturity of our mortgage debt or secured notes). 
 On June 10, 2022, we sold the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone University which generated net proceeds of approximately 19.8 million, which we used to repay a portion of the Secured Notes and the associated repayment factor. Also in June 2022, we refinanced the Hotel Alba mortgage and generated proceeds of approximately 7.5 million, which we used to pay the remainder of the Secured Notes and accrued interest in combination with approximately 2.3 million of unrestricted and restricted cash. 
 On February 26, 2023, we amended the mortgage loan agreement on The Whitehall hotel located in Houston, TX with the existing lender, International Bank of Commerce. The amendment (i) extends the loan's maturity date to February 26, 2028; (ii) maintains a floating rate of interest of New York Prime Rate plus 1.25 ; and (iii) subjects the interest rate to a floor rate of 7.50 . The mortgage loan continues to be guaranteed by the Operating Partnership. The amendment also requires us to establish a real estate tax reserve as well as a debt service reserve that approximates the aggregate amount of one year's debt service, which was initially established at approximately 1.5 million. 
 As of the date of this report, we were current on all loan payments on all other mortgages per the terms of our mortgage agreements, as amended. We were in compliance with all loan covenants except the Debt Service Coverage Requirement DSCR covenant under the mortgage secured by The Whitehall and the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport. We have received a 
 45 
 
 waiver of the financial covenants from the lender of the mortgage on The Whitehall, as well as the lender of the mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport through December 31, 2022. 
 In 2023, the mortgages on the DoubleTree by Hilton Laurel and the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport mature. We intend to refinance the mortgages maturing in 2023 at the level of their existing indebtedness or request extensions at existing terms. 
 We intend to continue to invest in hotel properties as suitable opportunities arise. The success of our acquisition strategy depends, in part, on our ability to access additional capital through other sources. There can be no assurance that we will continue to make investments in properties that meet our investment criteria or have access to capital during this period. Additionally, we may choose to dispose of certain hotels as a means to provide liquidity. 
 Over the long term, we expect to meet our liquidity requirements for hotel property acquisitions, property redevelopment, investments in new joint ventures and debt maturities, and the retirement of maturing mortgage debt, through net proceeds from additional issuances of common shares, additional issuances of preferred shares, issuances of units of limited partnership interest in our Operating Partnership, secured and unsecured borrowings, the selective disposition of non-core assets, and cash on hand. We remain committed to a flexible capital structure and strive to maintain prudent debt leverage. 
 Mortgage Debt 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had a principal mortgage debt balance of approximately 321.9 million. The following table sets forth our mortgage debt obligations on our hotels.

 Financial Covenants 
 Mortgage Loans 
 Our mortgage loan agreements contain various financial covenants directly related to the financial performance of the collateralized properties. Failure to comply with these financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in the local competitive environment, disruption caused by renovation activity, major weather disturbances, general economic conditions as well as the changes in business travel patterns and demand following the global pandemic. 
 As described in Liquidity and Capital Resources , we failed to meet certain financial covenants under the mortgages secured by The Whitehall and the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport. We have received a waiver of the financial covenants from the lender of the mortgage on The Whitehall, as well as the lender of the mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport, through December 31, 2022. 
 Certain of our loan agreements also include financial covenants that trigger a cash trap , requiring substantially all the revenue generated by the hotel to be deposited directly into a lockbox account and swept into a cash management account for the benefit of the lender until the property meets the criteria in the loan agreement for exiting the cash trap . 
 Contractual Obligations

Dividend Policy 
 Distributions to Stockholders and Holders of Units in the Operating Partnership . The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2004. To maintain qualification as a REIT, the Company is required to make annual distributions to its stockholders of at least 90.0 of our REIT taxable income, (excluding net capital gain, which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles). The Company s ability to pay distributions to its stockholders will depend, in part, upon its receipt of distributions from the Operating Partnership which may depend upon receipt of lease payments with respect to our properties from our TRS Lessees, and in turn, upon the management of our properties by our hotel manager. Distributions to the Company s stockholders will generally be taxable to the Company s stockholders as ordinary income; however, because a portion of our investments are equity ownership interests in hotels, which will result in depreciation and noncash charges against our income, a portion of our distributions may constitute a non-taxable return of capital. To the extent not inconsistent with maintaining the Company s REIT status, our TRS Lessees may retain any after-tax earnings. 
 Distributions to Preferred Stockholders and Holder of Preferred Partnership Units in the Operating Partnership. The Company is obligated to pay distributions to its holders of Preferred Stock and the Operating Partnership is obligated to pay its preferred unit holder, the Company. Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock are entitled to receive distributions when authorized by the Company s board of directors out of assets legally available for the payment of distributions. 
 In March 2020, we announced that the record date for the dividends on the Company s Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, and Series D Preferred Stock, originally set for March 31, 2020, with a payment date of April 15, 2020, had been deferred. No dividends have been declared since that date. The Company may not make distributions with respect to any shares of its common stock, unless and until full cumulative distributions on the outstanding preferred stock for all past unpaid periods are paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof in cash is set aside. As of December 31, 2022, the amount of cumulative unpaid dividends on our outstanding preferred shares was approximately 23.9 million and the aggregate liquidation preference with respect to our outstanding preferred shares was approximately 121.3 million. The preferred stock is not redeemable by the holders, has no maturity date and is not convertible into any other security of the Company or its affiliates, except in the event of a change of control. 
 47 
 
 On January 24, 2023, the Company announced it will resume quarterly distributions to holders of its preferred stock and set a record date of February 28, 2023 and a payment date of March 15, 2023 for the preferred distributions declared in January 2020. 
 The Company expects that any reduction in the level of cumulative unpaid distributions will be made in the form of a series of special distributions. The amount, timing and frequency of distributions will be authorized by the Company s board of directors and declared by the Company based upon a variety of factors deemed relevant by its directors and no assurance can be given that its distribution policy will not change in the future. 
 Inflation 
 We generate revenues primarily from lease payments from our TRS Lessees and net income from the operations of our TRS Lessees. Therefore, we rely primarily on the performance of the individual properties and the ability of the management company to increase revenues and to keep pace with inflation. Operators of hotels, in general, possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to keep pace with inflation. However, competitive pressures at some or all of our hotels may limit the ability of the management company to raise room rates. 
 Our expenses, including hotel operating expenses, administrative expenses, real estate taxes, and property and casualty insurance are subject to inflation. These expenses are expected to grow with the general rate of inflation, except for energy, liability insurance, property and casualty insurance, property tax rates, employee benefits, and some wages, which may vary at rates that differ from the general rate of inflation. 
 Geographic Concentration and Seasonality 
 Our hotels are located in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia. As a result, we are particularly susceptible to adverse market conditions in these geographic areas, including industry downturns, relocation of businesses and any oversupply of hotel rooms or a reduction in lodging demand. Adverse economic developments in the markets in which we have a concentration of hotels, or in any of the other markets in which we operate, or any increase in hotel supply or decrease in lodging demand resulting from the local, regional or national business climate, could materially and adversely affect us. 
 The operations of our hotel properties have historically been seasonal. The months of April and May are traditionally strong, as is October. The periods from mid-November through mid-February are traditionally slow with the exception of hotels located in certain markets, namely Florida and Texas, which experience significant room demand during this period. 
 Competition 
 The hotel industry is highly competitive with various participants competing on the basis of price, level of service and geographic location. Each of our hotels is located in a developed area that includes other hotel properties. The number of competitive hotel properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on occupancy, ADR and RevPAR of our hotels or at hotel properties acquired in the future. We believe that brand recognition, location, the quality of the hotel, consistency of services provided, and price, are the principal competitive factors affecting our hotels. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our consolidated financial statements, prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liability at the date of our financial statements, the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following accounting policies are critical because they require difficult, subjective and complex judgments and include estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain, involve various assumptions, require management judgment, and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our financial position, results of operations and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis, based on information that is available to us, our historical experiences and various matters that we believe are reasonable and appropriate for consideration under the circumstances. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates due to changes in judgments, assumptions and conditions as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise, which could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 
 Investment in Hotel Properties . Hotel properties are stated at cost, net of any impairment charges, and are depreciated using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of 7-39 years for buildings and improvements and 3-10 years for furniture and equipment. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the controlling interests in hotels comprising our accounting predecessor, MHI Hotels Services Group, and noncontrolling interests held by the controlling holders of our accounting predecessor in 
 48 
 
 hotels, which were acquired from third parties contributed to us in connection with the Company s initial public offering, are recorded at historical cost basis. Noncontrolling interests in those entities that comprise our accounting predecessor and the interests in hotels, other than those held by the controlling members of our accounting predecessor, acquired from third parties are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition. 
 We review our hotel properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the hotel properties may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may cause us to perform our review include, but are not limited to, adverse permanent changes in the demand for lodging at our properties due to declining national or local economic conditions and/or new hotel construction in markets where our hotels are located. When such conditions exist, management performs a recoverability analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operating activities and the estimated proceeds from the ultimate disposition of a hotel property exceed its carrying value. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are found to be less than the carrying amount of the hotel property, an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to the related hotel property s estimated fair market value would be recorded and an impairment loss recognized. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has had, an adverse impact on the lodging and hospitality industries, which the Company considered to be a triggering event for each of its hotels during its impairment testing for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company assessed the recoverability of each of its hotel properties which included a projection of future operating cash flows based upon significant assumptions regarding its ability to maintain ownership of the property, growth rates, occupancy, room rates, economic trends, property-specific operating costs, an allowance for the replacement of furniture, fixtures and equipment and projected cash flows from the eventual disposition of the hotel. The Company also projected cash flows assuming an eventual disposition of the hotel based upon property-specific capitalization rates. As of December 31, 2021, the Company determined the Sheraton Louisville Riverside, to be impaired based on the proceeds received in a subsequent sale, as well as The Whitehall in Houston, Texas due to the lack of certainty regarding our ability to extend or refinance the mortgage which was set to mature in early 2023. The Company recognized an impairment loss of approximately 12.2 million during the period ended December 31, 2021. The impairment loss was determined using level 2 inputs under authoritative guidance for fair value measurements. No impairment loss was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Income Taxes. The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to federal income tax. The MHI TRS Entities which leases our hotels from subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, are subject to federal and state income taxes. 
 We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. A valuation allowance is required for deferred tax assets if, based on all available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will or will not be realized due to the inability to generate sufficient taxable income in certain financial statement periods. The more-likely-than-not analysis means the likelihood of realization is greater than 50 , that we either will or will not be able to fully utilize the deferred tax assets against future taxable income. The net amount of deferred tax assets that are recorded on the financial statements must reflect the tax benefits that are expected to be realized using these criteria. As of December 31, 2022, we have determined that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not be able to fully utilize our deferred tax assets for future tax consequences, therefore a 100 valuation allowance is required. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, deferred tax assets each totaled 0, respectively. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had no uncertain tax positions. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2022, the tax years that remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions to which the Company is subject generally include 2016 through 2020. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, the tax years that remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions to which the MHI TRS Entities are subject, because of open NOL carryforwards, generally include 2014 through 2021. 
 The Operating Partnership is generally not subject to federal and state income taxes as the unit holders of the Partnership are subject to tax on their respective shares of the Partnership s taxable income. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 For a summary of recently adopted and newly issued accounting pronouncements, please refer to the New Accounting Pronouncements section of Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We consider the non-GAAP financial measures of FFO available to common stockholders and unitholders (including FFO per common share and unit), Adjusted FFO available to common stockholders and unitholders, EBITDA and Hotel EBITDA to be key 
 49 
 
 supplemental measures of the Company s performance and could be considered along with, not alternatives to, net income (loss) as a measure of the Company s performance. These measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities determined by generally accepted accounting principles GAAP or amounts available for the Company s discretionary use and should not be considered alternative measures of net income, cash flows from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP. 
 FFO and Adjusted FFO . Industry analysts and investors use FFO, as a supplemental operating performance measure of an equity REIT. FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ). FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents net income or loss determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, gains or losses from involuntary conversion of assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization or impairment, stock compensation costs and after adjustment for any noncontrolling interest from unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by itself. 
 We consider FFO to be a useful measure of adjusted net income (loss) for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because we believe FFO is most directly comparable to net income (loss), which remains the primary measure of performance, because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization, FFO assists in comparing the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. Although FFO is intended to be a REIT industry standard, other companies may not calculate FFO in the same manner as we do, and investors should not assume that FFO as reported by us is comparable to FFO as reported by other REITs. 
 We further adjust FFO Available to Common Stockholders and Unitholders for certain additional items that are not in NAREIT s definition of FFO, including changes in deferred income taxes, any unrealized gain (loss) on hedging instruments or warrant derivative, loan impairment losses, losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains on extinguishment of preferred stock, aborted offering costs, loan modification fees, franchise termination costs, costs associated with the departure of executive officers, litigation settlement, over-assessed real estate taxes on appeal, management contract termination costs, operating asset depreciation and amortization, change in control gains or losses, ESOP and stock compensation expenses and acquisition transaction costs. We exclude these items as we believe it allows for meaningful comparisons between periods and among other REITs and is more indicative than FFO of the on-going performance of our business and assets. Our calculation of adjusted FFO may be different from similar measures calculated by other REITs. 
 The following is a reconciliation of net income (loss) to FFO and Adjusted FFO for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.

Hotel EBITDA . We define Hotel EBITDA as net income or loss excluding: (1) interest expense, (2) interest income, (3) income tax provision or benefit, (4) depreciation and amortization, (5) impairment of long-lived assets or investments, (6) gains and losses on disposal and/or sale of assets, (7) gains and losses on involuntary conversions of assets, (8) unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments not included in other comprehensive income, (9) loss on early debt extinguishment, (10) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) debt forgiveness, (11) gain on exercise of development right, (12) corporate general and administrative expense, and (13) other operating revenue not related to our portfolio. We believe this provides a more complete understanding of the operating results over which our wholly-owned hotels and its operators have direct control. We believe hotel EBITDA provides investors with supplemental information on the on-going operational performance of our hotels and the effectiveness of third-party management companies operating our business on a property-level basis. 
 Our calculation of Hotel EBITDA may be different from similar measures calculated by other REITs. 
 The following is a reconciliation of net loss to Hotel EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures about Market Risk 
 The effects of potential changes in interest rates are discussed below. Our market risk discussion includes forward-looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that could occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates. These disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future losses, but only indicators of reasonably possible losses. As a result, actual future results may differ materially from those presented. The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates. 
 To meet in part our long-term liquidity requirements, we will borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates. Our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. From time to time we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as collars and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments. We do not intend to hold or issue derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 310.2 million of fixed-rate debt, including the mortgage on our DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport hotel, which is fixed by an interest rate swap to 5.237 , the mortgage on our Hotel Alba Tampa, Tapestry Collection by Hilton, which is fixed by an interest rate swap to 5.576 and the PPP Loans of 2.5 million, with a fixed rate of 1.0 and approximately 14.2 million of variable-rate debt. The weighted-average interest rate on the fixed-rate debt was 4.83 . A change in market interest rates on the fixed portion of our debt would impact the fair value of the debt but have no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. Our variable-rate debt is exposed to changes in interest rates, specifically the changes in 1-month LIBOR, SOFR, and in Prime Rate. Assuming that the aggregate amount outstanding on the mortgage on The Whitehall remains at approximately 14.2 million, the balance at December 31, 2022, the impact on our annual interest incurred and cash flows of a one percent increase in 1-month LIBOR, SOFR, and in Prime Rate, would be approximately 0.1 million. 
 As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 330.0 million of fixed-rate debt, including the mortgage on our DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport hotel, which is fixed by an interest rate swap to 5.237 , Secured Notes of 20.0 million with a fixed rate of 6.0 , the PPP Loan of 7.6 million, with a fixed rate of 1.0 and approximately 50.2 million of variable-rate debt. The 
 51 
 
 weighted-average interest rate on the fixed-rate debt was 4.77 . A change in market interest rates on the fixed portion of our debt would impact the fair value of the debt but have no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. Our variable-rate debt is exposed to changes in interest rates, specifically the changes in 1-month LIBOR and in Prime Rate. Assuming that the aggregate amount outstanding on the mortgages on the Hotel Alba, The Whitehall and the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone-University remains at approximately 50.2 million, the balance at December 31, 2021, the impact on our annual interest incurred and cash flows of a one percent increase in 1-month LIBOR and in Prime Rate, would be approximately 0.2 million.

 The Company s management, under the supervision and participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act), as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, its disclosure controls and procedures were effective and designed to ensure that (i) information required to be disclosed in its reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and instructions, and (ii) information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 The Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures or its internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of the controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Sotherly Hotels Inc. have been detected. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). The Company s management assessed the effectiveness over internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, the Company s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework. The Company s management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria. 
 This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the exemption provided to issuers that are not large accelerated filers or accelerated filers under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.

Report of Inde pendent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Sotherly Hotels Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sotherly Hotels Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 
 
 We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Evaluation of investments in hotel properties for impairment 
 As of December 31, 2022, Investment in Hotel Properties was 365.1 Million. As discussed in Note 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company assesses the carrying values of its investments in hotel properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the hotel properties may not be recoverable. When such conditions exist, management performs an analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operations and the proceeds from the ultimate disposition of a hotel property exceeds its carrying value. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are found to be less than the carrying amount of the asset and the carrying amount exceeds its fair market value, an adjustment to reduce the carrying amount to the related hotel property s fair market value would be recorded and an impairment loss recognized. 
 
 We identified the Company s evaluation of hotel properties for impairment as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination included the significant auditor judgments required to evaluate certain key inputs and assumptions used by the Company in developing their impairment assessment, specifically, the judgments related to the Company s determination of growth rates, occupancy, room rates, economic trends, property-specific operating costs and an allowance for the replacement of furniture, fixtures and equipment used in projecting cash flows from operations and capitalization rates utilized in determining eventual disposition. 
 
 F - 2 
 
 The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: 
 We obtained an understanding of and tested the design and effectiveness of internal controls over the Company s impairment analysis. 

We acquired an understanding of the Company s impairment methodology to assess the life of the cash flows and recoverability of the investments in hotel properties. 

We assessed the appropriateness of the significant assumptions and inputs, such as growth rates, occupancy, room rates, economic trends, property-specific operating costs and an allowance for the replacement of furniture, fixtures and equipment based on Company-specific data and published industry data. 

We tested the mathematical accuracy of management s impairment analysis. 

We performed a sensitivity analysis over the estimated capitalization rates obtained from published industry reports. 

We reviewed the methodologies and assumptions utilized by the Company s third-party specialist for reasonableness.

These agreements constituted a transaction whereby the Investors purchased million in Secured Notes (the Secured Notes from the Operating Partnership. On June 29, 2022, the Company satisfied and paid in full the Secured Notes. On November 30, 2021, Raleigh Hotel Associates, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and an affiliate of the Company, entered into a real estate sale agreement to sell the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh-Brownstone University hotel located in Raleigh, North Carolina to CS Acquisition Vehicle, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, for a purchase price of million.

On February 10, 2022, the Company closed the sale of the Sheraton Louisville Riverside hotel. There were net proceeds from the sale. On June 10, 2022, we closed the sale of the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh-Brownstone University hotel. The Company used approximately million of the net cash proceeds from the sale of the hotel to repay the existing mortgage on the property and approximately million of the net cash proceeds to repay a portion of the Secured Notes with the Investors as required by the terms of the Secured Notes. The Company used the remaining net cash proceeds general corporate purposes. The Investors received approximately million of the proceeds from the sale of the hotel, of which approximately million was applied toward principal, approximately million was applied toward the exit fee owed under the Secured Notes, and approximately million was applied toward accrued interest. Additionally, the terms of the Secured Notes allowed for the release of a portion of the interest reserves in the amount of approximately million, of which approximately million was applied toward principal and approximately million was applied toward the exit fee. On June 28, 2022, affiliates of the Company entered into amended loan documents to modify the existing mortgage loan on the Hotel Alba Tampa with the existing lender, Fifth Third Bank. Pursuant to the amended loan documents, the amended mortgage loan: (i) has an increased principal balance of million; (ii) includes an extended maturity date of , which may be further extended for two additional periods of one year each, subject to certain conditions; (iii) bears a floating interest rate of SOFR plus , subject to a floor rate of ; (iv) amortizes on a schedule and requires payments of monthly interest plus monthly amortization payments; and (v) is guaranteed by the Operating Partnership up to million, with the guaranty reducing to million upon the successful achievement of certain performance milestones. On June 29, 2022, the Company used the proceeds from the refinance of the Hotel Alba Tampa, along with approximately million of cash on hand as well as the balance of the interest reserve under the Secured Notes of approximately million, to satisfy and pay in full the Secured Notes.

Concurrent with the cancellation of the Secured Notes, the following agreements were also terminated in accordance with their terms: (i) Note Purchase Agreement; (ii) Pledge and Security Agreement; (iii) Board Observer Agreement; and (iv) other related ancillary agreements. From June 21, 2021 through August 24, 2022, the Company entered into various privately-negotiated share exchange agreements with holders of its Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock, in reliance on Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act. Pursuant to those share exchange agreements, the Company has exchanged an aggregate of 3,0393,995 shares of its common stock for shares of the Series B Preferred Stock, shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, and shares of the Series D Preferred Stock, together with all of the holder s rights to receive accrued and unpaid dividends on those shares of Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, and Series D Preferred Stock. The common stock was issued in reliance on the exemption from registration set forth in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, as amended, for securities exchanged by an issuer with an existing security holder in a transaction where no commission or other remuneration was be paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting such an exchange. 

to for buildings and building improvements and to for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the useful lives of the related assets. The Company assesses the carrying values of its investments in hotel properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the hotel properties may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may cause a review include, but are not limited to, adverse permanent changes in the demand for lodging at the properties due to declining national or local economic conditions and/or new hotel construction in markets where the hotels are located. When such conditions exist, management performs an analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operations and the proceeds from the ultimate disposition of a hotel property exceeds its carrying value. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are found to be less than the carrying amount of the asset, an adjustment to reduce the carrying amount to the related hotel property s estimated fair market value would be recorded and an impairment loss recognized. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, an adverse impact on the lodging and hospitality industries, which the Company considered to be a triggering event for each of its hotels during its impairment testing for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company assessed the recoverability of each of its hotel properties which included a projection of future operating cash flows based upon significant assumptions regarding its ability to maintain ownership of the property, growth rates, occupancy, room rates, economic trends, property-specific operating costs, an allowance for the replacement of furniture, fixtures and equipment and projected cash flows from the eventual disposition of the hotel. The Company also projected cash flows assuming an eventual disposition of the hotel based upon property-specific capitalization rates. As of December 31, 2021, the Company determined the Sheraton Louisville Riverside, to be impaired based on the proceeds received in a subsequent sale, as well as The Whitehall in Houston, Texas due to the lack of certainty regarding our ability to extend or refinance the mortgage which was set to mature in early 2023. The Company recognized an impairment loss of approximately million during the period ended December 31, 2021. The impairment loss was determined using level 2 inputs under authoritative guidance for fair value measurements. impairment loss was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2022.

other accrued liabilities . Right of use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Variable lease payments are excluded from the right of use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. As our leases do not provide an implicit financing rate, we use our incremental borrowing cost based on information available at the commencement date using our actual borrowing rates commensurate with the lease terms and fully levered borrowing to determine present value. Extension options on our leases are included in our minimum lease terms when they are reasonably certain to be exercised. 
 , that we either will or will not be able to fully utilize the deferred tax assets against future taxable income. The net amount of deferred tax assets that are recorded on the financial statements must reflect the tax benefits that are expected to be realized using these criteria. As of December 31, 2022, we determined that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not be able to fully utilize our deferred tax assets for future tax consequences; therefore, a valuation allowance is required. As of December 31, 2022 , we had uncertain tax positions. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2022, the tax years that remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions to which the Company is subject generally include 2011 through 2021. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, the tax years that remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions to which the MHI TRS Entities are subject, because of open NOL carryforwards, generally include 2014 through 2021. The Operating Partnership is generally not subject to federal and state income taxes as the unit holders of the Partnership are subject to tax on their respective shares of the Partnership s taxable income. 
 shares of common stock. The Company believes that stock awards align the interests of its employees with those of its stockholders. Under the 2013 Plan, the Company made cumulative stock awards totaling shares, of which were originally restricted. As of December 31, 2022 , there were restricted shares to certain executives, directors, and employees, and non-restricted shares issued to certain executives, directors and employees. All awards have vested except for shares issued to certain executives, which will vest over the next years. The remaining shares have been deregistered. Under the 2013 Plan, the Company was authorized to issue a variety of performance-based stock awards, including nonqualified stock options. The value of the awards is charged to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting or service period based on the value of the award as determined by the Company s stock price on the date of grant or issuance. As of December 31, 2022 , performance-based stock awards have been granted. Consequently, stock-based compensation as determined under the fair-value method would be the same under the intrinsic-value method. The Company s 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2022 Plan ), which the Company s stockholders approved in April 2022, permits the grant of stock options, restricted stock, unrestricted stock and performance share compensation awards to its employees and directors for up to shares of common stock. Under the 2022 Plan, the Company may issue a variety of performance-based stock awards, including nonqualified stock options. The value of the awards is charged to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting or service period based on the value of the award as determined by the Company s stock price on the date of grant or issuance. As of December 31, 2022 , service-based stock awards have been granted. Total stock-based compensation cost recognized under the 2013 Plan and 2022 Plan for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was , and , respectively. Additionally, the Company sponsors and maintains an Employee Stock Ownership Plan ESOP and related trust for the benefit of its eligible employees. We reflect unearned ESOP shares as a reduction of stockholders equity. Dividends on unearned ESOP shares, when paid, are considered compensation expense. The Company recognizes compensation expense equal to the fair value of the Company s ESOP shares during the periods in which they are committed to be released. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 the ESOP compensation cost was , and , respectively. To the extent that the fair value of the Company s ESOP shares differs from the cost of such shares, the differential is recognized as additional paid in capital. Because the ESOP is internally leveraged through a loan from the Company to the ESOP, the loan receivable by the Company from the ESOP is not reported as an asset nor is the debt of the ESOP shown as a liability in the Company s consolidated financial statements.

Due to the economic uncertainty the COVID-19 pandemic has produced upon tax-planning strategies and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are realizable, as of December 31, 2022, the Company believes is not more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these assets. Therefore, the Company has determined that a full valuation allowance should be recorded against the deferred tax asset. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered unrealizable, however, could change in the future based on revised estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period.

The effect of allocated and committed to be released shares during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, have not been included in the weighted average diluted earnings per share calculation, since there would be an anti-dilutive effect from the dilution by these shares, although the amount of compensation for allocated shares is reflected in net loss available to common stockholders for basic computation.

 The following is a summary of the material terms of the Company s common stock and the Preferred Stock. It is not a complete description of the Maryland General Corporation Law MGCL ), the Company s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the Charter ), the Company s Articles Supplementary establishing and fixing the rights and preferences of each series of the Preferred Stock (collectively the Articles Supplementary or the Company s Second Amended and Restated Bylaws (the Bylaws ). This summary is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the Charter, the Articles Supplementary, the Bylaws, and the applicable provisions of the MGCL. Each of the Charter, Articles Supplementary and Bylaws are incorporated by reference herein and as exhibits to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K with which this exhibit was filed. The terms the Company, Sotherly, we, our, or us means Sotherly Hotels Inc. 
 All Classes of Our Capital Stock 
 General 
 The Charter authorizes the Company to issue up to 69,000,000 shares of common stock and 11,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which 1,851,500 is designated as Series B, 1,700,000 is designated as Series C, and 1,242,000 is designated as Series D.

 The Company previously issued shares of its Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to a private transaction. All shares of the Series A Preferred Stock have been redeemed and the Company does not intend to issue shares of the Series A Preferred Stock in the future. 
 The transfer agent and securities registrar for the Company s common stock and Preferred Stock is American Stock Transfer Trust Company, LLC. 
 Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer . 
 For Sotherly to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), the Company s shares of stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a 

taxable year of 12 months (other than the first year for which the Company s REIT election became effective) or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. Also, not more than 50.0 of the value of the outstanding shares of stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year (other than the first year for which the Company s REIT election became effective). In addition, we cannot receive significant amounts of rents from tenants that are related to us, directly or constructively, through ownership. 
 Because the board of directors believes it is beneficial at present for the Company to qualify as a REIT, the Charter, subject to certain exceptions, contains restrictions on the number of shares of the Company s common stock that a person may own. The Charter provides that no person may own, or be deemed to own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Code, more than 9.9 (the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit in value of its outstanding shares of stock. In addition, the Charter prohibits any person from acquiring or holding, directly or indirectly, shares of common stock in excess of 9.9 of the number of Sotherly s outstanding shares of common stock (the Common Stock Ownership Limit ). Additionally, the Articles Supplementary prohibit any person from acquiring or holding, directly or indirectly, shares of any one class of Preferred Stock in excess of 9.9 of the number of Sotherly s outstanding Preferred Stock in that class (the Preferred Stock Ownership Limit ). 
 Sotherly s Charter prohibits (a) any person from beneficially or constructively owning its shares of stock that would result in us being closely held under Section 856(h) of the Code, (b) any person from transferring Sotherly s shares of stock if such transfer would result in Sotherly s shares of stock being owned by fewer than 100 persons, (c) any transfer that would cause us to own, directly or indirectly, 10.0 or more of the ownership interests in a tenant of the Company (or a tenant of the Sotherly Hotels LP the Operating Partnership ), of which the Company is the sole general partner and through which the Company conducts virtually all of its activities, or any entity owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the Operating Partnership) other than a taxable REIT subsidiary if the requirements of Section 856(d)(8)(B) of the Code are satisfied and (d) any transfer that would cause any of our hotel management companies to fail to qualify as an eligible independent contractor within the meaning of Section 856(d)(9) of the Code. Any person who acquires or attempts or intends to acquire beneficial or constructive ownership of Sotherly s shares of stock that will or may violate any of the foregoing restrictions on transferability and ownership, or any person who would have owned Sotherly s shares of stock that resulted in a transfer of shares to the Charitable Trust (as defined below), is required to give written notice immediately to us, or in the case of a proposed or attempted transaction, to give at least 15 days prior written notice, and provide us with such other information as we may request in order to determine the effect of such transfer on our status as a REIT. The foregoing restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply if Sotherly s board of directors determines that it is no longer in its best interests to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT. 
 Furthermore, Sotherly s board of directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt a proposed transferee from the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit, the Common Stock Ownership Limit, the Preferred Stock Ownership Limit, and/or any of the restrictions described in the first sentence of the paragraph directly above (an Excepted Holder ). However, the board of directors may not grant such an exemption to any person if such exemption would result in our failing to qualify as a REIT. Sotherly s board of directors may require a ruling from the IRS or an opinion of counsel, in either case in form and substance satisfactory to the board of directors, in its sole discretion, in order to determine or ensure Sotherly s status as a REIT. 
 If any transfer of Sotherly s shares of stock occurs which, if effective, would result in any person beneficially or constructively owning shares of stock in excess or in violation of the above transfer or ownership limitations (a Prohibited Owner ), then that number of shares of stock the beneficial or constructive ownership of which otherwise would cause such person to violate such limitations (rounded to the nearest whole share) shall be automatically transferred to a trust (the Charitable Trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more charitable beneficiaries (the Charitable Beneficiary ), and the Prohibited Owner shall not acquire any rights in such shares. Such automatic transfer shall be deemed to be effective as of the close of business on the Business Day (as defined in the Charter) prior to the date of such violative transfer. If any automatic transfer to the Charitable Trust 
 2 

is not effective, then the initial transfer of stock will be void ab initio to the extent necessary to prevent a violation of the above transfer or ownership limitations. Shares of stock held in the Charitable Trust shall be issued and outstanding shares of stock. The Prohibited Owner shall not benefit economically from ownership of any shares of stock held in the Charitable Trust, shall have no rights to dividends or other distributions and shall not possess any rights to vote or other rights attributable to the shares of stock held in the Charitable Trust. The trustee of the Charitable Trust (the Trustee shall have all voting rights and rights to dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of stock held in the Charitable Trust, which rights shall be exercised for the exclusive benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary. Any dividend or other distribution paid prior to our discovery that shares of stock have been transferred to the Trustee shall be paid by the recipient of such dividend or distribution to the Trustee upon demand, and any dividend or other distribution authorized but unpaid shall be paid when due to the Trustee. Any dividend or distribution so paid to the Trustee shall be held in trust for the Charitable Beneficiary. The Prohibited Owner shall have no voting rights with respect to shares of stock held in the Charitable Trust and, subject to Maryland law, effective as of the date that such shares of stock have been transferred to the Trustee, the Trustee shall have the authority (at the Trustee s sole discretion) (i) to rescind as void any vote cast by a Prohibited Owner prior to our discovery that such shares have been transferred to the Trustee and (ii) to recast such vote in accordance with the desires of the Trustee acting for the benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary. However, if we have already taken irreversible corporate action, then the Trustee shall not have the authority to rescind and recast such vote. 
 Within 20 days of receiving notice from us that shares of stock have been transferred to the Charitable Trust, the Trustee shall sell the shares of stock held in the Charitable Trust to a person, designated by the Trustee, whose ownership of the shares will not violate the ownership limitations set forth in the Charter. Upon such sale, the interest of the Charitable Beneficiary in the shares sold shall terminate and the Trustee shall distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the Prohibited Owner and to the Charitable Beneficiary as follows: the Prohibited Owner shall receive the lesser of (i) the price paid by the Prohibited Owner for the shares or, if the Prohibited Owner did not give value for the shares in connection with the event causing the shares to be held in the Charitable Trust (e.g., in the case of a gift, devise or other such transaction), the Market Price (as defined in the Charter) of such shares on the day of the event causing the shares to be held in the Charitable Trust and (ii) the price per share received by the Trustee from the sale or other disposition of the shares held in the Charitable Trust. Any net sale proceeds in excess of the amount payable to the Prohibited Owner shall be paid immediately to the Charitable Beneficiary. If, prior to our discovery that shares of stock have been transferred to the Charitable Trust, such shares are sold by a Prohibited Owner, then (i) such shares shall be deemed to have been sold on behalf of the Charitable Trust and (ii) to the extent that the Prohibited Owner received an amount for such shares that exceeds the amount that such Prohibited Owner was entitled to receive pursuant to the aforementioned requirement, such excess shall be paid to the Trustee upon demand. 
 In addition, shares of stock held in the Charitable Trust shall be deemed to have been offered for sale to us, or our designee, at a price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that resulted in such transfer to the Charitable Trust (or, in the case of a devise or gift, the Market Price at the time of such devise or gift) and (ii) the Market Price on the date we, or our designee, accepts such offer. We shall have the right to accept such offer until the Trustee has sold the shares of stock held in the Charitable Trust. Upon such a sale to us, the interest of the Charitable Beneficiary in the shares sold shall terminate and the Trustee shall distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the Prohibited Owner and any dividends or other distributions held by the Trustee shall be paid to the Charitable Beneficiary. 
 All certificates representing Sotherly s shares of stock will bear a legend referring to the restrictions described above. 
 Every owner of 5.0 or more (or such lower percentages as required by the Code or the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder) of all classes or series of Sotherly s shares of stock, including common stock, within 30 days after the end of each taxable year, is required to give written notice to the Company stating the name and address of such owner, the number of shares of each class and series of shares of stock which the owner beneficially owns and a description of the manner in which such shares are held. Each such owner shall 
 3 

provide to the Company such additional information as the Company may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of such beneficial ownership on Sotherly s status as a REIT and to ensure compliance with the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit, the Common Stock Ownership Limit, and the Preferred Stock Ownership Limit. In addition, each stockholder shall upon demand be required to provide to the Company such information as it may request, in good faith, in order to determine Sotherly s status as a REIT and to comply with the requirements of any taxing authority or governmental authority or to determine such compliance and to ensure compliance with the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit, the Common Stock Ownership Limit, and the Preferred Stock Ownership Limit. 
 These ownership limitations could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of Sotherly s stockholders. 
 Power to Increase Authorized Shares . 
 As permitted by the MGCL, the Charter authorizes the board of directors, without any action by the Company s stockholders, to amend the Charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that the Company has authority to issue. These actions can be taken without stockholder approval, unless stockholder approval is required by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which the Company s securities may be listed or traded. Although we have no current intention of doing so, we could issue a class or series of stock that could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for holders of common stock or otherwise be in their best interest. 
 Power to Reclassify Stock . 
 The Company s Charter authorizes the board of directors, subject to the Articles Supplementary, to classify any unissued preferred stock, and to reclassify any previously classified but unissued common stock and preferred stock of any series from time to time in one or more classes or series, as authorized by the board of directors. 
 Shares of the Company s preferred stock may be issued from time to time, in one or more series (including additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock), as authorized by the Company s board of directors, subject to the Articles Supplementary. Prior to the issuance of any preferred stock, the board of directors is required by Maryland law and the Charter to designate the class or series of preferred stock to distinguish it from all other classes and series of shares, specify the number of shares to be included in the class or series, and set the terms, preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption for each such class or series and cause the Company to file articles supplementary with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland.

Exhibit 4.4 
 Common Stock 
 All of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock are duly authorized, fully paid and nonassessable. 
 Subject to the provisions of the Company s Charter regarding the restrictions on the transfer and ownership of shares of common stock, each outstanding share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors, and, except for the rights that may be held by the holders of shares of the Preferred Stock and as may be provided with respect to any other subsequently issued class or series of common or preferred stock, the holders of such common stock possess the exclusive voting power. There is no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which means that the holders of a majority of the outstanding common stock, voting as a single class, can elect all of the directors and the holders of the remaining stock are not able to elect any directors. 
 Holders of the Company s common stock are entitled to receive distributions when authorized by the board of directors and declared by the Company out of assets legally available for the payment of distributions. They also are entitled to share ratably in the assets legally available for distribution to the Company s stockholders in the event of the Company s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, after payment of or adequate provision for all of the Company s known now or hereafter incurred debts and liabilities. These rights are subject to the preferential rights of any other class or series of the Company s stock, including the holders of the Preferred Stock, and to the provisions of the Charter and the Articles Supplementary regarding restrictions on transfer of its stock. Holders of the Company s common stock have no preference, conversion, exchange, sinking fund, redemption or appraisal rights and have no preemptive rights to subscribe for any of our securities. Subject to the restrictions on transfer of stock contained in the Charter, all shares of the Company s common stock will have equal distribution, liquidation and other rights. 
 The Charter provides that holders of our common stock generally have no appraisal rights unless our board of directors determines prospectively that appraisal rights will apply to one or more transactions in which holders of our common stock would otherwise be entitled to exercise appraisal rights. 
 Under the MGCL, a Maryland corporation generally cannot dissolve, amend its charter, merge, consolidate, convert, sell all or substantially all of its assets or engage in a statutory share exchange unless declared advisable by its board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter unless a lesser percentage (but not less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter) is set forth in the corporation s charter. Our Charter provides for approval of any of these matters by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on such matters, except that the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors is required to remove a director (and such removal must be for cause) and the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on such matter is required to amend the provisions of our Charter relating to the removal of directors, the restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock and the vote required to amend such provisions. Maryland law also permits a Maryland corporation to transfer all or substantially all of its assets without the approval of the stockholders of the corporation to an entity if all of the equity interests of the entity are owned, directly or indirectly, by the corporation. Because our operating assets may be held by our operating partnership or its subsidiaries, these subsidiaries may be able to merge or transfer all or substantially all of their assets to the operating partnership or other subsidiary without the approval of our stockholders. 

Exhibit 4.4 
 Preferred Stock 
 Series B Preferred Stock 
 Ranking . The Series B Preferred Stock ranks, with respect to distribution rights and rights upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, senior to all classes or series of our common stock and to any other class or series of our capital stock which is expressly designated as ranking junior to the Series B Preferred Stock (collectively, Series B Junior Stock ), on parity with any class of our capital stock which is expressly designated as ranking on parity with the Series B Preferred Stock (collectively, Series B Parity Stock ), including our Series C Preferred Stock and our Series D Preferred Stock, junior to any other class or series of our capital stock that we may later authorize or issue which is designated as ranking senior to the Series B Preferred Stock, and junior to our existing and future indebtedness. Any future authorization or issuance of a class or series of our capital stock expressly designated as ranking senior to the Series B Preferred Stock will require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and all other shares of any class or series ranking on parity with the Series B Preferred Stock that are entitled to similar voting rights, including our Series C Preferred Stock and our Series D Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class). 
 Distributions . Subject to the preferential rights of any security senior to the Series B Preferred Stock as to distributions, the holders of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if authorized by our board of directors and declared by us out of funds legally available for the payment of distributions, cumulative cash distributions at the rate of 8.0 per annum of the 25.00 liquidation preference per share of the Series B Preferred Stock (equivalent to an annual rate of 2.00 per share of the Series B Preferred Stock). Distributions are payable quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of each January, April, July and October of each year (or if not a business day, on the next succeeding business day). Distributions payable on the Series B Preferred Stock for any partial or longer period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Accrued but unpaid distributions on the Series B Preferred Stock will accumulate as of the distribution payment date on which they first became payable. Distributions on the Series B Preferred Stock will accrue whether or not: 
 we have earnings; 

there are funds legally available for the payment of those distributions; or 

those distributions are authorized or declared. 

Except as described in the next paragraph, unless full cumulative distributions on the Series B Preferred Stock for all past distribution periods shall have been, or contemporaneously are, declared and paid in cash or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof in cash is set aside for payment, we will not: 
 declare or pay or set aside for payment of distributions, and we will not declare or make any distribution of cash or other property, directly or indirectly, on or with respect to any shares of our common stock, or any other class or series of Series B Parity Stock or Series B Junior Stock for any period; or 

redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire for any consideration, or make any other distribution of cash or other property, directly or indirectly, on or with respect to, or pay or make available any monies for a sinking fund for the redemption of, any common stock, or any other class or series of Series B Parity Stock or Series B Junior Stock. 

The foregoing sentence, however, will not prohibit: 
 distributions payable solely in shares of our common stock or shares of Series B Junior Stock; 

the conversion into or exchange for other shares of any class or series of Series B Junior Stock; and 

our purchase of Series B Preferred Stock, Series B Parity Stock or Series B Junior Stock pursuant to our Charter to the extent necessary to preserve our status as a REIT. 

Optional Redemption . We may, at our option, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days written notice, redeem the Series B Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, for cash at a redemption price of 25.00 per share of Series B Preferred Stock, plus all accrued and unpaid distributions (whether or not declared) up to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption, without interest, to the extent we have funds legally available for that purpose. Unless full cumulative distributions on all outstanding Series B Preferred Stock shall have been or contemporaneously are authorized, declared and paid in cash or declared and a sufficient sum set aside for payment of all past distribution periods and the then-current distribution period, no shares of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be redeemed unless all outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock are simultaneously redeemed.

 If the Company has (i) given a notice of redemption, (ii) set aside sufficient funds for the redemption in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock called for redemption and (iii) given irrevocable instructions to pay the redemption price and all accrued and unpaid distributions, then from and after the redemption date, those shares of Series B Preferred Stock will be treated as no longer being outstanding, no further distributions will accrue and all other rights of the holders of those shares of Series B Preferred Stock will terminate (including, with respect to such shares of Series B Preferred Stock called for redemption, the conversion rights described below under Conversion Rights ), except the right to receive the redemption price plus any accrued and unpaid distributions payable upon such redemption, without interest. The holders of those shares of Series B Preferred Stock will retain their right to receive the redemption price for their shares and any accrued and unpaid distributions payable upon such redemption, without interest. 
 The holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock at the close of business on a distribution record date will be entitled to receive the distribution payable with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock on the corresponding payment date notwithstanding the redemption of the Series B Preferred Stock between such record date and the corresponding payment date. 
 Special Optional Redemption . Upon the occurrence of a Series B Change of Control (as defined below), we may, at our option, redeem the Series B Preferred Stock, in whole or in part within 120 days after the first date on which such Series B Change of Control occurred, by paying 25.00 per share of Series B Preferred Stock, plus any accrued and unpaid distributions to, but not including, the date of redemption.

 A notice of redemption is required to be mailed to the record holders of shares of our Series B Preferred Stock no less than 30 days nor more than 60 days before the redemption date. A failure to give notice of redemption or any defect in the notice or in its mailing will not affect the validity of the redemption of any Series B Preferred Stock except as to the holder to whom notice was defective. Each notice will state the following: 
 the redemption date; 

the redemption price; 

the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed; 

the place or places where the certificates for the shares of the Series B Preferred Stock, if any, are to be surrendered for payment; 

the procedures for surrendering non-certificated shares of Series B Preferred Stock, to the extent the shares of Series B Preferred Stock are uncertificated, for payment of the redemption price; 

that distributions on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed will cease to accumulate on such redemption date; 

7 

that payment of the redemption price and any accumulated and unpaid distributions will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Series B Preferred Stock; and 

that the holders of the shares of our Series B Preferred Stock to which the notice relates will not be able to tender such shares of Series B Preferred Stock for conversion in connection with the Series B Change of Control and each share of Series B Preferred Stock tendered for conversion that is selected, prior to the relevant Change of Control Conversion Date, for redemption will be redeemed on the related date of redemption instead of converted on the relevant Change of Control Conversion Date. 

If the Company has (i) given a notice of redemption, (ii) set aside sufficient funds for the redemption in trust for the benefit of the holders of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock called for redemption and (iii) given irrevocable instructions to pay the redemption price and all accrued and unpaid distributions, then from and after the redemption date, those shares of Series B Preferred Stock will be treated as no longer being outstanding, no further distributions will accrue and all other rights of the holders of those shares of Series B Preferred Stock will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price plus any accrued and unpaid distributions payable upon such redemption, without interest. The holders of those shares of Series B Preferred Stock will retain their right to receive the redemption price for their shares and any accrued and unpaid distributions payable upon such redemption, without interest. 
 The holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock at the close of business on a distribution record date will be entitled to receive the distribution payable with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock on the corresponding payment date notwithstanding the redemption of the Series B Preferred Stock between such record date and the corresponding payment date. 
 A Series B Change of Contro l is when, after the original issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock, the following have occurred and are continuing: 
 the acquisition by any person, including any syndicate or group deemed to be a person under Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, of beneficial ownership, directly or indirectly, through a purchase, merger or other acquisition transaction or series of purchases, mergers or other acquisition transactions of shares of our company entitling that person to exercise more than 50 of the total voting power of all shares of our company entitled to vote generally in elections of directors (except that such person will be deemed to have beneficial ownership of all securities that such person has the right to acquire, whether such right is currently exercisable or is exercisable only upon the occurrence of a subsequent condition); and 

following the closing of any transaction referred to in the bullet point above, neither we nor the acquiring or surviving entity has a class of common securities (or ADRs representing such securities) listed on the NYSE, the NYSE MKT or NASDAQ or listed or quoted on an exchange or quotation system that is a successor to the NYSE, the NYSE MKT or NASDAQ. 

Conversion Rights . Upon the occurrence of a Series B Change of Control, each holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock will have the right, unless, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, the Company has provided or provides notice of its election to redeem the shares of Series B Preferred Stock as described under Optional Redemption or Special Optional Redemption, to convert some or all of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by such holder (the Change of Control Series B Conversion Right on the applicable Change of Control Conversion Date into a number of shares of common stock per share of Series B Preferred Stock (the Series B Conversion Consideration equal to the lesser of: 
 the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the sum of the 25.00 liquidation preference per share of the Series B Preferred Stock to be converted plus the amount of any accrued and unpaid distributions to, but not including, the relevant Change of Control Conversion Date (unless such Change of Control Conversion Date is after a record date for a Series B Preferred Stock distribution payment and prior to the corresponding Series B Preferred Stock distribution payment date, in which case no additional amount for such accrued and unpaid distribution will be included in this sum) by (ii) the Series B Common Stock Price (as defined below); and

8.29187(the Series B Share Cap subject to adjustments, as described below. 

The Series B Share Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any share splits (including those effected pursuant to a common stock distribution), subdivisions or combinations (in each case, a Series B Share Split with respect to shares of our common stock as follows: the adjusted Series B Share Cap as the result of a Series B Share Split will be the number of shares of our common stock that is equivalent to the product of (i) the Series B Share Cap in effect immediately prior to such Series B Share Split multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of our common stock outstanding after giving effect to such Series B Share Split and the denominator of which is the number of shares of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to such Series B Share Split. 
 For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, the aggregate number of shares of our common stock (or equivalent Alternative Series B Conversion Consideration (as defined below), as applicable) issuable in connection with the exercise of the Change of Control Series B Conversion Right will not exceed 13,349,910 shares of common stock (or equivalent Alternative Series B Conversion Consideration, as applicable), subject to increase on a pro rata basis if we issue additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock (the Series B Exchange Cap ). The Series B Exchange Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any Series B Share Splits on the same basis as the corresponding adjustment to the Series B Share Cap. 
 In the case of a Series B Change of Control pursuant to which shares of our common stock will be converted into cash, securities or other property or assets (including any combination thereof) (the Alternative Series B Form Consideration ), a holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock will receive upon conversion of such Series B Preferred Stock the kind and amount of Alternative Series B Form Consideration which such holder would have owned or been entitled to receive upon the Series B Change of Control had such holder held a number of shares of our common stock equal to the Series B Conversion Consideration immediately prior to the effective time of the Series B Change of Control (the Alternative Series B Conversion Consideration , and the Series B Conversion Consideration or the Alternative Series B Conversion Consideration, as may be applicable to a Series B Change of Control, is referred to as the Series B Conversion Consideration ). 
 If the holders of shares of our common stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in the Series B Change of Control, the consideration that the holders of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock will receive will be the form of consideration elected by the holders of the shares of common stock who participate in the determination (based on the weighted average of elections) and will be subject to any limitations to which all holders of shares of common stock are subject, including, without limitation, pro rata reductions applicable to any portion of the consideration payable in the Series B Change of Control. 
 No fractional shares of the Company s common stock will be issued upon the conversion of our Series B Preferred Stock. Instead, we will pay the cash value of such fractional shares. 
 Within 15 days following the occurrence of a Series B Change of Control, the Company is required to provide to holders of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock a notice of the occurrence of the Series B Change of Control that describes the resulting Change of Control Series B Conversion Right.

The conversion notice must state: 
 the relevant Change of Control Conversion Date; 

the number of Series B Preferred Stock to be converted; and 

that the Series B Preferred Stock is to be converted pursuant to the applicable terms of the Series B Preferred Stock. 

The Change of Control Conversion Date will be a business day that is no less than 20 days nor more than 35 days after the date on which we provide the notice described herein to the holders of shares of the Preferred Stock of the relevant series. 
 The Series B Common Stock Price will be (i) if the consideration to be received in the Series B Change of Control by holders of shares of our common stock is solely cash, the amount of cash consideration per share of common stock, or (ii) if the consideration to be received in the Series B Change of Control by holders of shares of our common stock is other than solely cash, the average of the closing price per share of common stock on the 10 consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the effective date of the Series B Change of Control. 
 Holders of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock may withdraw any notice of exercise of a Change of Control Series B Conversion Right (in whole or in part) by a written notice of withdrawal delivered to our transfer agent prior to the close of business on the business day prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date. The notice of withdrawal must state: 
 the number of withdrawn shares of Series B Preferred Stock;

 Series B Preferred Stock as to which the Change of Control Series B Conversion Right has been properly exercised and for which the conversion notice has not been properly withdrawn will be converted into the applicable Series B Conversion Consideration in accordance with the Change of Control Series C Conversion Right on the applicable Change of Control Conversion Date, unless prior to such Change of Control Conversion Date the Company has provided or provides notice of its election to redeem such Series B Preferred Stock, whether pursuant to the Company s optional redemption right or its special optional redemption right. If the Company elects to redeem Series B Preferred Stock that would otherwise be converted into the applicable Series 
 10 

B Conversion Consideration on a Change of Control Conversion Date, such Series B Preferred Stock will not be so converted and the holders of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive on the applicable redemption date 25.00 per share of Series B Preferred Stock, plus any accrued and unpaid distribution thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. 
 The Company is required to deliver amounts owing upon conversion no later than the third business day following the applicable Change of Control Conversion Date. 
 Notwithstanding any other provision of our Series B Preferred Stock, no holder of shares of our Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to convert such shares Series B Preferred Stock for shares of our common stock to the extent that receipt of such shares of common stock would cause such holder (or any other person) to exceed the share ownership limits contained in our Charter, including the Articles Supplementary. See Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer above. 
 Except as provided above in connection with a Series B Change of Control, shares of Series B Preferred Stock are not convertible into or exchangeable for any other securities or property. 
 Liquidation Preference . Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, and before any distribution or payment shall be made to holders of our common stock or any other class or series of Series B Junior Stock, the holders of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to be paid out of our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders, after payment or provision for our debts and other liabilities, payments to holders of senior securities, if any, a liquidation preference of 25.00 per share of Series B Preferred Stock, plus an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid distributions (whether or not earned or declared) up to, but not including, the date of payment or the date the amount of payment is set aside. The rights of holders of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock to receive their liquidation preference will be subject to the proportionate rights of holders of our Series C Preferred Stock, our Series D Preferred Stock and any other class or series of Series B Parity Stock. After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distributions to which they are entitled, the holders of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock will have no right or claim to any of our remaining assets. Our consolidation, conversion or merger with or into any other corporation, trust or other entity, or the voluntary sale, lease, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of our property or business, will not be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs. 
 No Maturity, Sinking Fund or Mandatory Redemption . The Series B Preferred Stock has no maturity date and we are not required to redeem shares of the Series B Preferred Stock at any time. Accordingly, the Series B Preferred Stock will remain outstanding indefinitely, unless we decide, at our option, to exercise our redemption right, or under circumstances where holders of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock have a conversion right, the holders of shares of the Series B Preferred Share Stock decide to convert them. The Series B Preferred Stock is not subject to any sinking fund. 
 Voting Rights . Holders of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock have no voting rights, except as set forth below. 
 If distributions on the Series B Preferred Stock are in arrears for six or more quarterly periods, whether or not consecutive, holders of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class with holders of our Series C Preferred Stock, our Series D Preferred Stock and all other classes or series of Series B Parity Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) will be entitled to vote at a special meeting or at our next annual meeting of stockholders and each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders, for the election of two additional directors to serve on our board of directors (which we refer to as a preferred stock director), until all unpaid distributions and the distribution for the then current period with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock and any other class or series of Series B Parity Stock have been fully paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for payment. In such a case, the number of directors serving on the board of directors will be increased by two members. The preferred stock directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in the election to serve until our next annual meeting and until their successors are duly elected and qualified or until such directors right to hold the office terminates pursuant to the Series B Termination Event (as defined below), whichever occurs earlier. 
 11 

If and when all accumulated distributions and the distribution for the current distribution period on the Series B Preferred Stock and for all classes and series of Series B Parity Stock and upon which similar voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable shall have been paid in full or a sum sufficient for such payment is irrevocably deposited in trust for payment, the holders of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be immediately divested of the voting rights set forth above (subject to revesting in the event of each and every preferred distribution default) and, if all distributions in arrears and the distributions for the current distribution period have been paid in full or set aside for payment in full on all other classes or series of Series B Parity Stock, the term and office of such preferred stock directors so elected will terminate immediately and the entire board of directors will be reduced accordingly (the Series B Termination Event ). 
 In addition, so long as any shares of Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding, we will not, without the consent or the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and each other class or series of Series B Parity Stock with respect to the payment of distributions or the distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up upon which similar voting rights have been conferred, voting as a single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting: 
 authorize, create or issue, or increase the authorized or issued amount of, any class or series of stock ranking senior to the Series B Preferred Stock with respect to payment of distributions, or the distribution of assets upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, or reclassify any of our authorized stock into any such stock, or create, authorize or issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase any such stock; or 

amend, alter or repeal the provisions of our Charter or the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, whether by merger, consolidation, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of our assets or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the Series B Preferred Stock or the holders thereof; 

except that with respect to the occurrence of any of the events described in the second bullet point immediately above, so long as shares of the Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding with the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock materially unchanged or the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock receive capital stock of the successor with substantially identical rights (taken as a whole), taking into account that, upon the occurrence of an event described in the second bullet point above, we may not be the surviving entity, the occurrence of such event will not be deemed to materially and adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting power of holders of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock, and in such case such holders shall not have any voting rights with respect to the events described in the second bullet point immediately above. 

Furthermore, if the holders of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock receive the greater of the full trading price of the Series B Preferred Stock on the date of an event described in the second bullet point immediately above or the 25.00 liquidation preference per share of Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events described in the second bullet point immediately above, then such holders shall not have any voting rights with respect to the events described in the second bullet point immediately above. If any event described in the second bullet point above would materially and adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series B Preferred Stock disproportionately relative to other classes or series of Series B Parity Stock with respect to the payment of distributions and the distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock voting separately as a class, will also be required. 
 Information Rights . During any period in which we are not subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and any shares of Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Company is required (i) to transmit by mail or other permissible means under the Exchange Act to all holders of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock as their names and addresses appear in our record books and without cost to such holders, copies of the Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q that we would have been required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act if we were subject thereto (other than any 
 12 

exhibits that would have been required) and (ii) within 15 days following written request, to supply copies of such reports to any prospective holder of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock. The Company is required to mail (or otherwise provide) the reports to the holders of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock within 15 days after the respective dates by which we would have been required to file such reports with the SEC if we were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. 
 Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer. For information regarding restrictions on ownership and transfer of the Series B Preferred Shares, see All Classes of Our Capital Stock above. 
 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Series B Preferred Shares, no holder of the Series B Preferred Shares will be entitled to convert any Series B Preferred Shares into our common shares to the extent that receipt of our common shares would cause such holder or any other person to exceed the ownership limits contained in our declaration of trust. 
 Series C Preferred Stock 
 Ranking . The Series C Preferred Stock ranks, with respect to distribution rights and rights upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, senior to all classes or series of our common stock and to any other class or series of our capital stock which is expressly designated as ranking junior to the Series C Preferred Stock (collectively, Series C Junior Stock ), on parity with any class of our capital stock which is expressly designated as ranking on parity with the Series C Preferred Stock (collectively, Series C Parity Stock ), including our Series B Preferred Stock and our Series D Preferred Stock, junior to any other class or series of our capital stock that we may later authorize or issue which is designated as ranking senior to the Series C Preferred Stock, and junior to our existing and future indebtedness. Any future authorization or issuance of a class or series of our capital stock expressly designated as ranking senior to the Series C Preferred Stock will require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock and all other shares of any class or series ranking on parity with the Series C Preferred Stock that are entitled to similar voting rights, including our Series B Preferred Stock and our Series D Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class). 
 Distributions . Subject to the preferential rights of any security senior to the Series C Preferred Stock as to distributions, the holders of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if authorized by our board of directors and declared by us out of funds legally available for the payment of distributions, cumulative cash distributions at the rate of 7.875 per annum of the 25.00 liquidation preference per share of the Series C Preferred Stock (equivalent to an annual rate of 1.96875 per share of the Series C Preferred Stock). Distributions are payable quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of January, April, July and October of each year (or if not a business day, on the next succeeding business day). Distributions payable on the Series C Preferred Stock for any partial or longer period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Accrued but unpaid distributions on the Series C Preferred Stock will accumulate as of the distribution payment date on which they first became payable. Distributions on the Series C Preferred Stock will accrue whether or not: 
 we have earnings; 

there are funds legally available for the payment of those distributions; or 

those distributions are authorized or declared. 

Except as described in the next paragraph, unless full cumulative distributions on the Series C Preferred Stock for all past distribution periods shall have been, or contemporaneously are, declared and paid in cash or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof in cash is set aside for payment, we will not: 
 declare or pay or set aside for payment of distributions, and we will not declare or make any distribution of cash or other property, directly or indirectly, on or with respect to any shares of our common stock, or any other class or series of Series C Parity Stock or Series C Junior Stock for any period; or 

13 

redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire for any consideration, or make any other distribution of cash or other property, directly or indirectly, on or with respect to, or pay or make available any monies for a sinking fund for the redemption of, any common stock, or any other class or series of Series C Parity Stock or Series C Junior Stock. 

The foregoing sentence, however, will not prohibit: 
 distributions payable solely in shares of our common stock or shares of Series C Junior Stock; 

the conversion into or exchange for other shares of any class or series of Series C Junior Stock; and 

our purchase of Series C Preferred Stock, Series C Parity Stock or Series C Junior Stock pursuant to our Charter to the extent necessary to preserve our status as a REIT. 

Optional Redemption . We may, at our option, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days written notice, redeem the Series C Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, for cash at a redemption price of 25.00 per share of Series C Preferred Stock, plus all accrued and unpaid distributions (whether or not declared) up to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption, without interest, to the extent we have funds legally available for that purpose. Unless full cumulative distributions on all outstanding Series C Preferred Stock shall have been or contemporaneously are authorized, declared and paid in cash or declared and a sufficient sum set aside for payment of all past distribution periods and the then-current distribution period, no shares of the Series C Preferred Stock shall be redeemed unless all outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred Stock are simultaneously redeemed. All shares of Series C Preferred Stock that we redeem or repurchase will be retired and restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock, without designation as to series or class. 
 If the Company has (i) given a notice of redemption, (ii) set aside sufficient funds for the redemption in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock called for redemption and (iii) given irrevocable instructions to pay the redemption price and all accrued and unpaid distributions, then from and after the redemption date, those shares of Series C Preferred Stock will be treated as no longer being outstanding, no further distributions will accrue and all other rights of the holders of those shares of Series C Preferred Stock will terminate (including, with respect to such shares of Series C Preferred Stock called for redemption, the conversion rights described below under Conversion Rights ), except the right to receive the redemption price plus any accrued and unpaid distributions payable upon such redemption, without interest. The holders of those shares of Series C Preferred Stock will retain their right to receive the redemption price for their shares and any accrued and unpaid distributions payable upon such redemption, without interest. 
 The holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock at the close of business on a distribution record date will be entitled to receive the distribution payable with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock on the corresponding payment date notwithstanding the redemption of the Series C Preferred Stock between such record date and the corresponding payment date. 
 Special Optional Redemption . Upon the occurrence of a Series C Change of Control (as defined below), we may, at our option, redeem the Series C Preferred Stock, in whole or in part within 120 days after the first date on which such Series C Change of Control occurred, by paying 25.00 per share of Series C Preferred Stock, plus any accrued and unpaid distributions to, but not including, the date of redemption. If, prior to the relevant Change of Control Conversion Date, we have provided or provide notice of redemption with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock (whether pursuant to our optional redemption right or our special optional redemption right), a holder of Series C Preferred Stock will not have the conversion right described below under Conversion Rights, in respect of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock called for redemption. 
 A notice of redemption is required to be mailed to the record holders of shares of our Series C Preferred Stock no less than 30 days nor more than 60 days before the redemption date. A failure to give notice of redemption or any defect in the notice or in its mailing will not affect the validity of the redemption of any Series C Preferred Stock except as to the holder to whom notice was defective. Each notice will state the following: 
 14 

the redemption date; 

the redemption price; 

the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed; 

the place or places where the certificates for the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, if any, are to be surrendered for payment; 

the procedures for surrendering non-certificated shares of Series C Preferred Stock, to the extent the shares of Series C Preferred Stock are uncertificated, for payment of the redemption price; 

that distributions on the shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed will cease to accumulate on such redemption date; 

that payment of the redemption price and any accumulated and unpaid distributions will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Series C Preferred Stock; and 

that the holders of the shares of our Series C Preferred Stock to which the notice relates will not be able to tender such shares of Series C Preferred Stock for conversion in connection with the Series B Change of Control and each share of Series C Preferred Stock tendered for conversion that is selected, prior to the relevant Change of Control Conversion Date, for redemption will be redeemed on the related date of redemption instead of converted on the relevant Change of Control Conversion Date. 

If the Company has (i) given a notice of redemption, (ii) set aside sufficient funds for the redemption in trust for the benefit of the holders of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock called for redemption and (iii) given irrevocable instructions to pay the redemption price and all accrued and unpaid distributions, then from and after the redemption date, those shares of Series C Preferred Stock will be treated as no longer being outstanding, no further distributions will accrue and all other rights of the holders of those shares of Series C Preferred Stock will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price plus any accrued and unpaid distributions payable upon such redemption, without interest. The holders of those shares of Series C Preferred Stock will retain their right to receive the redemption price for their shares and any accrued and unpaid distributions payable upon such redemption, without interest. 
 The holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock at the close of business on a distribution record date will be entitled to receive the distribution payable with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock on the corresponding payment date notwithstanding the redemption of the Series C Preferred Stock between such record date and the corresponding payment date. 
 A Series C Change of Control is when, after the original issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock, the following have occurred and are continuing: 
 the acquisition by any person, including any syndicate or group deemed to be a person under Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, of beneficial ownership, directly or indirectly, through a purchase, merger or other acquisition transaction or series of purchases, mergers or other acquisition transactions of shares of our company entitling that person to exercise more than 50 of the total voting power of all shares of our company entitled to vote generally in elections of directors (except that such person will be deemed to have beneficial ownership of all securities that such person has the right to acquire, whether such right is currently exercisable or is exercisable only upon the occurrence of a subsequent condition); and 

following the closing of any transaction referred to in the bullet point above, neither we nor the acquiring or surviving entity has a class of common securities (or ADRs representing such securities) listed on the NYSE, the NYSE American or NASDAQ or listed or quoted on an exchange or quotation system that is a successor to the NYSE, the NYSE American or NASDAQ. 

Conversion Rights . Upon the occurrence of a Series C Change of Control, each holder of shares of Series C Preferred Stock will have the right, unless, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, the Company has

provided or provides notice of its election to redeem the shares of Series C Preferred Stock as described under Optional Redemption or Special Optional Redemption, to convert some or all of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock held by such holder (the Change of Control Series C Conversion Right on the applicable Change of Control Conversion Date into a number of shares of common stock per share of Series C Preferred Stock (the Series C Conversion Consideration equal to the lesser of: 
 the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the sum of the 25.00 liquidation preference per share of the Series C Preferred Stock to be converted plus the amount of any accrued and unpaid distributions to, but not including, the relevant Change of Control Conversion Date (unless such Change of Control Conversion Date is after a record date for a Series C Preferred Stock distribution payment and prior to the corresponding Series C Preferred Stock distribution payment date, in which case no additional amount for such accrued and unpaid distribution will be included in this sum) by (ii) the Series C Common Stock Price (as defined below); and 

8.50340 (the Series C Share Cap ), subject to adjustments, as described below. 

The Series C Share Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any share splits (including those effected pursuant to a common stock distribution), subdivisions or combinations (in each case, a Series C Share Split with respect to shares of our common stock as follows: the adjusted Series C Share Cap as the result of a Series C Share Split will be the number of shares of our common stock that is equivalent to the product of (i) the Series C Share Cap in effect immediately prior to such Series C Share Split multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of our common stock outstanding after giving effect to such Series C Share Split and the denominator of which is the number of shares of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to such Series C Share Split. 
 For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, the aggregate number of shares of our common stock (or equivalent Alternative Series C Conversion Consideration (as defined below), as applicable) issuable in connection with the exercise of the Change of Control Series C Conversion Right will not exceed 14,455,780 shares of common stock (or equivalent Alternative Series C Conversion Consideration, as applicable), subject to increase on a pro rata basis if we issue additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock (the Series C Exchange Cap ). The Series C Exchange Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any Series C Share Splits on the same basis as the corresponding adjustment to the Series C Share Cap. 
 In the case of a Series C Change of Control pursuant to which shares of our common stock will be converted into cash, securities or other property or assets (including any combination thereof) (the Alternative Series C Form Consideration ), a holder of shares of Series C Preferred Stock will receive upon conversion of such Series C Preferred Stock the kind and amount of Alternative Series C Form Consideration which such holder would have owned or been entitled to receive upon the Series C Change of Control had such holder held a number of shares of our common stock equal to the Series C Conversion Consideration immediately prior to the effective time of the Series C Change of Control (the Alternative Series C Conversion Consideration , and the Series C Conversion Consideration or the Alternative Series C Conversion Consideration, as may be applicable to a Series C Change of Control, is referred to as the Series C Conversion Consideration ). 
 If the holders of shares of our common stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in the Series C Change of Control, the consideration that the holders of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock will receive will be the form of consideration elected by the holders of the shares of common stock who participate in the determination (based on the weighted average of elections) and will be subject to any limitations to which all holders of shares of common stock are subject, including, without limitation, pro rata reductions applicable to any portion of the consideration payable in the Series C Change of Control. 
 No fractional shares of the Company s common stock will be issued upon the conversion of our Series C Preferred Stock. Instead, we will pay the cash value of such fractional shares. 
 16 

Within 15 days following the occurrence of a Series C Change of Control, the Company is required to provide to holders of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock a notice of the occurrence of the Series C Change of Control that describes the resulting Change of Control Series C Conversion Right.

that if, prior to the applicable Change of Control Conversion Date, the Company has provided or provides notice of its election to redeem all or any portion of the Series C Preferred Stock, holders of the Series C Preferred Stock will not be able to convert such shares of Series C Preferred Stock called for redemption and such Series C Preferred Stock will be redeemed on the related redemption date, even if they have already been tendered for conversion pursuant to the Change of Control Series C Conversion Right; 

if applicable, the type and amount of Alternative Series C Conversion Consideration entitled to be received per share of Series C Preferred Stock; 

the name and address of the paying agent and the conversion agent; and

the number of Series C Preferred Stock to be converted; and 

that the Series C Preferred Stock is to be converted pursuant to the applicable terms of the Series C Preferred Stock. 

The Series C Common Stock Price will be (i) if the consideration to be received in the Series C Change of Control by holders of shares of our common stock is solely cash, the amount of cash consideration per share of common stock, or (ii) if the consideration to be received in the Series C Change of Control by holders of shares of our common stock is other than solely cash, the average of the closing price per share of common stock on the 10 consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the effective date of the Series C Change of Control. 
 Holders of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock may withdraw any notice of exercise of a Change of Control Series C Conversion Right (in whole or in part) by a written notice of withdrawal delivered to our transfer agent prior to the close of business on the business day prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date. The notice of withdrawal must state: 
 the number of withdrawn shares of Series C Preferred Stock; 

if certificated shares of Series C Preferred Stock have been issued, the certificate numbers of the withdrawn shares of Series C Preferred Stock; and

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Series C Preferred Stock is held in global form, the conversion notice and/or the notice of withdrawal, as applicable, must comply with applicable procedures of The Depository Trust Company. 
 Series C Preferred Stock as to which the Change of Control Series C Conversion Right has been properly exercised and for which the conversion notice has not been properly withdrawn will be converted into the applicable Series C Conversion Consideration in accordance with the Change of Control Series C Conversion Right on the applicable Change of Control Conversion Date, unless prior to such Change of Control Conversion Date the Company has provided or provides notice of its election to redeem such Series C Preferred Stock, whether pursuant to the Company s optional redemption right or its special optional redemption right. If the Company elects to redeem Series C Preferred Stock that would otherwise be converted into the applicable Series C Conversion Consideration on a Change of Control Conversion Date, such Series C Preferred Stock will not be so converted and the holders of such shares of Series C Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive on the applicable redemption date 25.00 per share of Series C Preferred Stock, plus any accrued and unpaid distribution thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. 
 The Company is required to deliver amounts owing upon conversion no later than the third business day following the applicable Change of Control Conversion Date. 
 Notwithstanding any other provision of our Series C Preferred Stock, no holder of shares of our Series C Preferred Stock will be entitled to convert such shares Series C Preferred Stock for shares of our common stock to the extent that receipt of such shares of common stock would cause such holder (or any other person) to exceed the share ownership limits contained in our Charter, including the Articles Supplementary. See Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer above. 
 Except as provided above in connection with a Series C Change of Control, shares of Series C Preferred Stock are not convertible into or exchangeable for any other securities or property. 
 Liquidation Preference . Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, and before any distribution or payment shall be made to holders of our common stock or any other class or series of Series C Junior Stock, the holders of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to be paid out of our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders, after payment or provision for our debts and other liabilities, payments to holders of senior securities, if any, a liquidation preference of 25.00 per share of Series C Preferred Stock, plus an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid distributions (whether or not earned or declared) up to, but not including, the date of payment or the date the amount of payment is set aside. The rights of holders of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock to receive their liquidation preference will be subject to the proportionate rights of holders of our Series B Preferred Stock, our Series D Preferred Stock and any other class or series of Series C Parity Stock. After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distributions to which they are entitled, the holders of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock will have no right or claim to any of our remaining assets. Our consolidation, conversion or merger with or into any other corporation, trust or other entity, or the voluntary sale, lease, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of our property or business, will not be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs. 
 No Maturity, Sinking Fund or Mandatory Redemption . The Series C Preferred Stock has no maturity date and we are not required to redeem shares of the Series C Preferred Stock at any time. Accordingly, the Series C Preferred Stock will remain outstanding indefinitely, unless we decide, at our option, to exercise our optional redemption right described under Optional Redemption or, upon a Series C Change of Control, we decide, at our option, to exercise our special redemption right described under Special Optional Redemption or holders of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock decide to exercise the conversion right described under Conversion Rights. The Series C Preferred Stock is not subject to any sinking fund. 
 Voting Rights . Holders of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock have no voting rights, except as set forth below. 
 18 

If distributions on the Series C Preferred Stock are in arrears for six or more quarterly periods, whether or not consecutive, holders of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class with holders of our Series B Preferred Stock, our Series D Preferred Stock and all other classes or series of Series C Parity Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) will be entitled to vote at a special meeting or at our next annual meeting of stockholders and each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders, for the election of two additional directors to serve on our board of directors (which we refer to as a preferred stock director), until all unpaid distributions and the distribution for the then current period with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock and any other class or series of Series C Parity Stock have been fully paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for payment. In such a case, the number of directors serving on the board of directors will be increased by two members. The preferred stock directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in the election to serve until our next annual meeting and until their successors are duly elected and qualified or until such directors right to hold the office terminates pursuant to the Series C Termination Event (as defined below), whichever occurs earlier. In no event will the holders of Series C Preferred Stock be entitled to nominate or elect an individual as a director, and no individual will be qualified to be nominated for election or to serve as a director, if the individual s service as a director would cause us to fail to satisfy a requirement relating to director independence of any national securities exchange on which any class or series of our stock is then-listed or otherwise conflict with our Charter or Bylaws. 
 If and when all accumulated distributions and the distribution for the current distribution period on the Series C Preferred Stock and for all classes and series of Series C Parity Stock and upon which similar voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable shall have been paid in full or a sum sufficient for such payment is irrevocably deposited in trust for payment, the holders of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock shall be immediately divested of the voting rights set forth above and, if all distributions in arrears and the distributions for the current distribution period have been paid in full or set aside for payment in full on all other classes or series of Series C Parity Stock, the term and office of such preferred stock directors so elected will terminate immediately and the number of members constituting our board of directors will be reduced accordingly (the Series C Termination Event ). The right of the holders of Series C Preferred Stock to elect the additional directors will again vest if and whenever dividends are in arrears for six additional quarterly periods, whether or not consecutive, as described above. 
 In addition, so long as any shares of Series C Preferred Stock remain outstanding, we will not, without the consent or the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock and each other class or series of Series C Parity Stock with respect to the payment of distributions or the distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up upon which similar voting rights have been conferred, voting as a single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting: 
 authorize, create or issue, or increase the authorized or issued amount of, any class or series of stock ranking senior to the Series C Preferred Stock with respect to payment of distributions, or the distribution of assets upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, or reclassify any of our authorized stock into any such stock, or create, authorize or issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase any such stock; or 

amend, alter or repeal the provisions of our Charter or the terms of the Series C Preferred Stock, whether by merger, consolidation, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of our assets or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the Series C Preferred Stock or the holders thereof; 

except that with respect to the occurrence of any of the events described in the second bullet point immediately above, so long as shares of the Series C Preferred Stock remain outstanding with the terms of the Series C Preferred Stock materially unchanged or the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock receive capital stock of the successor with substantially identical rights (taken as a whole), taking into account that, upon the occurrence of an event described in the second bullet point above, we may not be the surviving entity, the occurrence of such event will not be deemed to materially and adversely affect 

19 

the rights, preferences, privileges or voting power of holders of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, and in such case such holders shall not have any voting rights with respect to the events described in the second bullet point immediately above. 

Furthermore, if the holders of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock receive the greater of the full trading price of the Series C Preferred Stock on the date of an event described in the second bullet point immediately above or the 25.00 liquidation preference per share of Series C Preferred Stock pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events described in the second bullet point immediately above, then such holders shall not have any voting rights with respect to the events described in the second bullet point immediately above. If any event described in the second bullet point above would materially and adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series C Preferred Stock disproportionately relative to other classes or series of Series C Parity Stock with respect to the payment of distributions and the distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock voting separately as a class, will also be required. 
 Information Rights . During any period in which we are not subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Company is required (i) to transmit by mail or other permissible means under the Exchange Act to all holders of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock as their names and addresses appear in our record books and without cost to such holders, copies of the Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q that we would have been required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act if we were subject thereto (other than any exhibits that would have been required) and (ii) within 15 days following written request, to supply copies of such reports to any prospective holder of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock. The Company is required to mail (or otherwise provide) the reports to the holders of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock within 15 days after the respective dates by which we would have been required to file such reports with the SEC if we were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. 
 Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer . For information regarding restrictions on ownership and transfer of the Series C Preferred Shares, see All Classes of Our Capital Stock above. 
 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Series C Preferred Shares, no holder of the Series C Preferred Shares will be entitled to convert any Series C Preferred Shares into our common shares to the extent that receipt of our common shares would cause such holder or any other person to exceed the ownership limits contained in our declaration of trust. 
 Series D Preferred Stock 
 Ranking . The Series D Preferred Stock ranks, with respect to distribution rights and rights upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, senior to all classes or series of our common stock and to any other class or series of our capital stock which is expressly designated as ranking junior to the Series D Preferred Stock (collectively, Series D Junior Stock ), on parity with any class of our capital stock which is expressly designated as ranking on parity with the Series D Preferred Stock (collectively, Series D Parity Stock ), including our Series B Preferred Stock and our Series C Preferred Stock, junior to any other class or series of our capital stock that we may later authorize or issue which is designated as ranking senior to the Series D Preferred Stock, and junior to our existing and future indebtedness. Any future authorization or issuance of a class or series of our capital stock expressly designated as ranking senior to the Series D Preferred Stock will require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock and all other shares of any class or series ranking on parity with the Series D Preferred Stock that are entitled to similar voting rights, including our Series B Preferred Stock and our Series C Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class). 
 Distributions . Subject to the preferential rights of any security senior to the Series D Preferred Stock as to distributions, the holders of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if authorized by our board of directors and declared by us out of funds legally available for the payment of 
 20 

distributions, cumulative cash distributions at the rate of 8.25 per annum of the 25.00 liquidation preference per share of the Series D Preferred Stock (equivalent to an annual rate of 2.0625 per share of the Series D Preferred Stock). Distributions are payable quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of January, April, July and October of each year (or if not a business day, on the next succeeding business day). Distributions payable on the Series D Preferred Stock for any partial or longer period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Accrued but unpaid distributions on the Series D Preferred Stock will accumulate as of the distribution payment date on which they first became payable. Distributions on the Series D Preferred Stock will accrue whether or not: 
 we have earnings; 

there are funds legally available for the payment of those distributions; or 

those distributions are authorized or declared. 

Except as described in the next paragraph, unless full cumulative distributions on the Series D Preferred Stock for all past distribution periods shall have been, or contemporaneously are, declared and paid in cash or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof in cash is set aside for payment, we will not: 
 declare or pay or set aside for payment of distributions, and we will not declare or make any distribution of cash or other property, directly or indirectly, on or with respect to any shares of our common stock, or any other class or series of Series D Parity Stock or Series D Junior Stock for any period; or 

redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire for any consideration, or make any other distribution of cash or other property, directly or indirectly, on or with respect to, or pay or make available any monies for a sinking fund for the redemption of, any common stock, or any other class or series of Series D Parity Stock or Series D Junior Stock. 

The foregoing sentence, however, will not prohibit: 
 distributions payable solely in shares of our common stock or shares of Series D Junior Stock; 

the conversion into or exchange for other shares of any class or series of Series D Junior Stock; and 

our purchase of Series D Preferred Stock, Series D Parity Stock or Series D Junior Stock pursuant to our Charter to the extent necessary to preserve our status as a REIT. 

Optional Redemption . We may not redeem the Series D Preferred Stock prior to April 18, 2024, except as described herein under Special Optional Redemption and Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer. On and after April 18, 2024, we may, at our option, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days written notice, redeem the Series D Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, for cash at a redemption price of 25.00 per share of Series D Preferred Stock, plus all accrued and unpaid distributions (whether or not declared) up to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption, without interest, to the extent we have funds legally available for that purpose. Unless full cumulative distributions on all outstanding Series D Preferred Stock shall have been or contemporaneously are authorized, declared and paid in cash or declared and a sufficient sum set aside for payment of all past distribution periods and the then-current distribution period, no shares of the Series D Preferred Stock shall be redeemed unless all outstanding shares of the Series D Preferred Stock are simultaneously redeemed. All shares of Series D Preferred Stock that we redeem or repurchase will be retired and restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock, without designation as to series or class. 
 If the Company has (i) given a notice of redemption, (ii) set aside sufficient funds for the redemption in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock called for redemption and (iii) given irrevocable instructions to pay the redemption price and all accrued and unpaid distributions, then from and after the redemption date, those shares of Series D Preferred Stock will be treated as no longer being outstanding, no further distributions will accrue and all other rights of the holders of those shares of Series D Preferred Stock will terminate (including, with respect to such shares of Series D Preferred Stock called for redemption, the conversion rights described below under Conversion Rights ), except the right to receive the redemption price 
 21 

plus any accrued and unpaid distributions payable upon such redemption, without interest. The holders of those shares of Series D Preferred Stock will retain their right to receive the redemption price for their shares and any accrued and unpaid distributions payable upon such redemption, without interest. 
 The holders of shares of Series D Preferred Stock at the close of business on a distribution record date will be entitled to receive the distribution payable with respect to the Series D Preferred Stock on the corresponding payment date notwithstanding the redemption of the Series D Preferred Stock between such record date and the corresponding payment date. 
 Special Optional Redemption . Upon the occurrence of a Series D Change of Control (as defined below), we may, at our option, redeem the Series D Preferred Stock, in whole or in part within 120 days after the first date on which such Series D Change of Control occurred, by paying 25.00 per share of Series D Preferred Stock, plus any accrued and unpaid distributions to, but not including, the date of redemption. If, prior to the relevant Change of Control Conversion Date, we have provided or provide notice of redemption with respect to the Series D Preferred Stock (whether pursuant to our optional redemption right or our special optional redemption right), a holder of Series D Preferred Stock will not have the conversion right described below under Conversion Rights, in respect of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock called for redemption. 
 A notice of redemption is required to be mailed to the record holders of shares of our Series D Preferred Stock no less than 30 days nor more than 60 days before the redemption date. A failure to give notice of redemption or any defect in the notice or in its mailing will not affect the validity of the redemption of any Series D Preferred Stock except as to the holder to whom notice was defective. Each notice will state the following: 
 the redemption date; 

the redemption price; 

the number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed; 

the place or places where the certificates for the shares of the Series D Preferred Stock, if any, are to be surrendered for payment; 

the procedures for surrendering non-certificated shares of Series D Preferred Stock, to the extent the shares of Series D Preferred Stock are uncertificated, for payment of the redemption price; 

that distributions on the shares of Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed will cease to accumulate on such redemption date; 

that payment of the redemption price and any accumulated and unpaid distributions will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Series D Preferred Stock; and 

that the holders of the shares of our Series D Preferred Stock to which the notice relates will not be able to tender such shares of Series D Preferred Stock for conversion in connection with the Series D Change of Control and each share of Series D Preferred Stock tendered for conversion that is selected, prior to the relevant Change of Control Conversion Date, for redemption will be redeemed on the related date of redemption instead of converted on the relevant Change of Control Conversion Date. 

If the Company has (i) given a notice of redemption, (ii) set aside sufficient funds for the redemption in trust for the benefit of the holders of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock called for redemption and (iii) given irrevocable instructions to pay the redemption price and all accrued and unpaid distributions, then from and after the redemption date, those shares of Series D Preferred Stock will be treated as no longer being outstanding, no further distributions will accrue and all other rights of the holders of those shares of Series D Preferred Stock will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price plus any accrued and unpaid distributions payable upon such redemption, without interest. The holders of those shares of Series D Preferred Stock will retain their right to receive the redemption price for their shares and any accrued and unpaid distributions payable upon such redemption, without interest. 
 22 

The holders of shares of Series D Preferred Stock at the close of business on a distribution record date will be entitled to receive the distribution payable with respect to the Series D Preferred Stock on the corresponding payment date notwithstanding the redemption of the Series D Preferred Stock between such record date and the corresponding payment date. 
 A Series D Change of Control is when, after the original issuance of the Series D Preferred Stock, the following have occurred and are continuing: 
 the acquisition by any person, including any syndicate or group deemed to be a person under Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, of beneficial ownership, directly or indirectly, through a purchase, merger or other acquisition transaction or series of purchases, mergers or other acquisition transactions of shares of our company entitling that person to exercise more than 50 of the total voting power of all shares of our company entitled to vote generally in elections of directors (except that such person will be deemed to have beneficial ownership of all securities that such person has the right to acquire, whether such right is currently exercisable or is exercisable only upon the occurrence of a subsequent condition); and 

following the closing of any transaction referred to in the bullet point above, neither we nor the acquiring or surviving entity has a class of common securities (or ADRs representing such securities) listed on the NYSE, the NYSE American or NASDAQ or listed or quoted on an exchange or quotation system that is a successor to the NYSE, the NYSE American or NASDAQ. 

Conversion Rights . Upon the occurrence of a Series D Change of Control, each holder of shares of Series D Preferred Stock will have the right, unless, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, the Company has provided or provides notice of its election to redeem the shares of Series D Preferred Stock as described under Optional Redemption or Special Optional Redemption, to convert some or all of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock held by such holder (the Change of Control Series D Conversion Righ t on the applicable Change of Control Conversion Date into a number of shares of common stock per share of Series D Preferred Stock (the Series D Conversion Consideration equal to the lesser of: 
 the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the sum of the 25.00 liquidation preference per share of the Series D Preferred Stock to be converted plus the amount of any accrued and unpaid distributions to, but not including, the relevant Change of Control Conversion Date (unless such Change of Control Conversion Date is after a record date for a Series D Preferred Stock distribution payment and prior to the corresponding Series D Preferred Stock distribution payment date, in which case no additional amount for such accrued and unpaid distribution will be included in this sum) by (ii) the Series D Common Stock Price (as defined below); and 

7.39645 (the Series D Share Cap ), subject to adjustments, as described below. 

The Series D Share Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any share splits (including those effected pursuant to a common stock distribution), subdivisions or combinations (in each case, a Series D Share Split with respect to shares of our common stock as follows: the adjusted Series D Share Cap as the result of a Series D Share Split will be the number of shares of our common stock that is equivalent to the product of (i) the Series D Share Cap in effect immediately prior to such Series D Share Split multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of our common stock outstanding after giving effect to such Series D Share Split and the denominator of which is the number of shares of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to such Series D Share Split. 
 For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, the aggregate number of shares of our common stock (or equivalent Alternative Series D Conversion Consideration (as defined below), as applicable) issuable in connection with the exercise of the Change of Control Series D Conversion Right will not exceed 7,988,166 shares of common stock (or equivalent Alternative Series D Conversion Consideration, as applicable), subject to increase on a pro rata basis if we issue additional shares of Series D Preferred Stock (the Series D Exchange Cap ). The Series D Exchange Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any Series D Share Splits on the same basis as the corresponding adjustment to the Series D Share Cap. 
 23 

In the case of a Series D Change of Control pursuant to which shares of our common stock will be converted into cash, securities or other property or assets (including any combination thereof) (the Alternative Series D Form Consideration ), a holder of shares of Series D Preferred Stock will receive upon conversion of such Series D Preferred Stock the kind and amount of Alternative Series D Form Consideration which such holder would have owned or been entitled to receive upon the Series D Change of Control had such holder held a number of shares of our common stock equal to the Series D Conversion Consideration immediately prior to the effective time of the Series Change of Control (the Alternative Series D Conversion Consideration , and the Series D Conversion Consideration or the Alternative Series D Conversion Consideration, as may be applicable to a Series D Change of Control, is referred to as the Series D Conversion Consideration ). 
 If the holders of shares of our common stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in the Series D Change of Control, the consideration that the holders of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock will receive will be the form of consideration elected by the holders of the shares of common stock who participate in the determination (based on the weighted average of elections) and will be subject to any limitations to which all holders of shares of common stock are subject, including, without limitation, pro rata reductions applicable to any portion of the consideration payable in the Series D Change of Control. 
 No fractional shares of the Company s common stock will be issued upon the conversion of our Series D Preferred Stock. Instead, we will pay the cash value of such fractional shares. 
 Within 15 days following the occurrence of a Series D Change of Control, the Company is required to provide to holders of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock a notice of the occurrence of the Series D Change of Control that describes the resulting Change of Control Series D Conversion Right. This notice will state the following:

the number of Series D Preferred Stock to be converted; and 

that the Series D Preferred Stock is to be converted pursuant to the applicable terms of the Series D Preferred Stock. 

The Series D Common Stock Price will be (i) if the consideration to be received in the Series D Change of Control by holders of shares of our common stock is solely cash, the amount of cash consideration per share of common stock, or (ii) if the consideration to be received in the Series D Change of Control by holders of shares of our common stock is other than solely cash, the average of the closing price per share of common stock on the 10 consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the effective date of the Series D Change of Control. 
 Holders of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock may withdraw any notice of exercise of a Change of Control Series D Conversion Right (in whole or in part) by a written notice of withdrawal delivered to our transfer agent prior to the close of business on the business day prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date. The notice of withdrawal must state: 
 the number of withdrawn shares of Series D Preferred Stock; 

if certificated shares of Series D Preferred Stock have been issued, the certificate numbers of the withdrawn shares of Series D Preferred Stock; and 

the number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock, if any, which remain subject to the conversion notice. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Series D Preferred Stock is held in global form, the conversion notice and/or the notice of withdrawal, as applicable, must comply with applicable procedures of The Depository Trust Company. 
 Series D Preferred Stock as to which the Change of Control Series D Conversion Right has been properly exercised and for which the conversion notice has not been properly withdrawn will be converted into the applicable Series D Conversion Consideration in accordance with the Change of Control Series D Conversion Right on the applicable Change of Control Conversion Date, unless prior to such Change of Control Conversion Date the Company has provided or provides notice of its election to redeem such Series D Preferred Stock, whether pursuant to the Company s optional redemption right or its special optional redemption right. If the Company elects to redeem Series D Preferred Stock that would otherwise be converted into the applicable Series D Conversion Consideration on a Change of Control Conversion Date, such Series D Preferred Stock will not be so converted and the holders of such shares of Series D Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive on the applicable redemption date 25.00 per share of Series D Preferred Stock, plus any accrued and unpaid distribution thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. 
 The Company is required to deliver amounts owing upon conversion no later than the third business day following the applicable Change of Control Conversion Date. 
 Notwithstanding any other provision of our Series D Preferred Stock, no holder of shares of our Series D Preferred Stock will be entitled to convert such shares Series D Preferred Stock for shares of our common stock to the extent that receipt of such shares of common stock would cause such holder (or any other person) to exceed the share ownership limits contained in our Charter, including the Articles Supplementary. See Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer above. 
 Except as provided above in connection with a Series D Change of Control, shares of Series D Preferred Stock are not convertible into or exchangeable for any other securities or property. 
 Liquidation Preference . Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, and before any distribution or payment shall be made to holders of our common stock or any other class or series of Series D Junior Stock, the holders of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock are entitled to be paid out of our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders, after payment or provision for our debts and other liabilities, payments to holders of senior securities, if any, a liquidation preference of 25.00 per share of Series D 
 25 

Preferred Stock, plus an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid distributions (whether or not earned or declared) up to, but not including, the date of payment or the date the amount of payment is set aside. The rights of holders of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock to receive their liquidation preference will be subject to the proportionate rights of holders of our Series B Preferred Stock, our Series C Preferred Stock and any other class or series of Series D Parity Stock. After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distributions to which they are entitled, the holders of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock will have no right or claim to any of our remaining assets. Our consolidation, conversion or merger with or into any other corporation, trust or other entity, or the voluntary sale, lease, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of our property or business, will not be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs. 
 No Maturity, Sinking Fund or Mandatory Redemption . The Series D Preferred Stock has no maturity date and we are not required to redeem shares of the Series D Preferred Stock at any time. Accordingly, the Series D Preferred Stock will remain outstanding indefinitely, unless we decide, at our option, to exercise our optional redemption right described under Optional Redemption or, upon a Series D Change of Control, we decide, at our option, to exercise our special redemption right described under Special Optional Redemption or holders of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock decide to exercise the conversion right described under Conversion Rights. The Series D Preferred Stock is not subject to any sinking fund. 
 Voting Rights . Holders of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock have no voting rights, except as set forth below. 
 If distributions on the Series D Preferred Stock are in arrears for six or more quarterly periods, whether or not consecutive, holders of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class with holders of our Series B Preferred Stock, our Series C Preferred Stock and all other classes or series of Series D Parity Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) will be entitled to vote at a special meeting or at our next annual meeting of stockholders and each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders, for the election of two additional directors to serve on our board of directors (which we refer to as a preferred stock director), until all unpaid distributions and the distribution for the then current period with respect to the Series D Preferred Stock and any other class or series of Series D Parity Stock have been fully paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for payment. In such a case, the number of directors serving on the board of directors will be increased by two members. The preferred stock directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in the election to serve until our next annual meeting and until their successors are duly elected and qualified or until such directors right to hold the office terminates pursuant to the Series D Termination Event (as defined below), whichever occurs earlier. In no event will the holders of Series D Preferred Stock be entitled to nominate or elect an individual as a director, and no individual will be qualified to be nominated for election or to serve as a director, if the individual s service as a director would cause us to fail to satisfy a requirement relating to director independence of any national securities exchange on which any class or series of our stock is then-listed or otherwise conflict with our Charter or Bylaws. 
 If and when all accumulated distributions and the distribution for the current distribution period on the Series D Preferred Stock and for all classes and series of Series D Parity Stock and upon which similar voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable shall have been paid in full or a sum sufficient for such payment is irrevocably deposited in trust for payment, the holders of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock shall be immediately divested of the voting rights set forth above and, if all distributions in arrears and the distributions for the current distribution period have been paid in full or set aside for payment in full on all other classes or series of Series D Parity Stock, the term and office of such preferred stock directors so elected will terminate immediately and the number of members constituting our board of directors will be reduced accordingly (the Series D Termination Event ). The right of the holders of Series D Preferred Stock to elect the additional directors will again vest if and whenever dividends are in arrears for six additional quarterly periods, whether or not consecutive, as described above. 
 In addition, so long as any shares of Series D Preferred Stock remain outstanding, we will not, without the consent or the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock and each other class or series of Series D Parity Stock with respect to the payment of distributions or the 
 26 

distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up upon which similar voting rights have been conferred, voting as a single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting: 
 authorize, create or issue, or increase the authorized or issued amount of, any class or series of stock ranking senior to the Series D Preferred Stock with respect to payment of distributions, or the distribution of assets upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, or reclassify any of our authorized stock into any such stock, or create, authorize or issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase any such stock; or 

amend, alter or repeal the provisions of our Charter or the terms of the Series D Preferred Stock, whether by merger, consolidation, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of our assets or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the Series D Preferred Stock or the holders thereof; 

except that with respect to the occurrence of any of the events described in the second bullet point immediately above, so long as shares of the Series D Preferred Stock remain outstanding with the terms of the Series D Preferred Stock materially unchanged or the holders of shares of Series D Preferred Stock receive capital stock of the successor with substantially identical rights (taken as a whole), taking into account that, upon the occurrence of an event described in the second bullet point above, we may not be the surviving entity, the occurrence of such event will not be deemed to materially and adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting power of holders of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock, and in such case such holders shall not have any voting rights with respect to the events described in the second bullet point immediately above. 

Furthermore, if the holders of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock receive the greater of the full trading price of the Series D Preferred Stock on the date of an event described in the second bullet point immediately above or the 25.00 liquidation preference per share of Series D Preferred Stock pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events described in the second bullet point immediately above, then such holders shall not have any voting rights with respect to the events described in the second bullet point immediately above. If any event described in the second bullet point above would materially and adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series D Preferred Stock disproportionately relative to other classes or series of Series D Parity Stock with respect to the payment of distributions and the distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock voting separately as a class, will also be required. 
 Information Rights . During any period in which we are not subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and any shares of Series D Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Company is required (i) to transmit by mail or other permissible means under the Exchange Act to all holders of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock as their names and addresses appear in our record books and without cost to such holders, copies of the Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q that we would have been required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act if we were subject thereto (other than any exhibits that would have been required) and (ii) within 15 days following written request, to supply copies of such reports to any prospective holder of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock. The Company is required to mail (or otherwise provide) the reports to the holders of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock within 15 days after the respective dates by which we would have been required to file such reports with the SEC if we were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. 
 Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer . For information regarding restrictions on ownership and transfer of the Series D Preferred Shares, see All Classes of Our Capital Stock above. 
 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Series D Preferred Shares, no holder of the Series D Preferred Shares will be entitled to convert any Series D Preferred Shares into our common shares to the extent that receipt of our common shares would cause such holder or any other person to exceed the ownership limits contained in our declaration of trust.
