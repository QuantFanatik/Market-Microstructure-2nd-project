SPECIAL
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
annual report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference herein contain forward-looking statements that are not statements
of historical fact and may involve a number of risks and uncertainties. These statements related to analyses and other information that
are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable. These statements may also relate to our future
prospects, developments and business strategies. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that
may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels
of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. 

In
some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, should, expects, 
 plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential, 
 proposed, intended, or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.
You should read statements that contain these words carefully, because they discuss our expectations about our future operating results
or our future financial condition or state other forward-looking information. There may be events in the future that we
are not able to accurately predict or control. Before you invest in our securities, you should be aware that the occurrence of any of
the events described in this Annual Report could substantially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition, and
that upon the occurrence of any of these events, the trading price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of
your investment. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee
future results, growth rates, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking
statements after the date of this Annual Report to conform these statements to actual results. 

The
following factors are among those that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements: 

General
 economic and industry conditions; 

Out
 history of losses, deficits and negative operating cash flows; 

Our
 limited operating history; 

Industry
 competition; 

Environmental
 and governmental regulation; 

Protection
 and defense of our intellectual property rights; 

Reliance
 on, and the ability to attract, key personnel; 

Other
 factors including those discussed in Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K and our incorporated documents. 

You
should keep in mind that any forward-looking statement made by us in this annual report or elsewhere speaks only as of the date on which
we make it. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict these events or how they may
affect us. We have no duty to, and do not intend to, update or revise the forward-looking statements in this annual report after the
date of filing, except as may be required by law. In light of these risks and uncertainties, you should keep in mind that any forward-looking
statement made in this annual report or elsewhere might not occur. 

In
this annual report on Form 10-K, the terms CLOQ, Company, we, us and our 
refer to CyberloQ Technologies, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary CyberloQ Technologies, LTD. 

ITEM
 1. 
 BUSINESS 

Company
History 

CyberloQ
Technologies Inc. CLOQ , We or the Company was incorporated in Nevada on February 5, 2008
as Advanced Credit Technologies, Inc. The Company changed its name to CyberloQ Technologies, Inc. on November 20, 2019. The Company has
never been the subject of any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding. The Company has never been involved in any material reclassification,
merger, or consolidation. 

On
June 15, 2017, the Company created a private limited company in the United Kingdom named CyberloQ Technologies LTD. CyberloQ Technologies
LTD is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and any business that the Company has in the United Kingdom will be transacted through
CyberloQ Technologies LTD. However, to date CyberloQ Technologies LTD has had no activity, operational or otherwise. 

3 

Current
Overview of the Company 

The
Company is a development-stage technology company focused on fraud prevention and credit management. 

The
Company offers a proprietary software platform branded as CyberloQ . While previously the Company licensed CyberloQ, in the third
quarter of 2017, the Company acquired the CyberloQ technology and is now the exclusive owner of CyberloQ. 

CyberloQ
is a MFA Multi Factor Authentication protocol technology that is offered to institutional clients in order to combat fraudulent transactions
and unauthorized access to customer accounts and or any digital asset. Through the use of a customer s smart-phone, CyberloQ uses
a multi-factor authentication system to control access to a bank card, transaction type or amount, website, database or digital service.
The mobile applications for CyberloQ have been built, and have been successfully integrated into the banking ecosystem. The Company has
also updated the entire infrastructure, UI/UX and streamlined the deliverable services per strategic partnerships with clients in multiple
channels in order to increase the scalability of the original platform. 

In
addition to CyberloQ, the Company offers a web-based proprietary software platform under the brand name TurnScor which allows customers
to monitor and manage their credit from the privacy of their own homes. Although individuals can sign-up for TurnScor on their own, the
Company also intends to market TurnScor to certain institutional clients, where appropriate, in conjunction with CyberloQ as a value-added
benefit to offer their customers. 

The
CyberloQ Vault is a cloud based security protocol that allows clients the ability to send/receive secure data without having
to use traditional e-mail which is prone to a breach. This CyberloQ service uses cloud-based encryption and a secure web portal to send/receive
confidential data, the sender and receiver both must have authenticated their position within the prescribed geo coordinates as well
as authenticate their mobile devices prior to sending/receiving any data. Thus, rendering a hack or breach utterly useless for the encrypted
data is unusable without the CyberloQ authentication component. 

The
Company currently has two full-time employees its President and Vice-President. There are no other employees of the Company at
this time. 

The
Company also has a Board of Advisors comprised of individuals from the banking, business development, and technical sectors to advise
the Company as it moves forward with its business strategy. The Board of Advisors does not have any decision-making authority. 

ITEM
 1A. 
 RISK
 FACTORS 

The
Company qualifies as a smaller reporting company as defined by 229.10(f)(1) and therefore is not required to provide the information
required by this Item. However, the Company does acknowledge that there are risks associated with the business of the Company. 

We
will be competing with a variety of companies, many of which have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources
than us. If we fail to attract and retain a large base of customers for our products, or if our competitors establish a more prominent
market position relative to ours, this will inhibit our ability to grow and successfully execute our business plan. For example, Wells
Fargo has introduced an on/off feature for their customers, Discover Card has Freeze It functionality, and
Ondot Systems has already been operating in the mobile card security space for quite some time. However, the Company believes that the
multi-purpose functionality of CyberloQ, along with its multi-purpose applications will give the Company a distinct advantage by comparison.
CyberloQ can be used in the banking system to protect debit/credit cards, in the Health Care industry to protect PII (Personal Identifying
Information) now that medical records are kept digitally, and can protect corporate data bases in any industry from outside intrusion
via geo-fencing. The Company believes that these distinct features, along with the ability to White Label the technology
for marketing partners, give the Company a distinction in the marketplace. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to
successfully compete with other companies in the marketplace. 

In
addition, the Company could incur increased costs, decreased revenue, or suffer reputational damage in the event of a cyber-attack. The
Company s business involves the collection, storage, processing and transmission of customers personal data, including financial
information. In the event that the Company s security measures are breached due to human error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities,
or other irregularities, such breach could adversely affect our business through possible interruption of the Company s operations,
improper disclosure of data, damage to the Company s reputation, and/or legal exposure.

ITEM
 3. 
 LEGAL
 PROCEEDINGS 

The
Company is currently a party to one legal proceeding pending in the Superior Court of New Jersey entitled Mark Carten v. Cyberloq
Technologies, Inc. (UNN-L-3456-22). The Plaintiff is the Company s former Chief Technology Officer, and the employee 
complaint alleges that the Company breached the February 28, 2022 separation and common stock redemption agreements, seeking an unspecified
amount of monetary damages as well as a judgment of specific performance for the company to purchase the remaining shares of common stock
owned by the employee. The Company believes that the employee s claims have no merit and intends to defend itself vigorously. 

The
Company is not currently a party to any other legal proceedings, nor is the Company a party to any administrative proceedings. 

In
addition, the Company s officers and directors have not been convicted in any criminal proceedings nor have they been permanently

 MANAGEMENT S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Liquidity,
Capital Resources and Material Changes in Financial Condition 

As
of December 31, 2022, total assets were 341,118 compared to 264,503 in assets as of December 31, 2021. The Company s fixed assets
increased from 0 to 283,240 due to the capitalization of the CyberloQ Platform, while the Company s prepaid expense decreased
from 210,208 to 53,811 due to the Company s continued amortization of the prior issuance of 1,250,000 shares of stock to consultants
that are being amortized over the one-year length of the contracts on a straight-line basis. In addition, the Company s cash assets
were 4,067 as of December 31, 2022 as opposed to 54,295 as of December 31, 2021. 

As
of December 31, 2022, liabilities were 324,132 compared to 299,530 in liabilities as of December 31, 2021. This increase the Company s
liabilities was due to increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 12,762, and convertible debt of 60,000 and accrued interest
of 21,317 partially offset by a decrease of loans from stockholders of 10,000 and long term note payable of 2,100. 

Net
cash used in operating activities for 2022 was 371,963 compared to net cash used in operating activities for 2021 of 664,596. Cash
provided by or used by operating activities is driven by our net loss, which was approximately 108,600 less than 2021, and adjusted
by non-cash items as well as changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash adjustments for 2022 include stock compensation of
 350,643 and loss on settlement of debt of 195,216. 

Net
cash used by investing activities for 2022 was 283,240 and was due to the Company capitalizing development costs for the CyberloQ platform. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 604,975 for 2022 as compared to 692,150 for 2021. Specifically, proceeds from common stock
issuance were 422,075 for 2022 as compared to 490,200 for 2021, and proceeds from common stock to be issued was 50,000 for 2022 as
compared to 193,000 for 2021. Conversely, proceeds from notes payable were 125,000 for 2022 compared to 22,500 for 2021. 

The
Company had operating revenue of 2,671 in 2022 and is currently reliant on its ability to raise additional capital and/or debt to continue
execution of its business plan to move the Company forward towards profitability. The Company does not anticipate any significant decrease
in its operating expenses for 2023. Unless the Company begins to generate operation revenue, it will be reliant on its ability to raise
additional debt and/or capital in order to continue its operations. 

Results
of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 

The
Company experienced a net loss of 979,048 for 2022 compared to net loss of 1,087,712 for 2021. 

6 

There
was no material change in the Company s service revenue. Service revenue was 2,671 for 2022 in comparison to 197 for 2021. 

This
decrease in the Company s net loss was primarily due to decreases in research and development expenses and offers compensation
expense and professional fees. 

Research
and development expenses were 0 in 2022, compared to 180,063 in 2021. This decrease in research expenses was due to the Company beginning
to capitalize the cost of development of the CyberloQ platform. 

Officers 
compensation expense was 207,000 in 2022 as compared to 370,400 in 2021. This decrease was due to the Company only having two officers
instead of three for the majority of 2022. 

Professional
fees were 424,503 in 2022, compared to 468,449 in 2021. This decrease in professional fees was due to decreased consulting services
and accounting services. 

The
foregoing drivers of the decrease in the Company s net loss for 2022 were partially offset by an increase in the Company s
computer an internet expense. 

Computer
and internet expenses were 24,796 in 2022 as compared to 10,859 in 2021. This increase was due to additional hosting costs associated
with the Company s private blockchain product. 

For
2022, there were no material changes in office expenses and supplies, rent expense, travel and entertainment, office supplies and other
operating expenses as compared to 2021. 

In
summary, total revenue was 2,671 for 2022, and the Company is currently reliant on its ability to raise additional debt and/or capital
to continue execution of its business plan to move forward towards profitability. Whether or not there are any material changes in operational
revenues or expenses in 2023 will be highly-dependent upon the Company s ability to enter into material revenue contracts with
customers.

 9A. 
 CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers,
or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

7 

An
evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022 in accordance with the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission s 2013 Integrated Framework. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or

In addition, due to its current size, the Company currently does not have sufficient staff to maintain appropriate segregation of duties,
as it pertains to application and oversight of internal control processes. Material weaknesses have previously been identified, including
lack of segregation of duties and lack of formal written policies and procedures surrounding financial close and reporting. However,
the Company anticipates that as it grows and formalizes its internal control processes and procedures, it will add sufficient staff to
perform internal control processes, as well as adequately provided oversight to ensure processes are working as designed. Such officer
also confirmed that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three-month period ended December
31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Promoters
and Certain Control Persons 

The
Company has not had a promoter at any time during the last five fiscal years. 

In
addition, there are no parents of the Company. 

Director
Independence 

The
directors of the Company, which also include the executive officers of the Company, are not independent directors. Members of the Company s
management may become associated with other firms involved in a range of business activities. Consequently, there are potential inherent
conflicts of interest in their acting as officers and directors of the Company. Insofar as the officers and directors are engaged in
other business activities, management anticipates they will devote as much time to the Company s affairs as is reasonably needed. 

13 

The
officers and directors are, so long as they are officers or directors of the Company, subject to the restriction that all opportunities
contemplated by the Company s plan of operation which come to their attention, either in the performance of their duties or in
any other manner, will be considered opportunities of, and be made available to the Company and the companies that they are affiliated
with on an equal basis. A breach of this requirement will be a breach of the fiduciary duties of the officer or director. If the Company
or the companies in which the officers and directors are affiliated with both desire to take advantage of an opportunity, then said officers
and directors would abstain from negotiating and voting upon the opportunity. However, all directors may still individually take advantage
of opportunities if the Company should decline to do so. 

In
addition, the Company has a Related-Party Transactions Policy whereby the officers and directors of the Company are required to report
to the Board of Directors any activity that would cause or appear to cause a conflict of interest on his or her part. All related-party
transactions are subject to review, approval or ratification in accordance with the Related-Party Transactions Policy.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Cyberloq
Technologies, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Cyberloq Technologies, Inc. the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, changes in stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December
31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has an accumulated
deficit since inception and continuing net losses. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below are
matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the
audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions
on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Equity Transactions (Note 5 to the financial
statements) 

Description of the Critical Audit Matter 

The Company s evaluation of common shares issuances
involves complexity and judgement in applying the relevant accounting standards when auditing management s conclusions on the classification
and recognition of equity transactions upon issuance. 

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in
the Audit 

Our principal audit procedures to evaluate management s
calculation and recording of common share issuances included the following: 

We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management s methods and assumptions used in
the identification, recognition, measurement, and disclosure of considerations of the underlying share issuances during the year, including
the classification with respect to the terms and in considering applicable generally accepted accounting standards. 
 
 We read the applicable agreements and compared the key terms to management s analysis of the transaction. 
 
 We read, evaluated, and tested the reasonableness of management s calculation utilized in the determination
of common shares issued. 
 
 We evaluated whether management had appropriately considered new information that could significantly
change the measurement or disclosure of common shares, and evaluated the disclosures related to the financial statement impacts of the
transactions. 
 
 We reviewed current and subsequent period accounting records and third-party documentation to identify
unrecorded equity transactions. 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2017.

The
Company follows FASB ASC 360-10, Property, Plant, and Equipment, which established a primary asset 
approach to determine the cash flow estimation period for a group of assets and liabilities that represents the unit of accounting for
a long-lived asset to be held and used. Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not
recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. As of December 31,
2020, the Company wrote-off the book value of the Cyberloq technology software fixed asset and recorded software impairment expense of
 . Even though the software asset was written-off as impaired as of December 31, 2020, the software asset continued to be functionable
but required updating the software programming code to current technology standards. During 2021, the Company developed and implemented
a business plan to fully update the Cyberloq secure solution and feasibility of the software to meet the demands of the market. As of
January 1, 2022, the Company s began capitalizing CyberloQ platform development costs which totaled as of December 31,
2022. 

Revenue
Recognition Policy 

Under
ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. To achieve the core principle of ASC 606,
the Company performs the following steps: 

1)
Identify the contract(s) with a customer; 

 2)
Identify the performance obligations in the contract; 

 3)
Determine the transaction price; 

 4)
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 

 5)
Recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation. 

The
Company derives its revenue from development, customization and user fees for the CyberloQ banking fraud technology products, including
CyberloQ Vault, and from licensing fees for the TurnScor product. 

The
revenue derived from the CyberloQ banking fraud technology products are comprised of two components. First, there is a development and
customization fee paid to the Company to integrate CyberloQ with the banking institution or program manager s ecosystem in order
to add the CyberloQ authentication to the bank s payment cards, website or digital service. This fee is customarily paid in multiple
payments based upon the Company reaching certain milestones as set forth in the scope of work for each customer. Since completion of
a milestone is subject to each customer s approval, there are significant judgments involved in the determination of timing and
satisfaction of performance obligations and the payments are recognized as revenue upon the completion of each milestone. Second, revenue
from user fees are accrued monthly based on the number of individual cards and/or services used each month. 

The
revenue derived from CyberloQ Vault is also comprised of two components. First, there is a development and customization fee paid to
the Company to build a customized cloud-based encryption and a secure web portal to send/receive confidential data. This fee is customarily
paid in multiple payments based upon the Company reaching certain milestones as set forth in the scope of work for each customer. Since
completion of a milestone is subject to each customer s approval, there are significant judgments involved in the determination
of timing and satisfaction of performance obligations and the payments are recognized as revenue over the completion of each milestone.
Second, revenue from a monthly user fee is accrued monthly based upon the number of individual users of the product each month. 

License
fees generated by the nonexclusive licensing of the Company s TurnScor product are accrued monthly. 

As
of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had in contract assets and contract liabilities. 

The
Company has adopted FASB ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. FASB ASC 820-10 defines fair value,
and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for
fair value measures. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify
as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination
of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The three levels of valuation hierarchy
are defined as follows: 

Level
 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

Level
 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that
 are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 

Level
 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. 

The
Company did not identify any other non-recurring assets and liabilities that are required to be presented in the balance sheets at fair
value in accordance with FASB ASC 815.

as of December 31, 2022 that includes a
loss of for the year ended December 31, 2022. Further losses are anticipated in the development of its business. Accordingly,
there is substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the financial statements
are issued. 

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or, obtaining
the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. 

Management
anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional debt and/or investment capital to fund operating expenses.
The Company intends to position itself so that it may be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management s
efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and
continue as a going concern.

the termination, all of the not-yet-redeemed shares became immediately freely transferable by the employee without restriction. The Company
then released the restriction on the shares and eliminated the liabilities and shares to be redeemed on the balance sheet. 

In
November of 2022, the employee initiated a lawsuit currently pending in the Superior Court of New Jersey entitled Mark Carten v. Cyberloq
Technologies, Inc. (UNN-L-3456-22). The employee s lawsuit alleges that the Company breached the February 28, 2022 separation and
common stock redemption agreements, and seeks an unspecified amount of monetary damages as well as a judgment of specific performance
for the company to purchase the remaining shares of common stock owned by the employee. The Company believes that the employee s
claims have no merit and intends to defend itself vigorously.

for federal purposes. The federal Given the Company s
history of net operating losses, management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will not be able to realize
the tax benefit of the net operating loss carry forwards. Accordingly, the Company has recognized a valuation allowance that offsets
the deferred tax asset for this benefit. 

FASB
ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes (formerly SFAS 109) requires that the Company establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely
than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. Due to restrictions imposed by Internal Revenue Code Section
382 regarding substantial changes in ownership of companies with net operating loss carry forwards, the utilization of the Company s
net operating loss carry-forward will likely be limited as a result of cumulative changes in stock ownership. The Company has not recognized
a deferred asset and, as a result, the change in stock ownership will not result in any change to the valuation allowances. Upon the
attainment of taxable income by the Company, management will assess the likelihood of realizing the tax benefit associated with the use
of the carry forwards and will recognize a deferred tax asset at that time.
