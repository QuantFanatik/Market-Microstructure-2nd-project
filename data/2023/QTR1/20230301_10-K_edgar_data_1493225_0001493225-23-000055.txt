 Northfield Bank 
 Northfield Bank was organized in 1887 and is a federally chartered savings bank. Northfield Bank conducts business from its operations center located in Woodbridge, New Jersey, its home office located in Staten Island, New York, and its 37 additional branch offices located in New York and New Jersey. The branch offices are located in Staten Island, Brooklyn, and the New Jersey counties of Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, and Union. Northfield Bank also offers select loan and deposit products through the internet. 
 On July 1, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of VSB Bancorp, Inc. Victory ), parent company of Victory State Bank, in a stock transaction, which, after purchase accounting adjustments, added 402.8 million to total assets, including 180.4 million to loans, and 354.6 million to deposits. Victory State Bank operated six branch offices in Staten Island, New York (two of which were subsequently consolidated with existing branches). Under the terms of the merger agreement, each share of Victory common stock was exchanged for 2.0463 shares of Northfield common stock with fractional shares paid out in cash, valued at approximately 41.2 million. 
 Northfield Bank s principal business consists of originating commercial real estate loans (primarily loans secured by multifamily properties), construction and land loans, commercial and industrial loans, and home equity loans and lines of credit. From time to time Northfield Bank will also purchase loan participations and pools of loans. For liquidity and other financial reasons, Northfield Bank will also purchase investment securities, including mortgage-backed securities and corporate bonds, and to a lesser extent deposit funds in other financial institutions, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB of New York FHLBNY ). Northfield Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts, including certificates of deposit, passbook, statement, and money market savings accounts, transaction deposit accounts (negotiable orders of withdrawal NOW accounts and interest and non-interest bearing demand accounts), individual retirement accounts, and, to a lesser extent, when it is deemed cost effective, brokered deposits.

Market Area and Competition 
 Northfield Bank has been in business since 1887, offering a variety of financial products and services to meet the needs of the communities we serve. Our commercial and retail banking network consists of multiple delivery channels including full-service banking offices, automated teller machines and telephone and internet banking capabilities, including mobile banking and remote deposit capture. We consider our competitive products and pricing, branch network, customer service, and financial position, as our major strengths in attracting and retaining customers in our market areas. 
 We face intense competition in our market areas both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our market areas have a high concentration of financial institutions, including large money center and regional banks, non-traditional banks, community banks, and credit unions. We face additional competition for deposits from money market funds, brokerage firms, mutual funds, and insurance companies. Some of our competitors offer products and services that we do not offer, such as trust services and private banking. In addition, competition has further intensified as a result of advances in technology and product delivery systems, and we face strong competition for our borrowers, depositors, and other customers from Financial Technology Fintech companies that provide web-based solutions to traditional retail banking services and products. Fintech companies tend to have stronger operating efficiencies and less regulatory burdens than traditional banks. 
 Our deposit sources are primarily concentrated in the communities surrounding our branch offices in the New York counties of Richmond (Staten Island) and Kings (Brooklyn), and Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Union counties in New Jersey. As of June 30, 2022 (the latest date for which information is publicly available), we ranked fourth in deposit market share out of 15 institutions for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC Insured Institutions in Staten Island with an 11.94 market share. As of that date, we ranked 16th in deposit market share out of 39 institutions with a 0.69 deposit market share in Brooklyn, New York, and we ranked 12th in deposit market share out of 51 financial institutions with a combined deposit market share of 1.51 in the Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Union counties in New Jersey. 
 The following table sets forth the unemployment rates for the communities we serve and the national average for the last five years, as published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics: 
 Unemployment Rate at December 31, 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 Hunterdon County, NJ 2.3 3.5 5.5 2.7 2.8 Middlesex County, NJ 2.7 4.3 6.6 3.0 3.1 Mercer County, NJ 2.5 3.8 6.0 3.1 3.1 Union County, NJ 3.3 5.3 7.8 3.7 3.7 Richmond County, NY 5.0 7.1 9.4 3.0 3.9 Kings County, NY 5.5 8.1 11.3 3.2 4.0 National Average 3.5 3.9 6.7 3.5 3.6

Lending Activities 
 Our principal lending activity is the origination of multifamily real estate loans and, to a lesser extent, other commercial real estate loans (typically on office, retail, and industrial properties), in New York City, New Jersey, and eastern Pennsylvania. We also originate one-to-four family residential real estate loans (non-owner occupied investment properties), construction and land loans, commercial and industrial loans, and home equity loans and lines of credit. 
 Loan Originations, Purchases and Sales, Participations, and Servicing. All loans we originate are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures or are properly approved as exceptions to our policies and procedures. Our ability to originate fixed- or adjustable-rate loans is dependent on the relative demand for such loans, which is affected by various factors including current and anticipated future market interest rates. Our loan origination activity may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions that result in decreased loan demand. Our home equity loans and lines of credit typically are generated through digital and social media advertising, referrals from branch personnel, direct mail advertisements and online applications through our website. A significant portion of our multifamily real estate loans and other commercial real estate loans are generated with the use of third-party loan brokers. Our commercial and industrial loans typically are generated through our loan and business development officers and referrals from accountants and other professional contacts. We typically retain in our portfolio all loans we originate and generally only sell non-performing loans. Beginning in 2019, we began offering interest rate swap contracts to qualified commercial borrowers. 
 From time-to-time, we may sell or purchase participation interests in individual loans (in addition to loans we acquire in assisted transactions, mergers or acquisitions, and pool purchases). We underwrite our participation interest in the loans that we are purchasing according to our own underwriting criteria and procedures. At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding balances totaling 38.2 million of loan participations that we purchased (where we are not the primary lender). Additionally, there were 104.7 million of loan participations that we sold (where we are the primary lender). All loan participations are secured by real estate and adhere to our loan policies. At December 31, 2022, all participation loans were performing in accordance with their terms. 
 Loan Approval Procedures and Authority . Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory, underwriting standards approved by our Board of Directors. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower s ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral that will secure the loan, if any. To assess the borrower s ability to repay, we review the borrower s income and credit history, and information on the historical and projected income and expenses of the borrower. 
 In underwriting a loan secured by real property, we require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed or certified appraiser approved by our Board of Directors. For commercial real estate loans 500,000 or less, we generally obtain an evaluation from an independent firm. The appraisals and evaluations of multifamily and other commercial real estate properties are also reviewed by an independent appraisal management firm. We, along with the assistance of a third-party inspector, review and inspect properties before disbursement of funds during the term of a construction loan. Generally, management obtains updated appraisals when a loan is deemed impaired. These appraisals may be more limited than those prepared for the underwriting of a new loan. In addition, when we acquire other real estate owned, we generally obtain a current appraisal to substantiate the net carrying value of the asset. 
 The Board of Directors maintains a Loan Committee consisting of bank directors to: periodically review and recommend for approval our policies related to lending as prepared by management; approve or reject loan applicants meeting certain criteria; and monitor loan quality including concentrations and certain other aspects of our lending functions, as applicable. Certain Northfield Bank officers, at levels beginning with vice president, have individual lending authority that is approved by the Board of Directors.

Loan Portfolio Composition . On January 1, 2021, the Company adopted new accounting guidance known as the current expected credit loss CECL standard for measuring credit losses, which replaced the incurred loss methodology. As a result of adopting CECL, the Company combined its originated loan portfolio and the acquired loan portfolio into the respective portfolio segments. Other than to combine the originated and non-purchased credit-deteriorated PCD (formerly purchased credit-impaired PCI )) acquired loan portfolios, the Company's portfolio segments and loan classes remain unchanged following the adoption of the CECL standard. Prior period disclosures have been revised to conform to current period presentation (by combining originated and acquired portfolio segments), however, the Company did not recast comparative financial information and that is still presented in accordance with previous applicable provisions of U.S. GAAP. The following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio, by type of loan, at the dates indicated.

 At December 31, 2022, the Company had 3.59 billion in loans due to mature in 2038 and beyond, of which 94.4 million, or 2.64 , are fixed-rate loans. 
 Multifamily Real Estate Loans . Loans secured by multifamily properties totaled approximately 2.82 billion, or 66.6 of our total loan portfolio, at December 31, 2022. We include in this category properties having more than four residential units and a business or businesses where the majority of space is utilized for residential purposes, which we refer to as mixed-use. At December 31, 2022, we had 1,195 multifamily real estate loans, with an average loan balance of approximately 2.4 million, although there are a large number of loans with balances substantially greater than this average. At December 31, 2022, our largest multifamily real estate loan had a principal balance of 31.1 million, was secured by a garden-style apartment complex located in Essex County, New Jersey, and was performing in accordance with its original contractual terms. Substantially all of our multifamily real estate loans are secured by properties located in our primary market areas and eastern Pennsylvania. 
 Our multifamily real estate loans typically amortize over 30 years with negotiated interest rates that adjust after an initial five-, seven-, or 10-year period, and every five years thereafter. Adjustable-rate loan originations are generally tied to a specifically identified market rate index. We also originate, to a lesser extent, 10- to 15-year fixed-rate, fully amortizing loans. In general, our multifamily real estate loans have interest rate floors equal to the interest rate on the date the loan is originated, and have prepayment penalties should the loan be prepaid during the initial five-, seven-, or 10-year term. In addition, our multifamily loans may contain an initial interest-only period which typically does not exceed two years; however, these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis. Loans that we have purchased typically adjust to different market rate indexes. 
 In underwriting multifamily real estate loans, we consider a number of factors, including the ratio of the projected net cash flow to the loan s debt service requirement (generally requiring a minimum ratio of 120 , computed after deduction for a vacancy factor and property expenses we deem appropriate), the age and condition of the collateral, the financial resources and income of the sponsor, and the sponsor s experience in owning or managing similar properties. Multifamily real estate loans generally are originated in amounts up to the lesser of 75 of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property securing the loan. We require title insurance, fire and extended coverage casualty insurance, and, if required, flood insurance up to the regulatory required maximum in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property. Although a significant portion of our multifamily real estate loans are referred to us by third-party loan brokers, we underwrite all multifamily real estate loans in accordance with our underwriting standards. Due to competitor considerations, as is customary in our marketplace, we typically do not obtain personal guarantees of the principals on multifamily real estate loans, except when warranted. 
 The repayment of loans secured by multifamily real estate properties typically depends on the successful operation of the property. If the cash flow from the property is reduced, or interest payments on the loan increase, the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired.

 Commercial Real Estate Loans. Commercial real estate loans (other than multifamily real estate loans) totaled 899.2 million, or 21.2 of our loan portfolio, as of December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, our commercial real estate loan portfolio consisted of 726 loans with an average loan balance of approximately 1.2 million, although there are a large number of loans with balances substantially greater than this average. At December 31, 2022, our largest commercial real estate loan had a principal balance of 80.0 million (net active principal balance of 26.7 million as we have a 33.3 participation interest), was secured by an office facility located in Staten Island, New York, and was performing in accordance with its original contractual terms. Substantially all of our commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in our primary market areas. 
 The following table sets forth the property types collateralizing our commercial real estate loans held-for-investment as of December 31, 2022: 
 December 31, 2022 
 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Mixed use (majority of space is non-residential) 186,933 20.8 Office buildings 242,106 26.9 Retail 153,219 17.0 Accommodations (hotel/motel) 47,313 5.3 Warehousing 106,149 11.8 Healthcare facilities 13,133 1.5 Services 38,917 4.3 Restaurants 11,428 1.3 Schools/daycare 15,368 1.7 Recreational 10,052 1.1 Manufacturing 43,923 4.9 Other 30,708 3.4 899,249 100.0 
 Our commercial real estate loans typically amortize over 20 to 25 years with negotiated interest rates that adjust after an initial five-, seven-, or 10-year period, and every five years thereafter. Adjustable-rate loan originations are generally tied to a specifically identified market rate index. We also originate, to a lesser extent, 10- to 15-year fixed-rate, fully amortizing loans. In general, our commercial real estate loans have interest rate floors equal to the interest rate on the date the loan is originated, and generally have prepayment penalties if the loan is repaid in the initial five-, seven-, or 10-year term. Loans that we have purchased typically adjust to different market indexes.

In underwriting commercial real estate loans, we generally lend up to the lesser of 75 of either the property s appraised value or purchase price. Our policies permit the origination of certain single-use property types but at lower loan-to-appraised value ratios. We base our decision to lend primarily on the economic viability of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower. In evaluating a proposed commercial real estate loan, we emphasize the ratio of the property s projected net cash flow to the loan s debt service requirement (generally requiring a minimum ratio of 125 , computed after deduction for a vacancy factor and property expenses we deem appropriate). Personal guarantees of the principals are typically obtained. We require title insurance, fire and extended coverage casualty insurance, and, if appropriate, flood insurance up to the regulatory required maximum amount in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property. Although a significant portion of our commercial real estate loans were referred to us by third-party loan brokers, we underwrite all commercial real estate loans in accordance with our underwriting standards. 
 Commercial real estate loans generally carry higher interest rates than multifamily residential real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans also generally have greater credit risk compared to multifamily residential real estate loans, as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Changes in economic conditions that are not in the control of the borrower or lender may affect the value of the collateral for the loan or the future cash flow of the property. Additionally, any decline in real estate values may be more pronounced for commercial real estate than for multifamily residential properties. 
 Construction and Land Loans. At December 31, 2022, construction and land loans totaled 24.9 million, or 0.6 of total loans receivable, and the additional unadvanced portion of these construction loans totaled 22.6 million. At December 31, 2022, we had 28 construction and land loans with an average balance of approximately 893,000. Our largest construction and land loan had a principal balance of 3.8 million, and is secured by a proposed three-story, 72-unit apartment building in Staten Island, New York. At December 31, 2022, this loan was performing in accordance with its original contractual terms. 
 Our construction and land loans typically are interest-only loans with interest rates that are tied to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal. Margins generally range from zero to 200 basis points above the prime rate. We also originate, to a lesser extent, 10- to 15-year fixed-rate, fully amortizing land loans. In general, our construction and land loans have interest rate floors equal to the interest rate on the date the loan is originated, and we do not typically charge prepayment penalties. 
 We grant construction and land loans to experienced developers for the construction of single-family residences, including condominiums, and commercial properties. Construction and land loans also are made to individuals for the construction of their personal residences. Advances on construction loans are made in accordance with a schedule reflecting the cost of construction, but are generally limited to a loan-to-completed appraised value ratio of 70 . Repayment of construction loans on residential properties normally is expected from the sale of units to individual purchasers, or in the case of individuals building their own residences, with a permanent mortgage. In the case of income-producing property, repayment usually is expected from permanent financing upon completion of construction. We typically offer permanent mortgage financing on our construction loans only on income-producing properties. 
 Land loans also help finance the purchase of land intended for future development, including single-family housing, multifamily housing, and commercial property. In some cases, we may make an acquisition loan before the borrower has received municipal approvals to develop the land. In general, the maximum loan-to-value ratio for land acquisition loans is 50 of the appraised value of the property, and the maximum term of these loans is three years. Generally, if the maturity of the loan exceeds three years, the loan must be an amortizing loan. 
 Construction and land loans generally carry higher interest rates and have shorter terms than multifamily and commercial real estate loans. Construction and land loans have greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, income-producing real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the project at completion of construction as compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction costs is inaccurate, we may decide to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property. However, if the estimated value of the completed project is inaccurate, the borrower may hold the real estate with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the construction loan upon its sale. In the event we make a land acquisition loan on real estate that is not yet approved for the planned development, there is a risk that approvals will not be granted or will be delayed. Construction loans also expose us to a risk that improvements will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs. In addition, the ultimate sale or rental of the project may not occur as anticipated and the market value of collateral, when completed, may be less than the outstanding loans and there may be no permanent financing available upon completion. Substantially all of our construction and land loans are secured by real estate located in our primary market areas.

Commercial and Industrial Loans . At December 31, 2022, commercial and industrial loans totaled 154.7 million or 3.6 of the total loan portfolio, and the additional unadvanced portion of these commercial and industrial loans totaled 108.6 million. As of December 31, 2022, we had 921 commercial and industrial loans with an average loan balance of approximately 168,000, although we originate these types of loans in amounts substantially greater than this average. At December 31, 2022, our largest commercial and industrial loan had a principal balance of 13.4 million and was performing in accordance with its original contractual terms. 
 Our term commercial and industrial loans typically amortize over five to seven years with interest rates that are primarily indexed to various FHLB rates, and to a lesser extent, prime rates. Margins generally range from zero to 300 basis points above the index rate. We also originate, to a lesser extent, 10-year fixed-rate, fully amortizing loans. In general, our commercial and industrial loans have interest rate floors equal to the interest rate on the date the loan is originated and have prepayment penalties. 
 We make various types of secured and unsecured commercial and industrial loans for the purpose of working capital and other general business purposes. The terms of these loans generally range from less than one year to a maximum of seven years, however we could allow for a maximum of 10 years depending on industry or asset type. The loans either are negotiated on a fixed-rate basis or carry adjustable interest rates indexed to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal. 
 Commercial credit decisions are based on our credit assessment of the applicant. We evaluate the applicant s ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms of the loan and assess the risks involved. Personal guarantees of the principals are typically obtained. In addition to evaluating the loan applicant s financial statements, we consider the adequacy of the secondary sources of repayment for the loan, such as pledged collateral and the financial stability of the guarantors. Credit agency reports of each guarantor s personal credit history supplement our analysis of the applicant s creditworthiness. We also attempt to confirm with other banks and conduct trade investigations as part of our credit assessment of the borrower. Collateral securing a loan also is analyzed to determine its marketability. 
 Commercial and industrial loans generally carry higher interest rates than multifamily and commercial real estate loans of like maturity because they have a higher risk of default since their repayment generally depends on the successful operation of the borrowers business. 
 During 2020 and 2021 the Company participated in the PPP which was designed by the U.S. Treasury under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act of 2020 (the CARES Act to provide loans for small businesses to cover eligible payroll, utilities, rent and interest for a period of time during the COVID-19 pandemic. The loans are fully guaranteed by the Small Business Administration SBA and are forgivable provided the funds were used on qualifying payrolls costs, rent utilities and other qualifying payments. The loans bear a fixed rate of 1.0 and loan payments were deferred through the date that the SBA remits the borrower s loan forgiveness amount to the lender. The program has largely been completed, with substantially all of the borrowers receiving forgiveness payments. The Company originated 2,343 PPP loans totaling approximately 232.2 million under the PPP. At December 31, 2022, the Company had eight PPP loans outstanding totaling 5.1 million. 
 One-to-Four Family Residential Real Estate Loans. At December 31, 2022, we had 539 one-to-four family residential real estate loans outstanding with an aggregate balance of 173.9 million, or 4.1 of our total loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2022, the average balance of one-to-four family residential real estate loans was approximately 322,000, although we have originated these types of loan in amounts substantially greater than this average. At December 31, 2022, our largest loan of this type (excluding purchased loan pools, discussed below) had a principal balance of 5.4 million and was collateralized by 42 condominiums within a complex in Union County, New Jersey. The loan was performing in accordance with its original contractual terms. We no longer offer loans secured by owner-occupied, one-to-four family residential real estate, but may purchase them from time-to-time to meet our Community Reinvestment Act obligations. 
 Historically, we have not offered interest-only mortgage loans on one-to-four family residential real estate properties, where the borrower pays interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan. However, since 2014 we have purchased pools of one-to-four family residential real estate loans, a substantial amount of which are interest-only mortgage loans. We also historically have not offered loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as Option ARM loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan.

Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. At December 31, 2022, we had 2,281 home equity loans and lines of credit with an aggregate outstanding balance of 152.6 million, or 3.6 of our total loan portfolio. Of this total, outstanding home equity lines of credit totaled 73.1 million, or 1.7 , of our total loan portfolio and home equity loans totaled 75.4 million, or 1.8 , of our total loan portfolio. At December 31, 2022, the average home equity loan and line of credit balance was approximately 67,000 although we originate these types of loans in amounts substantially greater than this average. At December 31, 2022, our largest home equity line of credit had an outstanding balance of approximately 2.0 million. This loan was performing in accordance with its original contractual terms. At December 31, 2022, our largest outstanding home equity loan was 1.8 million and was performing in accordance with its original contractual terms. 
 We offer home equity loans and home equity lines of credit that are secured by the borrower s primary residence or second home. Home equity lines of credit are adjustable-rate loans tied to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal adjusted for a margin, and have a maximum term of 25 years during which time the borrower is required to make principal payments based on a 30-year amortization. Home equity lines generally have interest rate floors and ceilings. The borrower is permitted to draw against the line during the entire term on originations occurring prior to June 15, 2011. For home equity loans originated beginning on June 15, 2011, the borrower is only permitted to draw against the line for the initial 10 years. Our home equity loans typically are fully amortizing with fixed terms up to 25 years. Home equity loans and lines of credit generally are underwritten with the same criteria we historically used to underwrite fixed-rate, one-to-four family residential real estate loans. Home equity loans and lines of credit may be underwritten with a loan-to-value ratio of 80 when combined with the principal balance of the existing mortgage loan. We appraise the property securing the loan at the time of the loan application to determine the value of the property. At the time we close a home equity loan or line of credit, we record a mortgage to perfect our security interest in the underlying collateral. 
 New York City Local Law 97 Local Law 97 became effective on November 15, 2019 as a subset of the Climate Mobilization Act passed by the New York City council in April 2019. The law sets limits on the greenhouse gas emissions of both newly built and existing covered buildings to help New York City reach the goal of a 40 reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from buildings by the year 2030, and 80 percent reduction in citywide emissions by calendar year 2050. The law will apply to both commercial and residential buildings over 25,000 square feet (or two more buildings on the same tax lot or governed by the same board of managers that together exceed 50,000 square feet) and goes into effect beginning 2024 with three time stages of implementation which have different amounts of permissible carbon emissions. The buildings covered by Local Law 97 will be required to file a report with the Department of Buildings by May 1, 2025 detailing their annual greenhouse gas emissions and then by May 1 of every year after. Starting in 2025, an owner of a covered building who submits a report indicating that their building exceeded its annual building emissions limit will be liable for a civil penalty. Based on management s assessment of our loan portfolio, we believe that 19 loans will be affected by the ruling regarding Local Law 97 during the first stage of implementation. At December 31, 2022, the highest Loan-to-Value LTV ratio of these 19 loans was 79.1 , and the average LTV ratio was 52.9 . These loans had an aggregate book balance of 82.6 million and were all performing in accordance with their original contractual terms at that date. 
 PCD Loans . The Company adopted CECL using the prospective transition approach for PCD loans that were previously classified as PCI loans and accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-30 - Accounting for Purchased Loans with Deteriorated Credit Quality ("ASC 310-30"). In accordance with the standard, management did not reassess whether PCI loans met the criteria of PCD loans as of the date of adoption. On January 1, 2021, the amortized cost basis of the PCD assets was adjusted to reflect the addition of the 6.8 million of the allowance for credit losses. The remaining noncredit discount (based on the adjusted amortized cost basis) was accreted into interest income at the effective interest rate as of January 1, 2021. 
 Upon adoption of CECL, the Company elected to maintain pools of loans that were previously accounted for under ASC 310-30 and will continue to account for these pools as a unit of account. Loans are only removed from existing pools if they are written off, paid off, or sold. Upon adoption of CECL, the allowance for credit losses was determined for each pool and added to the pool's carrying amount to establish a new amortized cost basis. The difference between the unpaid principal balance of the pool and the new amortized cost basis is the noncredit premium or discount which will be amortized into interest income over the remaining life of the pool. Changes to the allowance for credit losses after adoption are recorded through provision expense. 
 At December 31, 2022, PCD loans consisted of approximately 9 one-to-four family residential loans, 28 commercial real estate loans, 53 commercial and industrial loans, and 10 in home equity loans. At December 31, 2021, PCD loans consisted of approximately 16 one-to-four family residential loans, 25 commercial real estate loans, 48 commercial and industrial loans, and 11 in construction and land and home equity loans.

Non-Performing and Problem Assets 
 When a loan is between 10 to 15 days delinquent, we generally send the borrower a late charge notice. When a loan is 30 days past due, we generally mail the borrower a letter reminding the borrower of the delinquency and, except for loans secured by one-to-four family residential real estate, we attempt personal contact with the borrower to determine the reason for the delinquency, to ensure the borrower correctly understands the terms of the loan, and to emphasize the importance of making payments on or before the due date. If necessary, additional late charges and delinquency notices are issued and the account will be monitored. After 90 days of delinquency, we generally send the borrower a final demand for payment and refer the loan to legal counsel to commence foreclosure and related legal proceedings. At times, we may shorten or lengthen these time frames. 
 Generally, loans (excluding PCD loans) are placed on non-accrual status when payment of principal or interest is 90 days or more delinquent unless the loan is considered well-secured and in the process of collection. Loans also are placed on non-accrual status at any time if the ultimate collection of principal or interest in full is in doubt. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is reversed, and further income is recognized only to the extent received, and only if the principal balance is deemed fully collectible. The loan may be returned to accrual status if both principal and interest payments are brought current and factors indicating doubtful collection no longer exist, including performance by the borrower under the loan terms for a consecutive six-month period. Our Chief Credit Officer reports monitored loans, including all loans rated watch, special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss, to the Loan Committee of the Board of Directors at least quarterly. 
 To minimize our losses on delinquent loans we work with borrowers experiencing financial difficulties and will consider modifying existing loan terms and conditions that we would not otherwise consider, commonly referred to as troubled debt restructurings TDRs ). We record an impairment loss associated with TDRs, if any, based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the original loan s effective interest rate or the underlying collateral value, less estimated cost to sell, if the loan is collateral dependent. Once an obligation has been restructured because of credit problems, it continues to be considered restructured until paid in full or, if the obligation yields a market rate (a rate equal to or greater than the rate we were willing to accept at the time of the restructuring for a new loan with comparable risk), until the year after which the restructuring takes place, provided the borrower has performed under the modified terms for a consecutive six-month period. 
 The Company introduced a short-term modification program in March 2020 that provided temporary payment relief to those borrowers directly impacted by COVID-19. The program allowed for a deferral of payments for 90 days, which could be extended for an additional 90 days, with modifications in the form of payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment. In accordance with regulatory guidance under the CARES Act, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, and other regulatory guidance, these loan deferrals were not considered TDRs and not reported as past due during the deferral period. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no material deferrals related to the CARES Act.

 At December 31, 2022, 6.8 of PCD loans were past due 30 to 89 days, and 23.0 were past due 90 days or more. At December 31, 2021, 10.5 of PCD loans were past due 30 to 89 days, and 19.2 were past due 90 days or more. At December 31, 2020, 9.6 of PCI loans were past due 30 to 89 days, and 35.2 were past due 90 days or more. 
 The following table sets forth the property types collateralizing non-accrual commercial real estate loans held-for investment at December 31, 2022:

Other Real Estate Owned . Real estate acquired by us as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned. On the date the property is acquired, it is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, establishing a new cost basis. Estimated fair value generally represents the sale price a buyer would be willing to pay on the basis of current market conditions, including normal terms from other financial institutions, less the estimated costs to sell the property. Holding costs and declines in estimated fair value result in charges to expense after acquisition. At December 31, 2022, the Company had no assets acquired through foreclosure. At December 31, 2021, other real estate owned was comprised of one property located in New Jersey, which had a carrying value of approximately 100,000, and which was sold during the second quarter of 2022 for an immaterial gain. 
 Potential Problem Loans and Classification of Assets . Our relationship managers and credit administration department monitor their loan portfolios, including evaluations of borrowers business operations, current financial condition, underlying values of any collateral, and assessment of their financial prospects in the current economic environment. Based on these evaluations, we determine an appropriate strategy for individual potential problem loans, with the objective of maximizing the recovery of the related loan balances. 
 Our policies, consistent with regulatory guidelines, provide for the classification of loans and other assets that are considered to be of lesser quality as substandard, doubtful, or loss assets. An asset is classified substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those assets characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets (or portions of assets) classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted. Assets that do not expose us to risk sufficient to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but which possess potential weaknesses that deserve our close attention, are designated as special mention. At December 31, 2022, classified assets, excluding loans on non-accrual status, consisted of substandard assets of 30.1 million and no doubtful or loss assets. At December 31, 2022, we also had 7.0 million of assets designated as special mention. At December 31, 2021, classified assets, excluding loans on non-accrual status, consisted of substandard assets of 51.1 million and no doubtful or loss assets. At December 31, 2021, we also had 13.8 million of assets designated as special mention. 
 Our determination as to the classification of our assets (and the amount of our loss allowances) is subject to review by our principal federal regulator, the OCC, which can require that we adjust our classification and related loss allowances. We regularly review our asset portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. We also engage the services of a third party to review, on a sample basis, our risk ratings on a semi-annual basis. 
 The following table sets forth the total amounts of delinquencies for accruing loans that were 30 to 89 days past due by type and by amount at the dates indicated:

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 
 We provide for credit losses on loans based on the consistent application of our documented allowance for credit losses methodology. Credit losses are charged to the allowance for credit losses and recoveries are credited to it. Additions to the allowance for credit losses are provided by charges against income based on various factors, which, in our judgment, deserve current recognition in estimating probable losses. Credit losses are charged-off in the period the loans, or portion thereof, are deemed uncollectible. Generally, the Company will record a loan charge-off (including a partial charge-off) to reduce a loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, less cost to sell, for collateral dependent loans. We regularly review the loan portfolio in order to maintain the allowance for credit losses in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Polices - Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans for a description of our allowance methodology.

Investments 
 We conduct securities portfolio transactions in accordance with our board-approved investment policy. Northfield Bank's investment policy is reviewed at least annually by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. Any changes to the policy are subject to ratification by the full Board of Directors. This policy dictates that investment decisions give consideration to the safety of the investment, liquidity requirements, potential returns, the ability to provide collateral for pledging requirements, and consistency with our interest rate risk management strategy. Our Chief Investment Officer executes our securities portfolio transactions, within policy requirements, with the approval of either the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer. NSB Services Corp. s and NSB Realty Trust s (which are each Bank subsidiaries) investment officers execute security portfolio transactions in accordance with investment policies that substantially mirror Northfield Bank s investment policy. All purchase and sale transactions are reviewed by the Risk Committee at least quarterly. 
 Our current investment policy permits investments in mortgage-backed securities, including pass-through securities and real estate mortgage investment conduits REMICs ). The investment policy also permits, with certain limitations, investments in debt securities issued by the U.S. Government, agencies of the U.S. Government or U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises GSEs ), asset-backed securities, municipal obligations (including bonds, tax anticipation notes and bond anticipation notes), money market mutual funds, federal funds, investment grade corporate bonds, subordinated debt, reverse repurchase agreements, and certificates of deposit. 
 Northfield Bank s investment policy does not permit investment in common stock of other entities including GSEs, other than our required investment in the common stock of the FHLBNY or as permitted for community reinvestment purposes or to fund Northfield Bank s deferred compensation plan. Northfield Bancorp, Inc. may invest in equity securities of other financial institutions, as well as preferred stock, up to certain limitations. As of December 31, 2022, we did not hold any asset-backed securities other than mortgage-backed securities. Our Board of Directors may change these limitations in the future. 
 Our current investment policy does permit hedging through the use of derivative instruments such as financial futures or interest rate options and swaps, although we currently have no derivative hedging instruments in place. 
 At the time of purchase, we designate a security as either held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading, based upon our ability and intent to hold such securities. Trading securities and securities available-for-sale are reported at estimated fair value, and securities held-to-maturity are reported at amortized cost. A periodic review and evaluation of the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolios is conducted to determine if the estimated fair value of any security has declined below its carrying value and whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. If such impairment is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss is charged against earnings. The estimated fair values of our securities are obtained from an independent nationally recognized pricing service. At December 31, 2022, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by GSEs, U.S. Government agency securities, corporate debt securities, and, to a lesser extent, municipal bonds, private label mortgage-backed securities, and mutual funds. The market for these securities primarily consists of other financial institutions, insurance companies, real estate investment trusts, and mutual funds. 
 We purchase mortgage-backed securities insured or guaranteed primarily by the Federal National Mortgage Association Fannie Mae ), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac ), or the Government National Mortgage Association Ginnie Mae ), and to a lesser extent, securities issued by private companies (private label). We invest in mortgage-backed securities to achieve positive interest rate spreads with minimal administrative expense, and to lower our credit risk as a result of the guarantees provided by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae as well as to provide us liquidity to fund loan originations and deposit outflows. In 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency placed Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae into conservatorship. The U.S. Treasury Department has established financing agreements to ensure that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae meet their obligations to holders of mortgage-backed securities that they have issued or guaranteed. 
 Mortgage-backed securities are securities sold in the secondary market that are collateralized by pools of mortgages. Certain types of mortgage-backed securities are commonly referred to as pass-through certificates because the principal and interest of the underlying loans is passed through pro rata to investors, net of certain costs, including servicing and guarantee fees, in proportion to an investor s ownership in the entire pool. The issuers of such securities pool mortgages and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors. The interest rate on the security is lower than the interest rates on the underlying loans to allow for payment of servicing and guaranty fees. Ginnie Mae, a U.S. Government agency, and GSEs, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, may guarantee the payments, or guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest to investors. 
 18 

Mortgage-backed securities are more liquid than individual mortgage loans since there is a more active market for such securities. In addition, mortgage-backed securities may be used to collateralize our specific liabilities and obligations. Investments in mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by GSEs involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. We periodically review current prepayment speeds to determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause adjustment of amortization or accretion. 
 REMICs are a type of mortgage-backed security issued by special purpose entities that aggregate pools of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities and create different classes of securities with varying maturities and amortization schedules, as well as a residual interest, with each class possessing different risk characteristics. The cash flows from the underlying collateral are generally divided into tranches or classes that have descending priorities with respect to the distribution of principal and interest cash flows. 
 The timely payment of principal and interest on these REMICs is generally supported (credit enhanced) in varying degrees by either insurance issued by a financial guarantee insurer, letters of credit, over collateralization, or subordination techniques. Privately issued REMICs and pass-throughs can be subject to certain credit-related risks normally not associated with U.S. Government agency and GSE mortgage-backed securities. The loss protection generally provided by the various forms of credit enhancements is limited, and losses in excess of certain levels are not protected. Furthermore, the credit enhancement itself is subject to the creditworthiness of the credit enhancer. Thus, in the event a credit enhancer does not fulfill its obligations, the holder could be subject to risk of loss similar to a purchaser of a whole loan pool. Management believes that the credit enhancements are adequate to protect us from material losses on our private label mortgage-backed securities investments. 
 At December 31, 2022, our corporate bond portfolio consisted of securities, all of which were investment-grade, and had remaining maturities generally shorter than five years. Our investment policy provides that we may invest up to 15 of our Tier 1 risk-based capital in corporate bonds from individual issuers which, at the time of purchase, are within the investment-grade ratings from Standard Poor s, Moody s or Fitch. The maturity of these bonds may not exceed 10 years, and there is no aggregate limit for this security type. Corporate bonds from individual issuers not rated investment grade at the time of purchase, are limited to the lesser of 1 of our total assets or 15 of our Tier 1 risk-based capital, and must have a maturity of less than one year. Aggregate holdings of this security type cannot exceed 5 of our total assets. Aggregate holdings of individual issuers of corporate bonds and commercial paper, both investment grade and non-investment grade, are not to exceed 50 of Tier 1 capital of the Company. Additionally, at the time of purchase, management performs due diligence to conclude that the security meets the regulatory standard for investment grade. Bonds that subsequently experience a decline in credit rating below investment grade are monitored at least quarterly.

Sources of Funds 
 General. Deposits traditionally have been our primary source of funds for our securities and lending activities. We also borrow from the FHLBNY and other financial institutions to supplement cash flow needs, to manage the maturities of liabilities for interest rate and investment risk management purposes, and to manage our cost of funds. Our additional sources of funds are the proceeds of loan sales, scheduled loan and investment payments, maturing investments, loan prepayments, brokered deposits, and stockholders' equity, including retained earnings. 
 Deposits. We accept deposits primarily from the areas in which our offices are located. We rely on our convenient locations, customer service, and competitive products and pricing to attract and retain deposits. We offer a variety of deposit accounts to businesses, consumers and municipalities with a range of interest rates and terms. Our deposit accounts consist of transaction accounts (NOW and interest and non-interest bearing checking accounts), savings accounts (money market, passbook, and statement savings), and certificates of deposit, including individual retirement accounts. We accept brokered deposits when it is deemed cost effective. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had brokered deposits totaling 390.0 million and 31.0 million, respectively. In addition, municipal deposits which primarily consist of funds from local government entities domiciled in New Jersey, and are a significant source of funds, totaled 604.7 million, or 14.6 of our total deposits at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2021, municipal deposits totaled 633.5 million, or 15.2 of our total deposits. Municipal deposits are primarily secured by mortgaged-backed securities. 
 Uninsured deposits were estimated at 1.54 billion and 1.64 billion at December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. As of those dates we had no deposits that were uninsured for any reason other than being in excess of the 250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance.

We sponsor a 401(k) plan, which provides eligible employees the opportunity to invest a portion of their pre-tax and after-tax base salary, up to regulatory limits, in professionally managed investment options, and self-directed brokerage accounts. Over time, we match up to 50 of employee contributions up to the first 6 of compensation, as defined, based on years of service. We also maintain the Northfield Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the ESOP for eligible employees. The ESOP is a tax-qualified plan invested in our common stock.

 Employee Engagement . We partner with various third parties to measure employee engagement and satisfaction, and through efforts of our internal employee engagement team, develop action plans for continued improvement. We have introduced virtual town hall meetings for all employees, opening the lines of communications and answering employee questions and concerns. In conjunction with the town hall meetings, internal focus groups, and employee engagement chats, periodically surveys are completed related to well-being, compensation, benefits, and our core values. These surveys provided insight into our employees needs and preferences, which we consider in future program development.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 
 General 
 Northfield Bank is a federally chartered savings bank that is regulated, examined, and supervised by the OCC and the FDIC. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC s Deposit Insurance Fund and depositors, and not for the protection of security holders. Under this system of federal regulation, financial institutions are periodically examined to ensure that they satisfy applicable standards with respect to their capital adequacy, assets, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market interest rates. Northfield Bank also is regulated to a lesser extent by the FRB, governing reserves to be maintained against deposits and other matters, including payments of dividends. The OCC examines Northfield Bank and prepares reports for the consideration of its Board of Directors on any operating deficiencies. Northfield Bank s relationship with its depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by federal law and, to a much lesser extent, state law, especially in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of Northfield Bank s loan documents. Northfield Bank is also a member of and owns stock in the FHLBNY, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the FHLB System. 
 As a savings and loan holding company, Northfield Bancorp, Inc. is required to comply with the rules and regulations of the FRB. It is required to file certain reports with and is subject to examination by and the enforcement authority of the FRB. Northfield Bancorp, Inc. is also subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC under the federal securities laws. 
 Any change in applicable laws or regulations, whether by the FDIC, the OCC, the FRB, the SEC, or Congress, could have a material adverse effect on Northfield Bancorp, Inc. and Northfield Bank and their operations. 
 Set forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to Northfield Bank and Northfield Bancorp, Inc. The description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Northfield Bank and Northfield Bancorp, Inc. 
 Business Activities 
 A federal savings bank derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners Loan Act, as amended, and the regulations of the OCC. Under these laws and regulations, Northfield Bank may originate mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial business loans, and consumer loans, and it may invest in certain types of debt securities and certain other assets. Certain types of lending, such as commercial and consumer loans, are subject to aggregate limits calculated as a specified percentage of Northfield Bank s capital or assets. Northfield Bank also may establish subsidiaries that may engage in a variety of activities, including some that are not otherwise permissible for Northfield Bank, including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage. 
 Loans-to-One-Borrower 
 We generally may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15 of Northfield Bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, equal to 10 of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which is defined to include certain financial instruments and bullion, but generally does not include real estate. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with our loans-to-one-borrower limitations. 
 Qualified Thrift Lender Test 
 As a federally chartered savings bank, Northfield Bank is required to satisfy a qualified thrift lender QTL test, under which we either must qualify as a domestic building and loan association as defined by the Internal Revenue Code or maintain at least 65 of our portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments. Qualified thrift investments consist primarily of residential mortgages and related investments, including mortgage-backed and related securities. Portfolio assets generally mean total assets less specified liquid assets up to 20 of total assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets and the value of property used to conduct business. A savings bank that fails the QTL test must operate under specified restrictions. Federal law also makes noncompliance with the QTL test subject to agency enforcement action for a violation of law. As of December 31, 2022, we maintained 77.8 of our portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments and, therefore, we met the QTL test. 
 
 26 

Standards for Safety and Soundness 
 Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe for insured depository institutions under its jurisdiction standards relating to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, employee compensation, and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. The federal banking agencies adopted Interagency Guidelines Prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement the safety and soundness standards required under federal law. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan, the appropriate federal banking agency may issue an enforceable order requiring correction of the deficiencies. 
 Capital Requirements 
 Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5 , a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0 , a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0 , and a 4.0 Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. 
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. Common equity Tier 1 capital generally is defined as common stockholders equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital generally is defined as common equity Tier 1 plus additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25 of risk-weighted assets and certain other items. In assessing an institution s capital adequacy, the OCC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative adjustments as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions when deemed necessary. 
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5 of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. 
 The federal banking agencies, including the OCC, are required to specify for qualifying institutions with less than 10 billion of assets, an alternative community bank leverage ratio that ranges between 8 to 10 of consolidated assets. Institutions with capital levels meeting or exceeding the specified requirement and choosing the alternative regulatory capital framework are considered to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including all risk-based requirements. The elective community bank leverage ratio has been currently established at 9.0 Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets. Eligible institutions may opt into and out of the community bank ratio framework on their quarterly call report. Northfield Bank elected to opt into the new framework effective March 31, 2020. 
 As of December 31, 2022, Northfield Bancorp, Inc. and Northfield Bank exceeded all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject. Further, the most recent OCC notification categorized the Bank as a well-capitalized institution under the prompt corrective action regulations discussed below. See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion about Regulatory Requirements. 
 27 

Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action 
 Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulators take prompt corrective action with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For this purpose, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. Under the applicable regulations, an institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0 or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5 or greater. An institution is adequately capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0 or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5 or greater. An institution is undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 , a leverage ratio of less than 4.0 or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5 . An institution is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0 , a leverage ratio of less than 3.0 or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0 . An institution is considered to be critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0 . 
 The regulations provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OCC within 45 days of the date a savings institution receives notice that it is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. Any holding company for the savings institution required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of an amount equal to 5.0 of the savings institution s assets at the time it was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by the OCC, or the amount necessary to restore the savings institution to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the OCC notifies the savings institution that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters, and the OCC has the authority to require payment and collect payment under the guarantee. Various restrictions, including on growth and capital distributions, also apply to undercapitalized institutions. If an undercapitalized institution fails to submit an acceptable capital plan, it is treated as significantly undercapitalized. Significantly undercapitalized institutions must comply with one or more additional restrictions including, but not limited to, an order by the OCC to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss officers or directors and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. The OCC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. 
 The previously referenced final rule that establishes an elective community bank leverage ratio provides that a qualifying institution whose Tier 1 capital equals or exceeds the specified community bank leverage ratio and opts into that framework will be considered to be well capitalized for purposes of prompt corrective action. 
 Capital Distributions 
 Federal regulations restrict capital distributions by savings institutions. For purposes of the regulations, capital distributions generally include cash dividends and other transactions charged to the capital account of a savings institution. A federal savings institution must file an application with the OCC for approval of the capital distribution if: 
 the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceeds the sum of the institution s net income for that year to date plus the institution s retained net income for the preceding two years that is still available for dividend; 
 the institution would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution; 
 the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or written regulatory condition; or 
 the institution is not eligible for expedited review of its filings (i.e., generally, institutions that do not have safety and soundness, compliance and Community Reinvestment Act ratings in the top two categories or fail a capital requirement). 
 A savings institution that is a subsidiary of a holding company, which is the case with Northfield Bank, must file a notice with the FRB at least 30 days before the Board of Directors declares any dividend and receives FRB non-objection to the payment of the dividend. 
 Applications or notices may be denied if the institution will be undercapitalized after the proposed dividend, the proposed dividend raises safety and soundness concerns or the proposed dividend would violate a law, regulation enforcement order, or regulatory condition. 
 28 

In the event that a savings institution s capital falls below its regulatory requirements or it is notified by the regulatory agency that it is in need of more than normal supervision, its ability to make capital distributions would be restricted. In addition, any proposed capital distribution could be prohibited if the regulatory agency determines that the distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. 
 Transactions with Related Parties 
 A savings institution s authority to engage in transactions with related parties or affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulation, FRB Regulation W. The term affiliate generally means any company that controls or is under common control with an institution, including Northfield Bancorp, Inc. and its non-savings institution subsidiaries (although certain subsidiaries of the institution itself are not considered affiliates). Applicable law limits the aggregate amount of covered transactions with any individual affiliate, including loans to the affiliate, to 10 of the capital and surplus of the savings institution. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20 of the savings institution s capital and surplus. Certain covered transactions with affiliates, such as loans to or guarantees issued on behalf of affiliates, are required to be secured by specified amounts of collateral. Purchasing low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited. Regulation W also provides that transactions with affiliates, including covered transactions, must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. In addition, savings institutions are prohibited by law from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and no savings institution may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary. 
 Authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10 or greater shareholders (insiders), as well as entities controlled by insiders, is governed by Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulation, FRB Regulation O. Among other things, loans to insiders must be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for bank-wide lending programs that do not discriminate in favor of insiders. Regulation O also places individual and aggregate limits on the amount of loans that may be made to insiders based, in part, on the institution s capital position, and requires that certain prior board approval procedures be followed. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be made. At December 31, 2022, Northfield Bank was in compliance with these regulations. 
 Enforcement 
 The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings institutions, including the authority to bring enforcement action against institution-related parties, including officers, directors, certain shareholders, and attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or "cease and desist" order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution, receivership, conservatorship or the termination of deposit insurance. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions. The maximum penalties that can be assessed are generally based on the type and severity of the violation, unsafe and unsound practice or other action, and are adjusted annually for inflation. 
 Deposit Insurance 
 Northfield Bank is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the FDIC. Deposit accounts in Northfield Bank are insured up to a maximum of 250,000 for each separately insured depositor by the FDIC. 
 The FDIC assesses insured depository institutions to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. Under the FDIC s risk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less risky pay lower assessments. Assessments for institutions with less than 10 billion of assets are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of an institution s failure within three years. 
 The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments and adopted a final rule in October 2022 to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by two basis points beginning in the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. As a result, effective January 1, 2023, assessment rates for institutions of Northfield Bank's size range from 2.5 to 42 basis points. Any significant future increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Northfield Bank. Future insurance assessments cannot be predicted. 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed in writing. Management of Northfield Bank does not know of any practice, condition, or violation that may lead to termination of the Northfield Bank s deposit insurance. 
 29 

Federal Home Loan Bank System 
 Northfield Bank is a member of the FHLBNY, and therefore is a member of the FHLB System, which consists of 11 regional FHLBs. The FHLB System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Members of the FHLB are required to acquire and hold a specified amount of shares of FHLB capital stock. Northfield Bank was in compliance with this requirement at December 31, 2022. 
 Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws 
 Savings institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. An institution s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on certain activities such as branching and acquisitions. On May 5, 2022, the OCC released a notice of proposed rulemaking to strengthen and modernize the Community Reinvestment Act regulations and framework. In the most recent Community Reinvestment Act Public Disclosure issued by the OCC as of March 9, 2020, Northfield Bank was rated Satisfactory. 
 Other Regulations 
 Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Northfield Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Northfield Bank s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the: 
 Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 
 Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, requiring that borrowers for mortgage loans for one-to-four family residential real estate receive various disclosures, including good faith estimates of settlement costs, lender servicing and escrow account practices, and prohibiting certain practices that increase the cost of settlement services; 
 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; 
 Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; 
 Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; 
 Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; 
 Flood Disaster Protection Act, requiring flood insurance of collateral properties located in designated flood zones; 
 Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, a program that provides a wide range of protections in lending for individuals entering, called to active duty in the military, or deployed service members; and 
 Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws. 
 30 

The operations of Northfield Bank also are subject to the: 
 Truth in Savings Act and Regulation DD, which requires disclosures of deposit terms to consumers; 
 Regulation CC, which relates to the availability of deposit funds to consumers; 
 Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; 
 Electronic Funds Transfer Act, which governs automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; 
 The USA PATRIOT Act, which requires banks and savings institutions to, among other things, establish broadened anti-money laundering compliance programs and due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such required compliance programs are intended to supplement pre-existing compliance requirements that apply to financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations; and 
 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties and requires all financial institutions offering products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution s privacy policy and allow such customers the opportunity to opt out of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties. 
 Holding Company Regulation 
 Northfield Bancorp, Inc. is a unitary savings and loan holding company subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB. The FRB has enforcement authority over Northfield Bancorp, Inc. and its non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, that authority permits the FRB to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a risk to Northfield Bank. 
 The business activities of savings and loan holding companies are generally limited to those activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, and certain additional activities authorized by Federal Reserve Board regulations, unless the holding company has elected financial holding company status. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting equity securities and insurance as well as activities that are incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. Northfield Bancorp Inc. has not elected financial holding company status. Federal law generally prohibits the acquisition of more than 5 of a class of voting stock of a company engaged in impermissible activities. 
 Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5 of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company without prior written approval of the FRB and from acquiring or retaining control of any depository institution not insured by the FDIC. In evaluating applications by savings and loan holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the FRB must consider such things as the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the institution, the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. An acquisition by a savings and loan holding company of a savings institution in another state to be held as a separate subsidiary may not be approved unless it is a supervisory acquisition under Section 13(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or the law of the state in which the target is located authorizes such acquisitions by out-of-state companies. 
 Savings and loan holding companies above 3 billion in consolidated assets, such as Northfield Bancorp, Inc., are subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements that are as stringent as those required for their insured depository subsidiaries. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary depository institutions (including the community bank leverage ratio alternative) also apply to savings and loan holding companies. Northfield Bancorp, Inc. exceeded the FRB s consolidated capital requirements as of December 31, 2022. 
 Federal law applies the FRB's source of strength doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The FRB has issued regulations implementing the source of strength policy that requires holding companies act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity, and other support in times of financial stress. 
 31 

The FRB has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank and savings and loan holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization s capital requirements, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory review of capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company s capital needs and overall financial condition. The guidance also provides for prior consultation with supervisory staff for material increases in the amount of a company s common stock dividend. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may also be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. Regulatory guidance specifies that a holding company should advise FRB supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common or perpetual preferred stock, to provide opportunity for supervisory review, and possible objection, when the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction as of the end of a quarter in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurs. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of Northfield Bancorp, Inc. to pay dividends, repurchase common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
 Federal Securities Laws 
 Northfield Bancorp, Inc. s common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Northfield Bancorp, Inc. is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions, and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. Northfield Bancorp, Inc. has policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 
 Change in Control Regulations 
 Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a savings and loan holding company, such as Northfield Bancorp, Inc., unless the FRB has been given 60 days prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under the Change in Bank Control Act, means ownership, control of or the power to vote 25 or more of any class of voting stock. Acquisition of more than 10 of any class of a savings and loan holding company s voting stock constitutes a rebuttable determination of control under the regulations under certain circumstances including where, as is the case with Northfield Bancorp, Inc., the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 Federal Taxation 
 General . Northfield Bank and Northfield Bancorp, Inc. are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. Northfield Bancorp, Inc.'s consolidated federal tax returns are not currently under audit. 
 The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Northfield Bancorp, Inc. or Northfield Bank. 
 Method of Accounting . For federal income tax purposes, Northfield Bancorp, Inc. currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal and state income tax returns. 
 Bad Debt Reserves . Historically, Northfield Bank was subject to special provisions in the tax law applicable to qualifying savings banks regarding allowable tax bad debt deductions and related reserves. Tax law changes were enacted in 1996 that eliminated the ability of savings banks to use the percentage of taxable income method for computing tax bad debt reserves for tax years after 1995, and required recapture into taxable income over a six-year period of all bad debt reserves accumulated after a savings bank s last tax year beginning before January 1, 1988. Northfield Bank recaptured its post December 31, 1987, bad-debt reserve balance over the six-year period ended December 31, 2004. Northfield Bancorp, Inc. is required to use the specific charge-off method to account for tax bad debt deductions. 
 32 

Taxable Distributions and Recapture . Prior to 1996, bad debt reserves created prior to 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income if Northfield Bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests or made certain distributions. Tax law changes in 1996 eliminated thrift-related recapture rules. However, under current law, pre-1988 tax bad debt reserves remain subject to recapture if Northfield Bank makes certain non-dividend distributions, repurchases any of its common stock, pays dividends in excess of earnings and profits, or fails to qualify as a bank for tax purposes. At December 31, 2022, the total federal pre-base year bad debt reserve of Northfield Bank was approximately 5.9 million. 
 Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction . Northfield Bancorp, Inc. may exclude from its federal taxable income 100 of dividends received from Northfield Bank as a wholly-owned subsidiary by filing consolidated tax returns. Through December 31, 2017, the corporate dividends-received deduction was 80 in the case of dividends received from a corporation in which a corporate recipient owns at least 20 of its stock, and corporations that own less than 20 of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend could deduct only 70 of dividends received or accrued on their behalf. Effective January 1, 2018, the dividends received deduction decreased from 80 to 65 and 70 to 50 for corporate recipients owning at least 20 or less than 20 , respectively, of a corporation s stock. 
 Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law on August 16, 2022, among other things, implements a new alternative minimum tax of 15 on corporations with profits in excess of 1 billion, a 1 excise tax on stock repurchases, and several tax incentives to promote clean energy and climate initiatives. These provisions are effective beginning January 1, 2023. 
 State Taxation 
 New York State Taxation. In 2014, New York State enacted significant and comprehensive reforms to its corporate tax system that went into effect January 1, 2015. The legislation resulted in significant changes to the method of calculating income taxes for banks, including changes to future period tax rates, rules relating to the sourcing of income, and the elimination of the banking corporation tax so that banking corporations are taxed under New York State s corporate franchise tax. The corporate franchise tax is based on the combined entire net income of the Company and its affiliates allocable and apportionable to New York State and taxed at a rate of 7.25 . New York State also imposes the Metropolitan Transportation Authority MTA Tax Surcharge allocable to business activities carried on in the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District. The MTA surcharge rate for 2022 was 30.0 , and will remain at 30.0 until otherwise adjusted. 
 New York City Taxation. Northfield Bank reports income on a calendar year basis to New York City and is subject to the New York City Financial Corporation Tax calculated, subject to a New York City income and expense allocation, on a similar basis as the New York State Tax, at a rate of 8.85 . 
 Our New York State tax returns are currently under audit for tax years 2015 through 2017. 
 New Jersey State Taxation. Northfield Bancorp, Inc. and Northfield Bank file New Jersey Corporation Business Tax returns on a calendar year basis. Generally, the income derived from New Jersey sources is subject to New Jersey tax. Northfield Bancorp, Inc. and Northfield Bank pay the greater of the corporate business tax at 9 of taxable income or the minimum tax of 2,000 per entity. On July 1, 2018, the State of New Jersey enacted new legislation that imposes a temporary surtax of 2.5 for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019, and of 1.5 for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021. On September 29, 2020, the state extended the 2.5 surtax through December 31, 2023, retroactively to tax years beginning January 1, 2020. The legislation also requires combined filing for certain members of an affiliated group for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2019. In May 2019, the State of New Jersey issued a tax technical bulletin, subsequently revised in December 2019, which gives guidance on the treatment of real estate investment trusts in connection with the combined reporting for New Jersey corporate business tax purposes. Real estate investment trusts and investment companies will be excluded from the combined group and will continue to file separate New Jersey tax returns.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference herein as well as in other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. See also, Forward-Looking Statements. 
 Risks Related to Our Lending Activities 
 The level of our commercial real estate loan portfolio subjects us to additional regulatory scrutiny. 
 The OCC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies have promulgated joint guidance on sound risk management practices for financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Under the guidance, a financial institution that, like us, is actively involved in commercial real estate lending should perform a risk assessment to identify concentrations. A financial institution may have a concentration in commercial real estate lending if, among other factors, (i) total reported loans for construction, land acquisition and development, and other land represent 100 or more of total capital, or (ii) total reported loans secured by multifamily and non-farm residential properties, loans for construction, land acquisition and development and other land, and loans otherwise sensitive to the general commercial real estate market, including loans to commercial real estate related entities, represent 300 or more of total capital. 
 Based on these factors we have a concentration in multifamily and commercial real estate lending, as such loans represent approximately 455.8 of Northfield Bank's capital as of December 31, 2022. The particular focus of the guidance is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be at greater risk to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The purpose of the guidance is to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The guidance states that management should employ heightened risk management practices including board and management oversight and strategic planning, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment, and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing. While we believe we have implemented policies and procedures with respect to our commercial real estate loan portfolio consistent with this guidance, bank regulators could require us to implement additional policies and procedures consistent with their interpretation of the guidance that may result in additional costs to us or that may result in a curtailment of our multifamily and commercial real estate lending and/or the requirement that we maintain higher levels of regulatory capital, either of which would adversely affect our loan originations and profitability. 
 Our concentration in multifamily loans and commercial real estate loans could expose us to increased lending risks and related credit losses. 
 Our current business strategy is to continue to originate multifamily loans and, to a lesser extent, other commercial real estate loans. At December 31, 2022, 3.72 billion, or 88.0 , of our loan portfolio held-for-investment, net, consisted of multifamily and other commercial real estate loans. 
 These types of loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the properties and the sale of such properties securing the loans. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Also, many of our borrowers have more than one of these types of loans outstanding. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one-to-four family residential real estate loan. 
 In addition, if loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled and the value of the real estate has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loan, which could cause us to increase our provision for credit losses and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 
 34 

Our New York State multifamily loan portfolio could be adversely impacted by changes in legislation or regulation. 
 On June 14, 2019, the New York State legislature passed the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, impacting about one million rent regulated apartment units. Among other things, the legislation: (i) curtails rent increases from material capital improvements and individual apartment improvements; (ii) all but eliminates the ability for apartments to exit rent regulation; (iii) does away with vacancy decontrol and high-income deregulation; and (iv) repealed the 20 vacancy bonus. This legislation generally limits a landlord s ability to increase rents on rent-regulated apartments and makes it more difficult to convert rent regulated apartments to market rate apartments. As a result, the value of the collateral located in New York State securing our multifamily loans or the future net operating income of such properties could potentially become impaired. 
 Uncertainties associated with increased loan originations may result in errors in judging collectability, which may lead to additional provisions for credit losses or charge-offs, which would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Increasing loan originations would likely require us to lend to borrowers with which we have limited experience. Accordingly, we would not have a significant payment history pattern with which to judge future collectability. Further, newly originated loans have not been subjected to unfavorable economic conditions. As a result, it may be difficult to predict the future performance of newly originated loans. These loans may have delinquency or charge-off levels above our recent historical experience, which could adversely affect our future performance. 
 If our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to cover actual credit losses, our earnings and capital could decrease. 
 We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers, the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans, and expectations on payments based on forecasted economic conditions. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, as well as the experience of other similarly situated institutions, and we evaluate other factors including, among other things, current economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, if delinquencies, non-accrual or non-performing loans increase, or macroeconomic conditions are worse than anticipated, our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which would require additions to our allowance. Material additions to our allowance would materially decrease our net income. 
 Effective January 1, 2021, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU ), F inancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ASU 2016-13 or CECL , which makes significant changes to the accounting for credit losses on financial instruments presented on an amortized cost basis, such as our loans held for investment, and disclosures about them. The CECL model requires an estimate of expected credit losses, measured over the contractual life of an instrument, which considers reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions in addition to information about past events and current conditions. The standard provides significant flexibility and requires a high degree of judgment with regards to pooling financial assets with similar risk characteristics and adjusting the relevant historical loss information and economic conditions in order to develop an estimate of expected lifetime losses. Providing for losses over the life of our loan portfolio is a change to the previous method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable and incurred. This change may require us to increase our allowance for credit losses in future periods, and greatly increases the types of data we need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses. It may also result in even small changes to future forecasts having a significant impact on the allowance, which could make the allowance more volatile. Any requirement to increase our allowance for credit losses on loans could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and, based on information available to them at the time of their review, may require us to increase our allowance for credit losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. An increase in our allowance for credit losses on loans or loan charge-offs as a result of these regulatory reviews may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any future credit deterioration could require us to increase our allowance for credit losses. 
 35 

The foreclosure process may adversely impact the Bank s recoveries on non-performing loans. 
 The judicial foreclosure process is protracted, especially in New Jersey, where foreclosure timelines remain among the longest in the nation, which delays our ability to resolve non-performing loans through the sale of the underlying collateral. The longer timelines have been the result of the economic crisis, additional consumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process, increased documentary requirements and judicial scrutiny, and, both voluntary and mandatory programs under which lenders may consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure. These reasons, historical issues at the largest mortgage loan servicers, and the legal and regulatory responses have impacted the foreclosure process and completion time of foreclosures for residential mortgage lenders. This may result in a material adverse effect on collateral values and our ability to minimize our losses. 
 We are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities. 
 A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and we could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to one or more of these properties. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing defaulted loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous conditions or toxic substances are found on these properties, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage, civil fines and criminal penalties regardless of when the hazardous conditions or toxic substances first affected any particular property. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses to address unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or regulations, or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws and regulations may increase our exposure to environmental liability, and heightened pressure from investors and other stakeholders may require us to incur additional expenses with respect to environmental matters. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on nonresidential real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Risks Related to Regulatory Matters 
 We are subject to extensive regulatory oversight. 
 We are subject to extensive supervision, regulation, and examination by the OCC and the FRB. As a result, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, undertake new investments and activities, and obtain financing. This regulatory structure is designed primarily for the protection of the Deposit Insurance Fund and our depositors, and not to benefit our stockholders. This regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement actions and examination policies, including policies with respect to capital levels, the timing and amount of dividend payments, the classification of assets, the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes and the timing and amounts of assessments and fees. 
 We are subject to the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties. 
 The Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution s performance under the Community Reinvestment Act or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity and restrictions on expansion. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 36 

The FRB may require us to commit capital resources to support Northfield Bank. 
 Federal law requires that a holding company act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the source of strength doctrine, the FRB may require a holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to a subsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times when the holding company may not have the resources to provide it and therefore may be required to borrow the funds or raise capital. Any borrowing or funds needed to raise capital required to make a capital injection may be difficult and expensive and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Legislative or regulatory responses to perceived financial and market problems could impair our rights against borrowers. 
 Federal, state and local laws and policies could reduce the amount distressed borrowers are otherwise contractually obligated to pay under their mortgage loans, and may limit the ability of lenders to foreclose on mortgage collateral. Restrictions on Northfield Bank s rights as creditor could result in increased credit losses on our loans and mortgage-backed securities, or increased expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor. 
 Non-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions. 
 The USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs and procedures to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, these policies and procedures may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations. 
 Monetary policies and regulations of the FRB could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 In addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the FRB. An important function of the FRB is to regulate the money supply and credit environment. Among the instruments used by the FRB to implement these objectives are open market purchases and sales of U.S. Government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in banks reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. 
 The monetary policies and regulations of the FRB have had a significant effect on the overall economy and the operating results of financial institutions in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. 
 We are required to maintain a significant percentage of our total assets in residential mortgage loans and investments secured by residential mortgage loans, which restricts our ability to diversify our loan portfolio. 
 A federal savings bank differs from a commercial bank in that it is required to maintain at least 65 of its total assets in qualified thrift investments, which generally includes loans and investments for the purchase, refinance, construction, improvement, or repair of residential real estate, as well as home equity loans, education loans and small business loans. To maintain our federal savings bank charter we have to be a qualified thrift lender or QTL in nine out of each 12 immediately preceding months. The QTL requirement limits the extent to which we can grow our commercial loan portfolio, and failing the QTL test can result in an enforcement action. However, a loan that does not exceed 2 million (including a group of loans to one borrower) that is for commercial, corporate, business, or agricultural purposes is included in our qualified thrift investments. As of December 31, 2022, we maintained 77.8 of our portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments. Because of the QTL requirement, we may be limited in our ability to change our asset mix and increase the yield on our earning assets by growing our commercial loan portfolio. 
 37 

In addition, if we continue to grow our commercial real estate loan portfolio and our residential mortgage loan portfolio decreases, it is possible that in order to maintain our QTL status, we may have to buy mortgage-backed securities or other qualifying assets at times when the terms of such investments may not be attractive. Alternatively, we may find it necessary to pursue different structures, including converting Northfield Bank s savings bank charter to a commercial bank charter. 
 We are subject to stringent capital requirements, which may adversely affect our return on equity, require us to raise additional capital, or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares. 
 The minimum capital requirements applicable to Northfield Bancorp, Inc. and Northfield Bank are: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 ; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6 ; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8 ; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4 . The final rule also established a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 , resulting in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0 , (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5 , and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5 . An institution may become subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations established a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions. 
 The application of these more stringent capital requirements, among other things, could result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with Basel III could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models, and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk-based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could result in management modifying its business strategy, and could limit our ability to make distributions, including paying dividends or buying back shares. Recent regulatory changes have made available to qualifying institutions of under 10 billion in assets an alternative community bank leverage ratio framework of 9 Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets. That framework was available for election starting in 2020, which the Northfield Bank opted into in the first quarter of 2020. However, the framework is not expected to effectively lower the amount of capital needed to comply with regulatory requirements. See Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation. 
 Risks Related to Strategic Matters 
 Implementing our growth strategies could cause us to incur significant costs and expenses, which may negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We expect to continue to grow our assets, the level of our deposits or borrowings, and the scale of our operations. Achieving our growth targets depends, in part, on our ability to attract customers that currently bank at other financial institutions in our market, thereby increasing our share of the market, implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business, identify favorable loan and investment opportunities, and acquire other banks and non-bank entities. Our ability to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to attract and retain experienced bankers, the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, competitive responses from other financial institutions in our market areas and our ability to manage our growth. Growth opportunities may not be available or we may not be able to manage our growth successfully. If we do not manage our growth effectively, our financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. 
 Acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute stockholder value. 
 We regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies. As a result, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash or equity securities may occur at any time. We seek acquisition partners that offer us either significant market presence or the potential to expand our market footprint and improve profitability through economies of scale or expanded services. 
 Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches may have an adverse effect on our financial results and may involve various other risks commonly associated with acquisitions. These include: 
 integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds; 
 converting customers to new systems; 
 combining different corporate cultures and operating systems; and 
 retaining key employees. 
 38 

Loans that were acquired as part of our acquisitions of other depository institutions were not underwritten or originated in accordance with our credit standards, including environmental matters, and we did not have long-standing relationships with many of these borrowers at the time of acquisition. The acquired loans are underwritten at the date of acquisition based on our credit standards, which can temporarily increase loans classified as special mention and substandard for a period of time until these loans are integrated and conform to our credit standards. Although we reviewed the loan portfolios of each institution acquired as part of the diligence process, and believe that we have established reasonable credit marks with regard to all loans acquired, we may incur losses in excess of the credit marks with regard to these acquired loans, and any such losses, if they occur, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 The success of an acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings. If we are unable to integrate an acquired company successfully, the anticipated benefits and cost savings may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected. A significant decline in asset valuations or cash flows may also cause us not to realize expected benefits. 
 Our inability to tailor our retail delivery model to respond to consumer preferences in banking may negatively affect earnings. 
 Our branch network continues to be a very significant source of new business generation, however, consumers continue to migrate much of their routine banking to self-service channels. In recognition of this shift in consumer patterns, we regularly review our branch network, which can result in branch consolidation accompanied by the enhancement of our capabilities to serve its customers through alternate delivery channels. The benefits of this strategy would depend on our ability to realize expected expense reductions; however, if we are not able to implement this successfully, we may experience significant customer attrition. 
 If our municipal banking deposits were lost within a short period of time, this could negatively impact our liquidity and earnings. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we held 604.7 million of municipal deposits, which represented approximately 14.6 of total deposits. These deposits may be more volatile than other deposits. If a significant amount of these deposits were withdrawn in a short period of time, it could have a negative impact on our short-term liquidity and have an adverse impact on our earnings. Further, depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on deposits or borrowings to replace such deposits. 
 Risks Related to Economic Matters 
 A decline in economic conditions could reduce demand for our products and services and/or result in increases in our level of non-performing loans, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 Unlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, our profitability depends primarily on the general economic conditions in New York, New Jersey and, to a lesser extent, eastern Pennsylvania. Local economic conditions have a significant impact on our commercial real estate, construction, and consumer loans, the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. A substantial portion of our loans are to borrowers located in or secured by collateral in the New York metropolitan area. 
 Deterioration in economic conditions, including as a result of inflation or recession, changes in interest rates, or disruptions to the global supply chain, could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations: 
 demand for our products and services may decline; 
 loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase; 
 collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, (including due to the inability to complete construction projects due to disruption in the supply chain) in turn reducing customers future borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans; 
 we may increase our allowance for credit losses; 
 the value of our securities portfolio may decline; or 
 the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us. 
 39 

Moreover, a significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by inflation, changes in interest rates, recession, acts of terrorism, an outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic events, tax reform, unemployment, an epidemic or pandemic or other factors beyond our control could further affect these local economic conditions and could further negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance. 
 Inflation can have an adverse impact on our business and on our customers. 
 Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be worth less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. Over the past year, in response to a pronounced rise in inflation, the FRB has raised certain benchmark interest rates to combat inflation. As discussed above, as inflation increases and market interest rates rise the value of our investment securities, particularly those with longer maturities, would decrease, although this effect can be less pronounced for floating rate instruments. In addition, inflation generally increases the cost of goods and services we use in our business operations, such as electricity and other utilities, which increases our non-interest expenses. Furthermore, our customers are also affected by inflation and the rising costs of goods and services used in their households and businesses, which could have a negative impact on their ability to repay their loans with us. Sustained higher interest rates by the FRB to tame persistent inflationary price pressures could also push down asset prices and weaken economic activity. A deterioration in economic conditions in the United States and our markets could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and non-performing assets, decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for our products and services, all of which, in turn, would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Risks Related to Competitive Matters 
 Strong traditional and non-traditional competition within our market areas may limit our growth and profitability. 
 We face intense competition in making loans and attracting deposits. Price competition from other financial institutions, credit unions, money market and mutual funds, insurance companies, and other non-traditional competitors such as financial technology companies, for loans and deposits sometimes results in us charging lower interest rates on our loans and paying higher interest rates on our deposits and may reduce our net interest income. Competition also makes it more difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified employees. Many of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. Our competitors also may price loan and deposit products aggressively when they enter into new lines of business or new market areas. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory, and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. If we are not able to compete effectively in our market area, our profitability may be negatively affected. The greater resources and broader offering of deposit and loan products of some of our competitors may also limit our ability to increase our interest-earning assets. 
 Risks Related to Interest Rates 
 The reversal of the historically low interest rate environment may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability. 
 The FRB decreased benchmark interest rates significantly, to near zero, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The FRB has reversed its policy of near zero interest rates given its concerns over inflation. Market interest rates have risen in response to the FRB s recent rate increases. As discussed below, the increase in market interest rates is expected to have an adverse effect on our net interest income and profitability. 
 Changes in market interest rates in an increasing rate environment could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by changes in market interest rates. Our results of operations substantially depend on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our interest-bearing liabilities generally reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets. If rates increase rapidly, we would likely have to increase the rates we pay on our deposits and borrowed funds more quickly than interest rates earned on our loans and investments, resulting in a negative effect on interest spreads and net interest income which would negatively affect our profitability. In addition, the effect of rising rates could be compounded if deposit customers move funds from transaction and savings accounts to higher rate money market or certificate of deposit accounts. Conversely, should market interest rates fall below current levels, our net interest margin could also be affected negatively if competitive pressures keep us from further reducing rates on our deposits, while the yields on our assets decrease more rapidly through loan prepayments and interest rate adjustments. 
 40 

Increases in interest rates also may decrease loan demand and/or may make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable-rate loans. Additionally, increases in interest rates may increase capitalization rates utilized in valuing income-producing properties. This can result in lower appraised values, which can limit the ability of borrowers to refinance existing debt and may result in higher charge-offs of our non-performing collateral dependent loans. 
 Our balance sheet composition is weighted towards assets with longer durations, which expose us to risks upon changes in interest rates. 
 We are subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect the average life of loans and mortgage-related securities. Decreases in interest rates often result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities as borrowers refinance their loans to reduce borrowings costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments in loans or other investments that have interest rates that are comparable to the interest rates on existing loans and securities. Increases in interest rates generally reduce prepayments. 
 Changes in interest rates also affect the value of our interest earning assets and in particular the carrying value of our securities portfolio. Generally, the value of interest-earning assets fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. To the extent interest rates increase and the value of our available-for-sale portfolio decreases, our stockholders equity will be adversely affected. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred losses of 70.2 million related to net changes in unrealized holding losses in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. 
 At December 31, 2022, our simulation model indicated that our net portfolio value (the net present value of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities) would decrease by 10.98 if there was an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in market interest rates. Although interest rate risk calculations provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net portfolio value or net interest income and likely will differ from actual results. 
 Risks Related to Operational Matters 
 Our funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits and support our future growth. 
 We must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. As a part of our liquidity management, we use a number of funding sources in addition to core deposit growth and repayments and maturities of loans and investments. These additional sources consist primarily of FHLB advances, proceeds from the sale of loans, federal funds purchased, and brokered certificates of deposit. As we continue to grow, we are likely to become more dependent on these sources. Adverse operating results or changes in industry conditions could lead to difficulty or an inability to access these additional funding sources. Our financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates. If we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In this case, our operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected. 
 Our success depends on hiring and retaining certain key personnel. 
 Our performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. We rely on key personnel to manage and operate our business, including major revenue generating functions such as loan and deposit generation. The loss of key staff may adversely affect our ability to maintain and manage these functions effectively, which could negatively affect our revenues. In addition, competition for senior executives and skilled personnel in the financial services and banking industry is intense, which means the loss of key personnel could result in increased recruiting and hiring expenses, which could cause a decrease in our net income. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. 
 41 

Risks associated with system failures, interruptions, or breaches of security could affect our earnings negatively. 
 Information technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the effect of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition, any compromise of our systems could deter customers from using our products and services. Although we rely on security systems to provide security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of security. 
 In addition, we outsource a majority of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel. 
 The occurrence of any system failures, interruption, or breach of security could damage our reputation, disrupt operations, misappropriate confidential information, damage our computer systems and result in a loss of customers and business thereby subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Cyber-attacks or other security breaches could adversely affect our operations, net income, or reputation. 
 We regularly collect, process, transmit and store significant amounts of confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others and concerning our own business, operations, plans and strategies. In some cases, this confidential or proprietary information is collected, compiled, processed, transmitted, or stored by third parties on our behalf. Our heavy reliance on information technology systems (both internal and third-party) exposes us to operational risks which include the risk of malfeasance by employees or persons outside of our organization, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, systems failures or interruptions, failures to properly implement systems upgrades, breaches of our internal control systems and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. 
 Information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial and other transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks and mobile phishing. Mobile phishing, a means for identity thieves to obtain sensitive personal information through fraudulent e-mail, text or voice mail, is an emerging threat targeting the customers of financial entities. A failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our third-party service providers, as a result of cyber-attacks or information security breaches or due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions could adversely affect our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and/or cause losses. 
 If this confidential or proprietary information were to be mishandled, misused, or lost, we could be exposed to significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, civil litigation, and financial loss. 
 Although we employ a variety of physical, procedural, and technological safeguards to protect this confidential and proprietary information from mishandling, misuse, or loss, these safeguards do not provide absolute assurance that mishandling, misuse, or loss of the information will not occur, and that if mishandling, misuse, or loss of information does occur, those events will be promptly detected and addressed. Similarly, when confidential or proprietary information is collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored by third parties on our behalf, our policies and procedures require that the third party agree to maintain the confidentiality of the information, establish and maintain policies and procedures designed to preserve the confidentiality of the information, and permit us to confirm the third party s compliance with the terms of the agreement. As information security risks and cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.

Because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, we face significant operational risks, including fraud and other financial crimes. 
 We operate in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a high number of transactions over short periods of time. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. Our loans to businesses and individuals and our deposit relationships and related transactions are subject to exposure to the risk of loss due to fraud and other financial crimes. In addition, employee errors and employee and customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. In the event of a breakdown in the internal control system, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action, and suffer damage to our reputation. 
 If our enterprise risk management framework is not effective at mitigating risk and loss to us, we could suffer unexpected losses and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
 Our enterprise risk management framework seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and return, which is critical to optimizing stockholder value. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit, liquidity, operational, regulatory compliance and reputational. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
 Risks Related to Environmental Matters 
 Societal responses to climate change could adversely affect our business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on our customers. 
 Concerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and could continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses also may change their behaviors as a result of these concerns. We and our customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. We and our customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions, operating process changes and other issues. The impact on our customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities. Among the impacts to us could be a drop in demand for our products and services, particularly in certain sectors. In addition, we could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans. Our efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions, including by increasing our business with climate-friendly companies, may not be effective in protecting us from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior. 
 Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by natural disasters, health epidemics, and other catastrophic events. 
 We could be adversely affected if key personnel or a significant number of employees were to become unavailable due to a pandemic, natural disaster, war, act of terrorism, accident, or other reason. Any of these events could result in the temporary reduction of operations, employees, and customers, which could limit our ability to provide services. Additionally, many of our borrowers may suffer property damage, experience interruption of their businesses or lose their jobs after such events. Those borrowers might not be able to repay their loans, and the collateral for such loans may decline significantly in value. 
 43 

Other Risks Related to Our Business 
 Changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our accounting policies are essential to understanding our financial results and condition. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Some of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If such estimates or assumptions underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses. 
 From time to time, the FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be hard to predict and could materially affect how we report our results of operations and financial condition. We could also be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements in material amounts. 
 We hold certain intangible assets that could be classified as impaired in the future. If these assets are considered to be either partially or fully impaired in the future, our earnings and the book values of these assets would decrease. 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 41.0 million in goodwill which we are required to test on a periodic basis. The impairment testing process considers a variety of factors, including the current market price of our common shares, the estimated net present value of our assets and liabilities and information concerning the terminal valuation of similarly situated insured depository institutions. It is possible that future impairment testing could result in a partial or full impairment of the value of our goodwill. If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and the book value of goodwill will be reduced by the amount of the impairment. 
 Changes in the valuation of our securities portfolio could reduce net income and lower our capital levels. 
 Our securities portfolio may be affected by fluctuations in market value, potentially reducing accumulated other comprehensive income and/or earnings. Fluctuations in market value may be caused by changes in market interest rates, lower market prices for securities and limited investor demand. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis, with more frequent evaluation for selected issues. In analyzing a debt issuer s financial condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, industry analysts reports and, to a lesser extent given the relatively insignificant levels of depreciation in our debt portfolio, spread differentials between the effective rates on instruments in the portfolio compared to risk-free rates. In analyzing an equity issuer s financial condition, management considers industry analysts reports, financial performance, and projected target prices of investment analysts within a one-year time period. If this evaluation shows impairment to the actual or projected cash flows associated with one or more securities, a potential loss to earnings may occur. Changes in interest rates also can have an adverse effect on our financial condition, as our available-for-sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value, and therefore are impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. We increase or decrease our stockholders equity by the amount of change in the estimated fair value of the available-for-sale securities, net of taxes. The declines in market value could result in other-than-temporary impairments of these assets, which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred losses of 70.2 million related to net changes in unrealized holding losses in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. 
 Federal banking regulations restrict insured depository institutions and their affiliated companies from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of certain securities, investing in funds with collateral comprised of less than 100 of loans that are not registered with the SEC and from engaging in hedging activities that do not hedge a specific identified risk. We continue to analyze the impact of this regulation on our investment portfolio, and whether any changes are required to our investment strategies that could negatively affect our earnings. 
 44 

We may be adversely affected by recent changes in tax laws. 
 Changes in federal tax laws may have an adverse effect on the market for, and the valuation of, residential properties, and on the demand for such loans in the future and could make it harder for borrowers to make their loan payments. In addition, these changes also have a disproportionate effect on taxpayers in states with high residential home prices and high state and local taxes, like New Jersey and New York. If home ownership becomes less attractive, demand for mortgage loans could decrease. The value of the properties securing loans in our loan portfolio may be adversely impacted as a result of the changing economics of home ownership, which could require an increase in our provision for credit losses, which would reduce our profitability and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Additionally, legislation in New Jersey imposes a temporary surtax on corporations earning New Jersey allocated income in excess of 1 million of 2.5 for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019, and of 1.5 for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021. On September 29, 2020, the state extended the 2.5 surtax through December 31, 2023, retroactively to tax years beginning January 1, 2020. The legislation also requires combined filing for certain members of an affiliated group for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2019. The new legislation may cause us to lose the benefit of certain of our tax management strategies and may cause our total tax expense to increase. 
 Various factors may make takeover attempts more difficult to achieve. 
 Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, federal regulations, Delaware law, shares of restricted stock and stock options that we have granted or may grant to employees and directors, stock ownership by our management and directors and employment agreements that we have entered into with our executive officers, and various other factors may make it more difficult for companies or persons to acquire control of Northfield Bancorp, Inc. without the consent of our Board of Directors, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
 We will be required to transition from the use of the LIBOR interest rate index in the future. 
 We have certain loans and investment securities indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR ). The LIBOR index will be discontinued for U.S. Dollar settings effective June 30, 2023. The language in our LIBOR-based contracts and financial instruments has developed over time and may have various events that trigger when a successor rate to the designated rate would be selected. If a trigger is satisfied, contracts and financial instruments may give the calculation agent discretion over the substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates to be selected. The implementation of a substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our borrowers may result in our incurring expenses in effecting the transition, may result in reduced loan balances if borrowers do not accept the substitute index or indices, and may result in disputes or litigation with customers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute index or indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, since alternative rates are calculated differently, the transition may change our market risk profile, requiring changes to risk and pricing models. 
 Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic 
 The economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak could continue to affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Global health concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have continued to affect the macroeconomic environment, both nationally and in the Company s existing geographic footprint. 
 Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of current economic circumstances, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including when the coronavirus can be fully controlled and abated, the advent of new variants and any measures to combat the pandemic by governmental authorities. The COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local and national economic consequences, could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of Northfield Bancorp, Inc. and the Notes thereto included elsewhere in this report (collectively, the Financial Statements ). 
 Overview 
 Net income was 61.1 million, or 1.32 per diluted common share, and 70.7 million, or 1.45 per diluted common share, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Significant variances from the prior year are as follows: a 2.7 million increase in net interest income, a 10.7 million increase in the provision for credit losses on loans, a 6.5 million decrease in non-interest income, a 2.2 million decrease in non-interest expense, and a 2.7 million decrease in income tax expense. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 included 925,000, after tax 0.02 per share) of income generated from the accelerated accretion of fees related to the forgiveness of PPP loans and 326,000, after tax 0.01 per share) in gains on loans sold. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 included 4.0 million, after tax 0.08 per share) of income generated from the accelerated accretion of fees related to the forgiveness of PPP loans, 1.4 million, after tax 0.03 per share) of accretable income related to the payoffs of PCD loans, 1.0 million, after tax 0.02 per share) in gains on loans sold, and 677,000 0.01 per share) of tax-exempt income from bank-owned life insurance proceeds in excess of the cash surrender value of the policies. 
 Assets increased by 170.8 million, or 3.1 , to 5.60 billion at December 31, 2022, from 5.43 billion at December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of increases in total loans of 437.1 million, or 11.5 , other assets of 17.2 million, or 46.3 , and FHLBNY stock of 8.0 million, or 36.0 . Partially offsetting these increases were decreases in available-for sale debt securities of 256.1 million, or 21.2 , and cash and cash equivalents of 45.3 million, or 49.7 . 
 Liabilities increased 209.2 million, or 4.5 , to 4.90 billion at December 31, 2022, from 4.69 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in FHLB advances and other borrowings of 187.1 million, the issuance of subordinated debt, net of issuance costs, of 60.9 million, an increase in advance payments by borrowers for taxes and insurance of 1.1 million and an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of 4.2 million. The increases were partially offset by decreases in deposits of 19.1 million and securities sold under agreements to repurchase of 25.0 million. 
 Stockholders equity decreased by 38.5 million to 701.4 million at December 31, 2022, from 739.9 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease was attributable to a 50.4 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with a decline in the estimated fair value of our debt securities available-for-sale portfolio, due to the higher interest rate environment, 24.1 million in dividend payments, and 30.8 million in stock repurchases, partially offset by net income of 61.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and a 5.7 million increase in equity award activity.

Critical Accounting Policies 
 Critical accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties, and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition and results of operation depend, and which involve the most complex subjective decisions or assessments, are the following: 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans. Effective January 1, 2021, the Company adopted new accounting guidance, which requires entities to estimate and recognize an allowance for lifetime expected credit losses for loans and other financial assets measured at amortized cost. Previously, an allowance for loan losses was recognized based on probable and reasonably estimable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. See Note 1 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company's accounting policies and methodologies for establishing the allowance for credit losses. We identified our policy on the allowance for credit losses on loans to be a critical accounting policy because management makes subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. 
 The allowance for credit losses on loans is a critical accounting estimate for the following reasons: 
 
 Changes in the provision for credit losses can materially affect our financial results; 
 Estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses require us to utilize a reasonable and supportable forecast period based upon forward-looking economic scenarios in order to estimate probability of default and loss given default rates which our CECL methodology encompasses; 
 The allowance for credit losses on loans is influenced by factors outside of our control such as industry and business trends, as well as economic conditions such as trends in housing prices, interest rates, gross domestic product, inflation, and unemployment; and 
 Judgment is required to determine whether the models used to generate the allowance for credit losses on loans produce an estimate that is sufficient to encompass the current view of lifetime expected credit losses. 
 The allowance for credit losses on loans has been determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We are responsible for the timely and periodic determination of the amount of the allowance required. We believe that our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover identifiable losses, as well as estimated losses inherent in our portfolio for which certain losses are probable but not specifically identifiable. 
 Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on loans. This quarterly process is performed by the accounting department, in conjunction with the credit administration department, and approved by the Allowance Committee. The Chief Financial Officer performs a final review of the calculation. All supporting documentation with regard to the evaluation process is maintained by the accounting department. Each quarter a summary of the allowance for credit losses is presented by the Chief Financial Officer to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 Under the CECL methodology, the allowance for credit losses on loans has two components. (1) a collective reserve component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share common risk characteristics and (2) an individual reserve component for loans that do not share risk characteristics, consisting of collateral-dependent and TDR loans. 
 Allowance for Collectively Evaluated Loans Held-for-Investment 
 
 The Company estimates the collective reserve using a risk rating migration model which calculates an expected life of loan loss percentage for each loan by generating probability of default and loss given default metrics. These metrics are multiplied by the exposure at default, taking into consideration prepayments, to calculate the quantitative component of the collective reserve. The metrics are based on the migration of loans from performing to loss by credit risk rating or delinquency categories using historical life-of-loan analysis periods for each loan portfolio pool, and the severity of loss, based on the aggregate net lifetime losses incurred using the Company's own historical loss experience and comparable peer data loss history. The model's expected losses based on loss history are adjusted for qualitative adjustments. Among other things, these adjustments include and account for differences in: (i) changes in lending policies and procedures; (ii) changes in local, regional, national, and international economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of our portfolio, including the condition of various market segments; (iii) changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; (iv) changes in the quality of our loan review system; (v) the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations; and (vi) the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in our existing portfolio. 
 
 52 

The Company utilizes a two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period after which estimated losses revert to historical loss experience immediately for the remaining life of the loan. In establishing its estimate of expected credit losses, the Company utilizes five externally-sourced forward-looking economic scenarios developed by Moody's Analytics Moody's ). 
 
 Management utilizes five different Moody's scenarios so as to incorporate uncertainties related to the economic environment. These scenarios, which range from more benign to more severe economic outlooks, include a most likely outcome (the Baseline scenario) and four less likely scenarios referred to as the Upside and Downside scenarios. Each scenario is assigned a weighting with a majority of the weighting placed on the Baseline scenario and lower weights placed on both the Upside and Downside scenarios. The weighting assigned by management is based on the economic outlook and available information at the reporting date. The model projects economic variables under each scenario based on detailed statistical analyses. The Company has identified and selected key variables that most closely correlated to its historical credit performance, which include: gross domestic product, unemployment, and three collateral indices: the Commercial Property Price Index, the Commercial Property Price Apartment Index and the Case-Shiller Home Price Index. 
 
 Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a number of inputs, most notably the macroeconomic forecast assumptions as well as the reasonable and supportable forecasting periods that are incorporated in our estimate of credit losses on loans. Therefore, as the macroeconomic environment and related forecasts change or decisions are made to shorten or lengthen the forecasting period, the allowance for credit losses may change materially. The following sensitivity analyses do not represent management s expectations of the deterioration of our portfolios or the economic environment, but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses to changes in key inputs. 
 
 The following table details the five Moody's scenarios utilized in determining the allowance for credit losses on loans at December 31, 2022, and weightings of each scenario: 
 Model Scenario Moody's Scenario Description Weight S0 Upside - 4th Percentile 4 S1 Upside - 10th Percentile 10 S3 Downside - 90th Percentile 10 S4 Downside - 96th Percentile 4 Baseline Baseline Scenario 72 
 
 If we placed 100 weighting on the baseline scenario, the quantitative allowance for credit losses would have been approximately 1.5 million lower. Conversely, if we removed the upside scenarios and reallocated the weights from S0 to S4 and S1 to S3, the allowance for credit losses would increase approximately 3.6 million. These forecasts revert to our long-term historical average loss rate after a 24 month forecasting period. 
 
 Because management's estimates of the allowance for credit losses on loans involve a high degree of judgement, the subjectivity of the assumptions used and the potential for changes in the forecasted economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the allowance recorded, there is uncertainty inherent in such estimates. Changes in these estimates could significantly impact the allowance for credit losses on loans. 
 53 

Allowance for Individually Evaluated Loans 
 The Company measures specific reserves for individual loans that do not share common risk characteristics with other loans, consisting of all TDRs and non-accrual loans with an outstanding balance of 500,000 or greater. Loans individually evaluated for impairment are assessed to determine that the loan s carrying value is not in excess of the estimated fair value of the collateral less cost to sell, if the loan is collateral-dependent, or the present value of the expected future cash flows, if the loan is not collateral-dependent. Management performs an evaluation of each impaired loan and generally obtains updated appraisals as part of the evaluation. In addition, management adjusts estimated fair values down to appropriately consider recent market conditions, our willingness to accept a lower sales price to effect a quick sale, and costs to dispose of any supporting collateral. Determining the estimated fair value of underlying collateral (and related costs to sell) can be difficult in illiquid real estate markets and is subject to significant assumptions and estimates. Management employs an independent third-party management firm that specializes in appraisal preparation and review to ascertain the reasonableness of updated appraisals. Projecting the expected cash flows under troubled debt restructurings which are not collateral-dependent is inherently subjective and requires, among other things, an evaluation of the borrower s current and projected financial condition. Actual results may be significantly different than our projections and our established allowance for credit losses on these loans, which could have a material effect on our financial results. Individually impaired loans that have no impairment losses are not considered for collective allowances described earlier. 
 We have a concentration of loans secured by real property located in New York City, New Jersey, and, to a lesser extent, eastern Pennsylvania. As a substantial amount of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate, appraisals of the underlying value of property securing loans are critical in determining the amount of the allowance required for specific loans. Assumptions for appraisal valuations are instrumental in determining the value of properties. Overly optimistic assumptions or negative changes to assumptions could significantly impact the valuation of a property securing a loan and the related allowance determined. The assumptions supporting such appraisals are reviewed by management and an independent third-party appraiser to determine that the resulting values reasonably reflect amounts realizable on the collateral. Based on the composition of our loan portfolio, we believe the primary risks are increases in interest rates, a decline in the economy generally, or a decline in real estate market values in New York, New Jersey, or eastern Pennsylvania. Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect our loan portfolio resulting in delinquencies, increased loan losses, and increased loan loss provisions. 
 Although we believe we have established and maintained the allowance for credit losses at adequate levels, changes may be necessary if future economic or other conditions differ substantially from our estimation of the current operating environment. Although management uses the information available, the level of the allowance for credit losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short-term change. In addition, the OCC, as an integral part of their examination process, will review our allowance for credit losses on loans and may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. 
 We also maintain an allowance for estimated losses on off-balance sheet credit risks related to loan commitments and standby letters of credit. The reserve for off-balance sheet exposures is determined using the CECL reserve factor in the related funded loan segment, adjusted for an average historical funding rate. The allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and the corresponding provision is included in other non-interest expense. 
 Deferred Income Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established. We consider the determination of this valuation allowance to be a critical accounting policy because of the need to exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets, including projections of future taxable income. These judgments and estimates are reviewed quarterly as regulatory and business factors change. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets may be required if the amounts of taxes recoverable through loss carry backs decline, or if we project lower levels of future taxable income. Such a valuation allowance would be established and any subsequent changes to such allowance would require an adjustment to income tax expense that could adversely affect our operating results.

Accounting Standards Issued but Not Yet Effective 
 ASU No. 2022-02 . In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures . The amendments in this ASU were issued to (1) eliminate accounting guidance for TDRs by creditors, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty; (2) require disclosures of current period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases. For entities that have adopted the amendments in ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, this update will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 ASU No. 2020-04. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform ("ASC 848"): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting , which provides temporary optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contract modifications and hedging relationships, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. It is intended to help stakeholders during the global market-wide reference rate transition period. The guidance is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. However, in December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, deferring the sunset date to December 31, 2024. The Company has evaluated the regulatory requirements to cease the use of LIBOR and has put in place systems and capabilities for this purpose. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 and 2021 
 Total assets increased 170.8 million, or 3.1 , to 5.60 billion at December 31, 2022, from 5.43 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases in total loans of 437.1 million, or 11.5 , other assets of 17.2 million, or 46.3 , and FHLBNY stock of 8.0 million, or 36.0 , partially offset by decreases in available-for sale debt securities of 256.1 million, or 21.2 , and cash and cash equivalents of 45.3 million, or 49.7 . 
 Cash and cash equivalents decreased by 45.3 million, or 49.7 , to 45.8 million at December 31, 2022, from 91.1 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease was due to a decrease in deposits, combined with an increase in net loans held-for-investment, offset by an increase in FHLB advances and proceeds from the issuance of subordinated debentures. Balances fluctuate based on the timing of receipt of security and loan repayments and the redeployment of cash into higher-yielding assets such as loans and securities, or the funding of deposit outflows or borrowing maturities. 
 The Company s available-for-sale debt securities portfolio decreased by 256.1 million, or 21.2 , to 952.2 million at December 31, 2022, from 1.21 billion at December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily attributable to paydowns, maturities, calls, and sales, as well as a 70.2 million increase in net unrealized losses due to an increase in market interest rates. At December 31, 2022, 697.3 million of the portfolio consisted of residential mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae. In addition, the Company held 182.7 million in corporate bonds, all of which were considered investment grade at December 31, 2022, 72.1 million in U.S. Government agency securities, and 21,000 in municipal bonds. 
 Equity securities increased by 5.1 million to 10.4 million at December 31, 2022, from 5.3 million at December 31, 2021, due to an increase in the market value of our investment in a Small Business Administration Loan Fund. This investment is utilized by the Bank as part of its Community Reinvestment Act program. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our non-owner occupied commercial real estate concentration (as defined by regulatory guidance) to total risk-based capital was approximately 455.8 . Management believes that the Bank has implemented appropriate risk management practices including risk assessments, board-approved underwriting policies and related procedures, which include monitoring Bank portfolio performance, performing market analysis (economic and real estate), and stressing the Bank s commercial real estate portfolio under severe, adverse economic conditions. Although management believes the Bank has implemented appropriate policies and procedures to manage its commercial real estate concentration risk, the Bank s regulators could require it to implement additional policies and procedures or could require it to maintain higher levels of regulatory capital, which might adversely affect its loan originations, ability to pay dividends, and profitability. 
 
 Loans held-for-investment, net, increased by 437.1 million to 4.24 billion at December 31, 2022, from 3.81 billion at December 31, 2021. The overall increase was due to strong loan originations. Multifamily loans increased 306.5 million, or 12.2 , to 2.82 billion at December 31, 2022 from 2.52 billion at December 31, 2021, commercial real estate loans increased 90.7 million, or 11.2 , to 899.2 million at December 31, 2022 from 808.6 million at December 31, 2021, home equity loans increased 42.6 million, or 38.7 , to 152.6 million at December 31, 2022 from 110.0 million at December 31, 2021, and commercial and industrial loans (excluding PPP loans) increased 49.1 million, or 48.8 , to 149.6 million at December 31, 2022 from 100.5 million at December 31, 2021. The increases were partially offset by decreases in one-to-four family residential loans of 9.7 million, or 5.3 , to 173.9 million at December 31, 2022 from 183.7 million at December 31, 2021, construction and land loans of 2.6 million, or 9.3 , to 24.9 million at December 31, 2022 from 27.5 million at December 31, 2021, and PPP loans of 35.4 million, or 87.3 , to 5.1 million at December 31, 2022 from 40.5 million at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, the Company had eight PPP loans outstanding totaling 5.1 million compared to 377 loans outstanding totaling 40.5 million at December 31, 2021. 
 The Company participated in the PPP, established as part of the CARES Act, and administered by the SBA. The PPP provided 100 federally guaranteed loans for small businesses to cover payroll, utilities, rent and interest. These small business loans may be forgiven if borrowers maintained their payrolls and satisfied certain other conditions for a period of time during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company began accepting and funding loans under this program in April 2020 and the program has been largely completed with substantially all of the borrowers receiving forgiveness payments. The Company originated 2,343 PPP loans totaling approximately 232.2 million and through December 31, 2022, 2,322 borrowers have received forgiveness payments totaling approximately 225.4 million.

 The geographic locations of the properties collateralizing the loans purchased in the table above are as follows: 76.1 in New York and 23.9 in New Jersey. 
 PCD loans totaled 11.5 million at December 31, 2022, and 15.8 million at December 31, 2021. Upon adoption of the CECL accounting standard on January 1, 2021, the allowance for credit losses related to PCD loans was recorded through a gross-up that increased the amortized cost-basis of PCD loans by 6.8 million with a corresponding increase to the allowance for credit losses. The decrease in the PCD loan balance at December 31, 2022 was due to PCD loans being paid off during the period. The majority of the remaining PCD loan balance consists of loans acquired as part of a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-assisted transaction. The Company accreted interest income attributable to PCD loans of 1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. PCD loans had an allowance for credit losses of approximately 3.9 million and 4.7 million, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 
 Bank-owned life insurance increased 3.4 million, or 2.1 , to 167.9 million at December 31, 2022, as compared to 164.5 million at December 31, 2021. The increase resulted from income earned on bank-owned life insurance for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Other assets increased 17.2 million, or 46.3 , to 54.4 million at December 31, 2022, from 37.2 million at December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in deferred tax assets primarily due to an increase in unrealized losses on the securities available-for-sale portfolio as well as an increase in interest rate swap assets. 
 FHLBNY stock increased by 8.0 million, or 36.0 , to 30.4 million at December 31, 2022, from 22.3 million at December 31, 2021. The increase in FHLBNY stock directly correlates with higher short-term borrowing balances at December 31, 2022, as compared to December 31, 2021. 
 Total liabilities increased 209.2 million, or 4.5 , to 4.90 billion at December 31, 2022, from 4.69 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in FHLB advances and other borrowings of 187.1 million, the issuance of subordinated debt, net of issuance costs, of 60.9 million, an increase in advance payments by borrowers for taxes and insurance of 1.1 million and an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of 4.2 million. The increases were partially offset by decreases in deposits of 19.1 million and securities sold under agreements to repurchase of 25.0 million. 
 57 

Deposits decreased 19.1 million, or 0.46 , to 4.15 billion at December 31, 2022, as compared to 4.17 billion at December 31, 2021. The decrease was attributable to decreases of 25.8 million in transaction accounts, 249.6 million in savings accounts, and 101.4 million in money market accounts, partially offset by an increase of 357.7 million in certificates of deposit, primarily brokered deposits. The decrease in deposits was the result of competitive pricing pressures as market rates continue to increase. 
 Borrowed funds increased to 644.9 million at December 31, 2022, from 421.8 million at December 31, 2021. The increase in borrowings was due to an increase in FHLB and other borrowings of 187.1 million and the issuance of 62.0 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed to floating subordinated notes (the Notes ). The Notes are non-callable for five years, have a stated maturity of June 30, 2032, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.00 until June 30, 2027. From July 2027 to the maturity date or early redemption date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to a level equal to the then current three-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 200 basis points. Debt issuance costs totaled 1.1 million. Partially offsetting the increases was a decrease in securities sold under agreements to repurchase of 25.0 million. Management utilizes borrowings to mitigate interest rate risk, for short-term liquidity, and to a lesser extent from time to time, as part of leverage strategies. 
 Total stockholders equity decreased by 38.5 million to 701.4 million at December 31, 2022, from 739.9 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease was attributable to a 50.4 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with a decline in the estimated fair value of our debt securities available-for-sale portfolio, 24.1 million in dividend payments, and 30.8 million in stock repurchases, partially offset by net income of 61.1 million for year ended December 31, 2022, and a 5.7 million increase in equity award activity. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased approximately 2.1 million of its common stock outstanding at an average price of 14.72 for a total of 30.8 million pursuant to approved stock repurchase plans. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 22.4 million in remaining capacity under its current stock repurchase program. 
 Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 
 Net Income. Net income was 61.1 million and 70.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Significant variances from the prior year are as follows: a 2.7 million increase in net interest income, a 10.7 million increase in the provision for credit losses on loans, a 6.5 million decrease in non-interest income, and a 2.2 million decrease in non-interest expense. 
 Interest Income. Interest income increased 7.4 million, or 4.3 , to 179.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from 172.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets of 155.3 million, or 3.0 and a four basis point increase in the yields earned on interest-earning assets to 3.37 for the year ended December 31, 2022, from 3.33 for the comparative prior year due to a rise in interest rates. The increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets was due primarily to increases in the average balance of loans outstanding of 214.9 million and the average balance of other securities of 133.9 million, partially offset by decreases in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities of 111.6 million, the average balance of FHLBNY stock of 2.9 million, and the average balance of interest-earning deposits in financial institutions of 79.1 million. The Company accreted interest income related to PCD loans of 1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The higher accretable PCD interest income in the prior year was primarily related to payoffs of PCD loans. Fees recognized from PPP loans totaled 1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Loan prepayment income included in interest income was 4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 4.7 million, or 28.4 , to 21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was due to an increase in interest expense on deposits of 4.1 million, or 65.8 , and an increase in interest expense on borrowings of 651,000, or 6.2 . The increase in interest expense on deposits was attributable to an 11 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits to 0.30 for the year ended December 31, 2022, and a 106.6 million, or 3.2 increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposit accounts. The increase in interest expense on borrowings was attributable to a 40 basis point increase in the average cost of borrowings, partially offset by a 54.4 million, or 10.9 , decrease in average borrowings outstanding. 
 58 

Net Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased 2.7 million, or 1.7 , to 158.3 million, from 155.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to a 155.3 million, or 3.0 , increase in average interest-earning assets partially offset by a four basis point decrease in net interest margin to 2.97 from 3.01 . The decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increasing faster than the repricing of interest-earning assets. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 11 basis points to 0.55 for the year ended December 31, 2022, from 0.44 for the year ended December 31, 2021, driven by both higher cost of deposits and borrowed funds, reflective of the rising rate environment. The increase in the cost of borrowings was also due in part to the issuance of 60.9 million of subordinated notes (net of issuance costs) in June 2022. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was partially offset by an increase in yields on interest-earning assets, which increased four basis points to 3.37 for the year ended December 31, 2022, from 3.33 for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Provision for Credit Losses. The provision for credit losses on loans increased by 10.7 million to a provision of 4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a benefit of 6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The prior year benefit for credit losses was primarily due to the improvement in the economic forecast as a result of the post-pandemic recovery and an improvement in asset quality. The current year provision for credit losses was primarily due to loan growth and a declining macroeconomic forecast, partially offset by an improvement in asset quality and lower net charge-offs. At December 31, 2022, management qualitatively adjusted the economic forecast to account for uncertainty inherent in the third-party economic forecast scenarios utilized. Net charge-offs were 838,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to net charge-offs of 2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Partially offsetting the increase in the provision for credit losses on loans was a decrease in the provision for unfunded commitments of 1.4 million attributable to a decrease in the pipeline of loans approved and awaiting closing, which is a component of other non-interest expense. 
 Non-interest Income. Non-interest income decreased 6.5 million, or 44.8 , to 8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from 14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to a decrease of 3.9 million in gains on trading securities, net, a 948,000 decrease in gains on sales of loans, a 689,000 decrease in income on bank-owned life insurance attributable to fewer policies in 2022, and a 1.2 million decrease in net realized gains on available-for-sale debt securities. For the year ended December 31, 2022, losses on trading securities were 2.2 million, as compared to gains of 1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The trading portfolio is utilized to fund the Company s deferred compensation obligation to certain employees and directors of the Company's deferred compensation plan (the Plan ). The participants of this Plan, at their election, defer a portion of their compensation. Gains and losses on trading securities have no effect on net income since participants benefit from, and bear the full risk of, changes in the trading securities market values. Therefore, the Company records an equal and offsetting amount in compensation expense, reflecting the change in the Company s obligations under the Plan. The decrease in gains on sales of loans was due to a 1.4 million gain realized on the sale of approximately 126.3 million of multifamily loans in the second quarter of 2021, as compared to a 453,000 gain realized on the sale of five SBA loans totaling approximately 5.8 million in 2022. Partially offsetting the decreases was an increase of 311,000 in fees and service charges for customer services. 
 Non-interest Expense . Non-interest expense decreased 2.2 million, or 2.8 , to 76.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 79.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a 1.7 million decrease in employee compensation and benefits, a 1.4 million decrease in credit loss expense for off-balance sheet credit exposures, and a 715,000 decrease in occupancy expense. The decrease in employee compensation and benefits was due to a 3.9 million decrease in the mark to market of the Company's deferred compensation plan expense, which as discussed above has no effect on net income, as well as a decrease in medical benefit costs, partially offset by an increase in salary expense related to annual merit increases, and an increase in equity award expense related to new awards issued in the first quarter of 2022. The decrease in credit loss expense for off-balance sheet credit exposures was due to a benefit of 1.1 million recorded in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a provision of 307,000 for the prior year, attributed to a decrease in the pipeline of loans approved and awaiting closing. The decrease in occupancy expense was primarily related to lower property maintenance costs and depreciation expense. Partially offsetting the decreases were increases in data processing costs of 631,000, attributable to increased customer accounts and a higher number of transactions, professional fees of 250,000, related to higher recruitment, consulting and outsourcing fees, and other expense of 871,000, primarily related to higher charitable contributions and other operating expenses.

Income Tax Expense. The Company recorded income tax expense of 23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 26.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, with the decrease due to lower taxable income. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 28.0 , compared to 27.3 for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 
 Net Income. Net income was 70.7 million and 37.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Significant variances from the prior year are as follows: a 25.8 million increase in net interest income, an 18.9 million decrease in the provision for credit losses on loans, a 3.0 million increase in non-interest income, and a 646,000 increase in non-interest expense. 
 Interest Income. Interest income increased 4.2 million, or 2.5 , to 172.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from 168.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, due to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets of 211.3 million, or 4.3 , largely attributable to assets acquired in the Victory acquisition on July 1, 2020. The increase was due primarily to increases in the average balance of loans outstanding of 239.5 million and the average balance of other securities of 19.7 million, partially offset by decreases in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities of 39.8 million, the average balance of FHLBNY stock of 4.6 million, and the average balance of interest-earning deposits in financial institutions of 3.5 million. Partially offsetting the increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets was a five basis point decrease in the yields earned on interest-earning assets to 3.33 for the year ended December 31, 2021, from 3.38 for the comparative prior year. The decrease in earning asset yields was due to decreases in market interest rates coupled with PPP loan originations, which have lower yields than other loans. The Company accreted interest income related to its PCD/PCI loans of 3.7 million and 2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in accretable interest income was primarily related to payoffs of PCD loans in the first quarter of 2021. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021, included loan prepayment income of 5.1 million as compared to 2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Also contributing to the increase in net interest income was the recognition of fees related to PPP loans paid-off. Fees recognized from PPP loans totaled 5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased 21.7 million, or 56.6 , to 16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 38.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was due to a decrease in interest expense on deposits of 19.0 million, or 75.4 , as well as a decrease in interest expense on borrowings of 2.7 million, or 20.3 . The decrease in interest expense on deposits was attributable to a 58 basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing deposits to 0.19 for the year ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by a 49.9 million, or 1.5 increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposit accounts. The decrease in the cost of interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to the lower interest rate environment and a change in the composition of the deposit portfolio as the average balance of transaction accounts increased and the average balance of certificates of deposit decreased. The decrease in interest expense on borrowings was primarily attributable to a 143.8 million, or 22.3 , decrease in average borrowings outstanding, which was partially offset by a five basis point increase in the average cost of borrowings. 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021, increased 25.8 million, or 19.9 , to 155.6 million, from 129.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a 211.3 million, or 4.3 , increase in average interest-earning assets as well as a 40 basis point increase in net interest margin to 3.01 from 2.61 . The increase in net interest margin was primarily due to the decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities outpacing the decrease in yields on interest-earning assets. Yields on interest-earning assets decreased five basis points to 3.33 for the year ended December 31, 2021, from 3.38 for the comparative prior year. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased by 54 basis points to 0.44 for the year ended December 31, 2021, from 0.98 for the year ended December 31, 2020, driven by a lower cost of deposits. 
 Provision for Credit Losses. The provision for credit losses on loans decreased by 18.9 million to a benefit of 6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a provision of 12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in the provision for credit losses was primarily the result of improvements in the economic forecast and asset quality. The improvement in asset quality was primarily attributable to an improvement in risk ratings as loans previously modified for COVID-19 relief returned to consistent payment status. The higher provision for loan losses in 2020 was primarily due to increases in qualitative adjustments used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses related to unemployment, loan risk rating changes and increased risks related to loans on forbearance, resulting from economic uncertainty attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic under the incurred loss methodology. Net charge-offs were 2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily related to PCD loans, as compared to net charge-offs of 3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

On January 1, 2021, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments- Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. CECL requires the measurement of all expected credit losses over the life of financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. In connection with the adoption of CECL, the Company recognized a cumulative effect adjustment that reduced stockholders equity by 3.1 million, net of tax. At adoption, the Company increased its allowance for credit losses by 11.1 million, comprised of 10.4 million and 737,000, respectively, for loans and unfunded commitments, including 6.8 million related to PCD loans. For PCD loans, the allowance for credit losses recorded is recognized through a gross-up that increases the amortized cost basis of loans with a corresponding increase to the allowance for credit losses, and therefore results in no impact to shareholders' equity. 
 Non-interest Income. Non-interest income increased 3.0 million to 14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from 11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, due primarily to: an increase of 1.4 million in fees and service charges for customer services, as the prior year reflected fees waived and fewer transactions related to lower consumer spending in the early part of the pandemic; an increase of 1.2 million in gains on sales of available-for-sale debt securities, net; a 736,000 increase in gains on sales of loans; and a 329,000 increase in income on bank-owned life insurance income related to an increase in benefit claims. The increase in gains on sales of loans resulted from the sales of approximately 126.3 million of multifamily loans for gains of 1.4 million in the second quarter of 2021, compared to sales of 47.5 million of multifamily loans for gains of 665,000 in the second quarter of 2020. The Company periodically considers the sale of loans to manage its overall risk profile, including consideration of interest rate risk, concentration risk and capital deployment opportunities. Partially offsetting the increases was a 781,000 decrease in other income primarily due to a decrease in fees on loan swap transactions for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, due to a lower volume of such transactions in 2021. 
 Non-interest Expense . Non-interest expense increased 646,000, or 0.8 , to 79.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 78.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by 2.2 million, primarily due to increases in salary and medical benefit expenses associated with the addition of former Victory employees, combined with annual merit increases and an increase in the employee stock option plan expense, partially offset by a decrease in change-in-control and severance compensation paid to former Victory employees in the prior year. FDIC insurance premiums increased by 480,000 due to an increase in the insurance assessment rate and the receipt of a small bank assessment credit in the prior year that was not available in 2021. Other expense increased by 518,000, primarily due to an increase in the reserve for unfunded commitments as well as an increase in other operating expenses. Partially offsetting the increases was a 1.2 million decrease in occupancy expense, primarily due to a 2.2 million charge in the prior year associated with branch consolidations, which was partially offset by higher maintenance costs related to additional branches from the Victory acquisition, renovation of existing branches, and higher snow removal costs in the current year. Additionally, there was a 1.3 million decrease in data processing costs as the prior year included a contract termination penalty of 1.3 million on the completion of Victory's core system conversion, and a 545,000 decrease in professional fees due to a reduction in merger-related costs. 
 Income Tax Expense. The Company recorded income tax expense of 26.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021, was 27.3 compared to 26.1 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The higher effective tax rate was primarily due to higher taxable income. Additionally, on April 19, 2021, the Governor of New York signed into law an increase in the tax rate from 6.5 to 7.25 .

Average Balances and Yields 
 The following tables set forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the years indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments have been made, as we had no tax-free interest-earning assets during the years. All average balances are daily average balances based upon amortized costs. Non-accrual loans are included in the computation of average balances. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts, and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense.

Rate/Volume Analysis 
 The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the years indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.

 Asset Quality 
 PCD Loans (Held-for-Investment) 
 Based on a detailed review of PCD loans and experience in loan workouts, management believes it has a reasonable expectation about the amount and timing of future cash flows and accordingly has classified PCD loans of 11.5 million at December 31, 2022 and 15.8 million at December 31, 2021 as accruing, even though they may be contractually past due. At December 31, 2022, 6.8 of PCD loans were past due 30 to 89 days, and 23.0 were past due 90 days or more, as compared to 10.5 and 19.2 , respectively, at December 31, 2021. 
 Loans 
 General. Maintaining loan quality historically has been, and will continue to be, a key element of our business strategy. We employ conservative underwriting standards for new loan originations and maintain sound credit administration practices while the loans are outstanding. In addition, substantially all of our loans are secured, predominantly by real estate. At December 31, 2022, our non-performing loans totaled 10.2 million, or 0.24 , of total loans. At the same time, net charge-offs have remained low at 0.02 of average loans outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 0.07 for the year ended December 31, 2021, and 0.11 for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Non-performing Assets and Delinquent Loans. The following table details non-performing assets consisting of non-performing loans held-for-investment and non-performing loans held-for-sale at December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): 
 December 31, 2022 2021 Non-accrual loans: Held-for-investment 6,548 4,403 Non-accruing loans subject to restructuring agreements: Held-for-investment 3,265 3,219 Total non-accruing loans held-for-investment 9,813 7,622 Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing: Held-for-investment 425 384 Total non-performing loans 10,238 8,006 Other real estate owned 100 Total non-performing assets 10,238 8,106 Loans subject to restructuring agreements and still accruing 3,751 5,820 Accruing loans 30 to 89 days delinquent 3,644 1,166 
 
 The following table details non-performing loans by loan type at December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): 
 
 December 31, 2022 2021 Held-for-investment Real estate loans: Multifamily 3,285 1,882 Commercial 5,184 5,117 One-to-four family residential 118 314 Home equity and lines of credit 262 281 Commercial and industrial 964 28 Total non-accrual loans held-for-investment 9,813 7,622 Loans delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing: Real estate loans: Multifamily 233 Commercial 8 147 One-to-four family residential 155 165 Commercial and industrial 24 72 Other 5 Total loans delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing held-for-investment 425 384 Total non-performing loans 10,238 8,006 Other real estate owned 100 Total non-performing assets 10,238 8,106

At December 31, 2022, the Company had no assets acquired through foreclosure. As of December 31, 2021, other real estate owned was comprised of one property located in New Jersey, which had a carrying value of approximately 100,000, and which was sold during the second quarter of 2022 for an immaterial gain. 
 Generally, loans, excluding PCD loans, are placed on non-accruing status when they become 90 days or more delinquent, and remain on non-accrual status until they are brought current, have six consecutive months of performance under the loan terms, and factors indicating reasonable doubt about the timely collection of payments no longer exist. Therefore, loans may be current in accordance with their loan terms, or may be less than 90 days delinquent and still be on a non-accruing status. 
 The following table sets forth the total amounts of delinquencies for accruing loans that were 30 to 89 days past due by type and by amount at the dates indicated (in thousands): December 31, 2022 2021 Real estate loans: Multifamily 189 Commercial 900 144 One-to-four family residential 672 593 Home equity and lines of credit 830 412 Commercial and industrial loans 1,048 2 Other loans 5 15 3,644 1,166 
 Included in non-accruing loans held-for-investment are TDR loans totaling 3.3 million and 3.2 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2022, three of the non-accruing TDRs totaling 547,000 were not performing in accordance with their restructured terms. Two of the loans totaling 477,000 are collateralized by real estate with an appraised value of 2.4 million. A third loan in the amount of 70,000 is an unsecured commercial and industrial loan which has a provision against it. At December 31, 2021, one of the non-accruing TDRs totaling 368,000 was not performing in accordance with its restructured terms, and is collateralized by real estate with an appraised value of 620,000. 
 
 The Company also holds loans held-for-investment subject to restructuring agreements that are on accrual status, which totaled 3.8 million and 5.8 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2022, 3.6 million, or 98.4 of the 3.8 million of accruing loans subject to restructuring agreements, were performing in accordance with their restructured terms. At December 31, 2021, 5.7 million, or 97.5 of the 5.8 million of accruing loans subject to restructuring agreements, were performing in accordance with their restructured terms. Generally, the types of concessions that we make to troubled borrowers include both temporary and permanent reductions to interest rates, extensions of payment terms, and, to a lesser extent, forgiveness of principal and interest. 
 
 The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of TDRs as of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021 (in thousands): 
 At December 31, 2022 2021 Non-Accruing Accruing Non-Accruing Accruing Real estate loans: Commercial 3,069 3,034 3,219 3,508 One-to-four family residential 666 1,562 Multifamily 126 603 Home equity and lines of credit 27 38 Commercial and industrial loans 70 24 109 3,265 3,751 3,219 5,820 Performing in accordance with restructured terms 83.2 94.8 88.6 97.5

 On January 1, 2021, the Company adopted the CECL standard and as a result of the adoption recorded a 10.4 million increase to its allowance for credit losses on loans, including 6.8 million related to PCD loans. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses to non-performing loans decreased from 486.60 at December 31, 2021 to 416.26 at December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in non-performing loans of 2.2 million, from 8.1 million at December 31, 2021 to 10.2 million at December 31, 2022. 
 
 The Company utilizes external appraisals to determine the fair value of the underlying collateral in its analysis of impaired loans. A third-party appraisal is generally ordered as soon as a loan is designated as an impaired loan and updated annually, or more frequently if required. Generally, non-performing loans are charged down to the appraised value of collateral less costs to sell for collateral-dependent loans and to the present value of the expected future cash flows for non-collateral dependent loans, which reduces the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans. Downward adjustments to appraisal values, primarily to reflect quick sale discounts, are generally recorded as specific reserves within the allowance for loan losses. 
 The allowance for credit losses to total loans held-for-investment, net, was 1.00 (1.01 excluding PPP loans which are fully government guaranteed and do not carry any allowance for credit losses) at December 31, 2022, as compared to 1.02 and 1.03 , respectively, at December 31, 2021. The slight decrease in the coverage ratio from December 31, 2021 was primarily attributable growth in the portfolio from 3.81 billion at December 31, 2021, to 4.24 billion at December 31, 2022. Net charge-offs were 838,000, 2.8 million, and 3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. 
 Specific reserves on loans individually evaluated for impairment increased by 8,000, or 26.5 , from 30,200 at December 31, 2021, to 38,200 at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, the Company had 20 loans classified as individually impaired and recorded 38,200 of specific reserves on four of the 20 impaired loans. At December 31, 2021, the Company had 25 loans classified as individually impaired and recorded 30,200 of specific reserves on four of the 25 impaired loans.

 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded net charge-offs of 838,000, as compared to net charge-offs of 2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and net charge-offs of 3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Charge-offs in 2022 and 2021 were primarily related to PCD loans and unsecured commercial and industrial loans. Charge-offs in 2020 were primarily related to high risk, commercial real estate accommodation (hotel/motel) loans on COVID-19 forbearance that were transferred to held-for-sale. The increase in the allowance for credit losses from 2021 to 2022 for commercial, one-to-four family residential loans, construction and land loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, and commercial and industrial loans was primarily attributable to growth in the portfolios and a worsening macroeconomic outlook. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses for PCD loans was primarily attributable to a decrease in the PCD portfolio in 2022 due to payoffs of loans.

Management of Market Risk 
 General . A majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Consequently, our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk. Our assets, consisting primarily of mortgage-related securities and loans, generally have longer maturities than our liabilities, which consist primarily of deposits and wholesale borrowings. As a result, a principal part of our business strategy involves managing interest rate risk and limiting the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, our Board of Directors has established a Management Asset-Liability Committee, comprised of our Senior Vice President ("SVP") Chief Investment Officer and Treasurer, who chairs this Committee, our President Chief Executive Officer, our Executive Vice President ("EVP") Chief Risk Officer, our EVP Chief Financial Officer, our SVP Chief Credit Officer and our SVP Director of Marketing, and other officers and staff as necessary or appropriate. This Committee is responsible for, among other things, evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for recommending to the risk management committee of our Board of Directors the level of risk that is appropriate given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. 
 We seek to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates. As part of our ongoing asset-liability management, we currently use the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk: 
 originating multifamily loans and commercial real estate loans that generally have shorter maturities than one-to-four family residential real estate loans and have higher interest rates that generally reset from five to ten years; 
 investing in investment grade corporate securities and mortgage-backed securities; and 
 obtaining general financing through lower-cost core deposits, brokered deposits, and longer-term FHLB advances and repurchase agreements. 
 Shortening the average term of our interest-earning assets by increasing our investments in shorter-term assets, as well as originating loans with variable interest rates, helps to match the maturities and interest rates of our assets and liabilities better, thereby reducing the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. 
 Net Portfolio Value Analysis . We compute amounts by which the net present value of our assets and liabilities (net portfolio value or NPV) would change in the event market interest rates changed over an assumed range of rates. Our simulation model uses a discounted cash flow analysis to measure the interest rate sensitivity of our NPV. Depending on current market interest rates, we estimate the economic value of these assets and liabilities under the assumption that interest rates experience an instantaneous and sustained increase of 100, 200, 300, or 400 basis points, or a decrease of 100 and 200 basis points, which is based on the current interest rate environment. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from 3 to 4 would mean, for example, a 100 basis point increase in the Change in Interest Rates column below. 
 Net Interest Income Analysis. In addition to NPV calculations, we analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through our net interest income model. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. In our model, we estimate what our net interest income would be for a twelve-month period. Depending on current market interest rates we then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period under the assumption that interest rates experience an instantaneous and sustained increase of 100, 200, 300, or 400 basis points, or a decrease of 100 and 200 basis points, which is based on the current interest rate environment. 
 68 

The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our calculation of the estimated changes in our NPV, NPV ratio, and percent change in net interest income that would result from the designated instantaneous and sustained changes in interest rates (dollars in thousands). Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit repricing characteristics including decay rates, and correlations to movements in interest rates, and should not be relied on as indicative of actual results.

 The table above indicates that at December 31, 2022, in the event of a 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would experience a 1.96 increase in estimated net portfolio value, a 0 change in net interest income in year one, and an 8.91 decrease in net income in year two. In the event of a 400 basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a 22.31 decrease in estimated net portfolio value, a 25.83 decrease in net interest income in year one and an 11.03 decrease in net interest income in year two.

 The table above indicates that at December 31, 2021, in the event of a 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would experience a 2.79 increase in estimated net portfolio value, a 6.02 decrease in net interest income in year one and a 11.42 decrease in net income in year two. In the event of a 400 basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a 13.48 decrease in estimated net portfolio value, a 14.49 increase in net interest income in year one and a 4.48 increase in net interest income in year two. 
 Our policies provide that, in the event of a 200 basis point decrease or less in interest rates, our net present value ratio should decrease by no more than 300 basis points and 10 , and in the event of a 400 basis point increase or less, our net present value should decrease by no more than 475 basis points and 35 . In the event of a 200 basis point decrease or less, our projected net interest income should decrease by no more than 10 in year one and 16 in year two, and in the event of a 400 basis point increase or less, our projected net interest income should decrease by no more than 38 in year one and 26 in year two. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all Board-approved policies with respect to interest rate risk management. 
 69 

Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in determining interest rate risk through changes in net portfolio value and net interest income. Our model requires us to make certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. However, we also apply consistent parallel yield curve shifts (in both directions) to determine possible changes in net interest income if the theoretical yield curve shifts occurred gradually. Net interest income analysis also adjusts the asset and liability repricing analysis based on changes in prepayment rates resulting from the parallel yield curve shifts. In addition, the net portfolio value and net interest income information presented assume that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although interest rate risk calculations provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net portfolio value or net interest income and will differ from actual results. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is the ability to fund assets and meet obligations as they come due. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments, borrowings through repurchase agreements, advances from money center banks and the FHLBNY, and repayments, maturities and sales of securities. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are reasonably predictable sources of funds, deposit flows, mortgage prepayments and security sales are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our Board Risk Committee is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and withdrawals of deposits by our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies. We seek to maintain a ratio of liquid assets (not subject to pledge or encumbered) as a percentage of deposits and borrowings of 35 or greater. At December 31, 2022, this ratio was 49.60 . We believe that we had sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy our short- and long-term liquidity needs at December 31, 2022. 
 We regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based on our assessment of: 
 expected loan demand; 
 expected deposit flows; 
 yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities; and 
 the objectives of our asset/liability management program. 
 Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, corporate bonds, and unpledged mortgage-related securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac, that we can either borrow against or sell. We also have the ability to surrender bank-owned life insurance contracts. The surrender of these contracts would subject the Company to income taxes and penalties for increases in the cash surrender values over the original premium payments. We also have the ability to obtain additional funding from the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank utilizing unencumbered and unpledged securities and multifamily loans. Any amount pledged for such deposits under the line of credit reduces the Company's available borrowing amount under the FHLB advance agreement. The Company continues to maintain an adequate liquidity position and expects to have sufficient funds available to meet current commitments in the normal course of business. 
 The Company had the following primary sources of liquidity at December 31, 2022 (in thousands): 
 Cash and cash equivalents (1) 
 31,269 Corporate bonds (2) 
 168,032 Multifamily loans (2) 
 1,573,615 Mortgage-backed securities (issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac) (2) 
 191,821 
 (1) Excludes 14.5 million of cash at Northfield Bank. 
 (2) Represents remaining borrowing potential. 
 70 

At December 31, 2022, we had 37.5 million in outstanding loan commitments. In addition, we had 288.4 million in unused lines of credit to borrowers. Certificates of deposit due within one year of December 31, 2022 totaled 685.3 million, or 16.5 of total deposits. If these deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including loan sales, securities sales, other deposit products, including replacement certificates of deposit, securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements), and advances from the FHLBNY and other borrowing sources. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit. Based on experience, we believe that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us, and we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered. 
 We have a detailed contingency funding plan that is reviewed and reported to the Board Risk Committee at least quarterly. This plan includes monitoring cash on a daily basis to determine the liquidity needs of Northfield Bank. Additionally, management performs a stress test on Northfield Bank s retail deposits and wholesale funding sources in several scenarios on a quarterly basis. The stress scenarios include deposit attrition of up to 50 , and selling our securities available-for-sale portfolio at a discount of 20 to its current estimated fair value. Northfield Bank continues to maintain significant liquidity under all stress scenarios. 
 Northfield Bancorp, Inc. is a separate legal entity from Northfield Bank and must provide for its own liquidity to fund dividend payments, stock repurchases, and other corporate items. The Company s primary source of liquidity is the receipt of dividend payments from the Bank in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2022, Northfield Bancorp, Inc. (unconsolidated) had liquid assets of 40.0 million. 
 Northfield Bank and Northfield Bancorp, Inc. are both subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At December 31, 2022, both Northfield Bank and Northfield Bancorp, Inc. exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and are considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines. See Item 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation and Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations 
 Commitments. As a financial services provider, we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit, and unused lines of credit. While these contractual obligations represent our potential future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process applicable to loans we originate. In addition, we routinely enter into commitments to sell mortgage loans; such amounts are not significant to our operations. For additional information, see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 
 Our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The effect of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater effect on our performance than inflation.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 Northfield Bancorp, Inc.: 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Northfield Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 1, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Change in Accounting Principle 
 As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has elected to change its method of accounting for the recognition and measurement of credit losses as of January 1, 2021 due to the adoption of ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 72 

Allowance for credit losses for loans evaluated on a collective basis 
 As discussed in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s total allowance for credit losses on loans as of December 31, 2022 was 42.6 million, of which 38.7 million related to the allowance for credit losses on loans evaluated on a collective basis (collective ACL). Loans that share similar risk characteristics are grouped into portfolio pools for collective evaluation. The Company s collective ACL consists of a quantitative component and qualitative adjustments. To estimate the quantitative component of the collective ACL, the Company uses a risk rating migration model that calculates an expected life-of-loan loss percentage for each loan by generating probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) metrics. These metrics are multiplied by the exposure at default (EAD), taking into consideration prepayments, to calculate the quantitative component of the collective ACL. These metrics consider a variety of factors such as the migration of loans from performing to loss by credit risk rating or delinquency categories using historical life-of-loan analysis periods for each loan portfolio pool, the Company s own historical loss experience over the historical life-of-loan analysis periods, comparable peer data loss history over the historical life-of-loan analysis periods, as well as economic scenarios over a reasonable and supportable forecast period, after which the Company immediately reverts to historical loss experience for the remaining life of the loans. The collective ACL also includes qualitative adjustments to address risks that may not be adequately represented in the risk rating migration model. 
 
 We identified the assessment of the collective ACL as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the collective ACL due to significant measurement uncertainty. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the (1) risk rating migration model used to estimate the PD and LGD metrics, (2) the key assumptions for the risk rating migration model, including credit risk ratings, the reasonable and supportable forecast period including the reversion method, the selection and weighting of multiple economic scenarios, and estimated prepayments, and (3) the qualitative adjustments, including the significant assumptions used in the measurement of the qualitative adjustments. The assessment also included an evaluation of the conceptual soundness and performance of the risk rating migration model. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained. 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company s measurement of the collective ACL estimate, including controls over the: 
 development of the collective ACL methodology, including the selection of the risk rating migration model 
 continued use and appropriateness of the risk rating migration model 
 identification and determination of the key assumptions used to estimate the PD and LGD in the risk rating migration model 
 development of the qualitative adjustments, including the significant assumptions used in the measurement of the qualitative adjustments 
 analysis of the collective ACL results, trends, and ratios. 
 We evaluated the Company s process to develop the collective ACL estimate by testing certain sources of data, factors, and assumptions that the Company used, and considered the relevance and reliability of such data, factors and assumptions. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: 
 evaluating the Company s collective ACL methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 
 evaluating judgments made by the Company relative to the assessment of the risk rating migration model by comparing them to relevant Company-specific metrics and trends and the applicable industry and regulatory practices 
 assessing the conceptual soundness and performance testing of the risk rating migration model by inspecting the model documentation to determine whether the model is suitable for its intended use 
 evaluating the selection and weighting of the economic forecast scenarios by comparing them to the Company s business environment and relevant industry practices 
 evaluating the length of the reasonable and supportable forecast period and reversion method by comparing them to specific portfolio risk characteristics and trends 
 evaluating judgments made by management in developing estimated prepayments by comparing to specific portfolio risk characteristics and trends 
 testing individual credit risk ratings for a selection of commercial loans by evaluating the financial performance of the borrower, sources of repayment, and any relevant guarantees or underlying collateral 
 73 

evaluating the methodology used to develop the qualitative adjustments and the effect of those adjustments on the collective ACL compared with relevant credit risk factors and consistency with credit trends and the identified limitations of the underlying risk rating migration model. 
 We also assessed the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained related to the collective ACL by evaluating the: 
 cumulative results of the audit procedures 
 qualitative aspects of the Company s accounting practices 
 potential bias in the accounting estimates.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 Northfield Bancorp, Inc.: 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited Northfield Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated March 1, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

million increase to its allowance for credit losses, including reserves of million related to loans and related to unfunded credit commitments. Of the million increase in loan reserves, million represents PCD loan-related reserves which were recognized through a gross-up that increases the amortized cost basis of loans with a corresponding increase to the allowance for credit losses, and therefore results in no impact to shareholders' equity. The non-PCD loan related increase to the allowance for credit losses of million, including the reserves for unfunded loan commitments, was offset in shareholders' equity and deferred tax assets.

 or greater and all loans restructured in troubled debt restructurings TDRs ). Loan held-for-investment are individually assessed to determine that the loan s carrying value is not in excess of the expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate, or the fair value of the underlying collateral (less estimated costs to sell) if the loan is collateral dependent. Impairments, if any, are recognized through a charge to the allowance for credit losses on loans for the amount that the loan s carrying value exceeds the discounted cash flow analysis or estimated fair value of collateral (less estimated costs to sell) if the loan is collateral dependent. Such amounts are charged-off when considered appropriate. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 
 
 Under ASU 2016-13 the Company determines the allowance for credit losses on loans based upon a consideration of its historical portfolio loss experience, current borrower-specific risk characteristics, current conditions, forecasts of future economic conditions, reversion period, prepayments, and qualitative adjustments. The allowance is measured on a collective (loan segment) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Loans that do not share common risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis and are excluded from the collective evaluation. Accrued interest on loans is excluded from the calculation of the allowance for credit losses due to the Company's non-accrual policy which results in the reversal of uncollectible accrued interest on non-accrual loans against interest income in a timely manner. Accrued interest receivable on loans held-for-investment totaled million and million, respectively, at December 31, 2022 and 2021 and is reported in accrued interest receivable on the consolidated balance sheets . 
 
 Allowance for Collectively Evaluated Loans Held-for-Investment . In estimating the quantitative component of the allowance on a collective basis, the Company uses a risk rating migration model which calculates an expected life of loan loss percentage for each loan by generating probability of default and loss given default metrics. These metrics are multiplied by the exposure at default, taking into consideration prepayments, to calculate the quantitative component of the allowance. The metrics are based on the migration of loans from performing to loss by credit risk rating or delinquency categories using historical life-of-loan analysis periods for each loan portfolio pool, and the severity of loss, based on the aggregate net lifetime losses incurred using the Company's own historical loss experience and comparable peer data loss history. The model's expected losses based on loss history are adjusted for qualitative adjustments to address risks that may not be adequately represented in the risk rating migration model. Among other things, these adjustments include and account for differences in: (i) changes in lending policies and procedures; (ii) changes in local, regional, national, and international economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of our portfolio, including the condition of various market segments; (iii) changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; (iv) changes in the quality of our loan review system; (v) the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations; and (vi) the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in our existing portfolio.

 or greater. Loans individually evaluated for impairment are assessed to determine that the loan s carrying value is not in excess of the estimated fair value of the collateral less cost to sell, if the loan is collateral-dependent, or the present value of the expected future cash flows, if the loan is not collateral-dependent. Management performs an evaluation of each impaired loan and generally obtains updated appraisals as part of the evaluation. In addition, management adjusts estimated fair values down to appropriately consider recent market conditions, our willingness to accept a lower sales price to effect a quick sale, and costs to dispose of any supporting collateral. Determining the estimated fair value of underlying collateral (and related costs to sell) can be difficult in illiquid real estate markets and is subject to significant assumptions and estimates. Management employs an independent third-party management firm that specializes in appraisal preparation and review to ascertain the reasonableness of updated appraisals. Projecting the expected cash flows under troubled debt restructurings which are not collateral-dependent is inherently subjective and requires, among other things, an evaluation of the borrower s current and projected financial condition. Individually impaired loans that have no impairment losses are not considered for collective allowances described above. 
 The Company elected to exclude accrued interest on loans from the amortized cost of loans held for investment. The accrued interest is reported in accrued interest receivable on the consolidated balance shee t and totaled million and million, respectively, at December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 PCD Loans 
 The Company adopted CECL using the prospective transition approach for PCD loans that were previously classified as PCI loans and accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification ASC Subtopic 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality. In accordance with the standard, management did not reassess whether PCI loans met the criteria of PCD loans as of the date of adoption. On January 1, 2021, the amortized cost basis of the PCD assets was adjusted to reflect the addition of the 6.8 million of the allowance for credit losses. The remaining noncredit discount (based on the adjusted amortized cost basis) will be accreted into interest income at the effective interest rate as of January 1, 2021. 
 
 Upon adoption of CECL, the Company elected to maintain pools of loans that were previously accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-30 and will continue to account for these pools as a unit of account. Loans are only removed from existing pools if they are written off, paid off, or sold. Upon adoption of CECL, the allowance for credit losses was determined for each pool and added to the pool's carrying amount to establish a new amortized cost basis. The difference between the unpaid principal balance of the pool and the new amortized cost basis is the noncredit premium or discount which will be amortized into interest income over the remaining life of the pool. Changes to the allowance for credit losses after adoption are recorded through provision expense. 
 
 The Company also maintains a reserve for estimated losses on off-balance sheet credit risks related to loan commitments and stand-by letters of credit. The reserve for off-balance sheet exposures is determined using the CECL reserve factor in the related funded loan segment, adjusted for an average historical funding rate. The allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and the corresponding provision is included in other non-interest expense.

 days, which could be extended for an additional days, for a maximum of days on a cumulative basis, with modifications in the form of payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment. In accordance with regulatory guidance under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act of 2020 (the CARES Act ), the Consolidated Appropriations Act, and other regulatory guidance, these loan deferrals were not considered TDRs and not reported as past due or non-accrual during the deferral period. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no material deferrals related to the CARES Act. 
 A loan is considered past due when it is not paid in accordance with its contractual terms. The accrual of income on loans, including impaired loans held-for-investment, and other loans in the process of foreclosure, is generally discontinued when a loan becomes 90 days or more delinquent, or sooner when certain factors indicate that the ultimate collection of principal and interest is in doubt. Loans on which the accrual of income has been discontinued are designated as non-accrual loans. All previously accrued interest is reversed against interest income, and income is recognized subsequently only in the period that cash is received, provided no principal payments are due and the remaining principal balance outstanding is deemed collectible. A non-accrual loan is not returned to accrual status until both principal and interest payments are brought current and factors indicating doubtful collection no longer exist, including performance by the borrower under the loan terms for a consecutive six-month period.

The Company qualitatively assessed the current economic environment, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions and overall financial performance of the Company, among others. After consideration of the results of the annual 2022 impairment test and the results for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company determined that it was more-likely-than-not that the fair value of its reporting unit was above its book value as of December 31, 2022, which did not indicate impairment for our reporting unit, nor was our reporting unit at risk. The Company will test goodwill for impairment between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the fair value of the reporting unit is below its carrying amount.

 The Company's held-to-maturity securities are residential mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and it is expected that the securities will not be settled at prices less than the amortized cost bases of the securities as such securities are backed by the full faith and credit of and/or guaranteed by the U.S. Government. Accordingly, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded for these securities. 
 
 The Company has made the accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest receivable on held-to-maturity securities from the estimate of credit losses. Accrued interest receivable associated with held-to-maturity securities totaling and , respectively, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was reported in accrued interest receivable on the consolidated balance sheets .

As the SBA Loan Fund operates as a private fund, its shares are not publicly traded and, therefore, have no readily determinable market value. The SBA Loan Fund was recorded at net asset value as a practical expedient for reporting fair value.

 The Company had loans held-for-sale at December 31, 2022 or 2021. 
 
 In addition to originating loans, the Company may acquire loans through portfolio purchases or acquisitions of other companies. Purchased loans that have evidence of more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination are deemed PCD loans. For PCD loans, each loan pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. PCD loans totaled million at December 31, 2022, as compared to million at December 31, 2021. The majority of the PCD loan balance was attributable to those loans acquired as part of a FDIC-assisted transaction. At December 31, 2022, PCD loans consisted of approximately one-to-four family residential loans, commercial real estate loans, and commercial and industrial loans, and in home equity loans. At December 31, 2021, PCD loans consisted of approximately one-to-four family residential loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, and in construction and land and home equity loans. 
 
 Credit Quality Indicators 
 
 The Company monitors the credit quality of its loan portfolio on a regular basis. Credit quality is monitored by reviewing certain credit quality indicators. Management has determined that loan-to-value LTV ratios (at period end) and internally assigned credit risk ratings by loan type are the key credit quality indicators that best measure the credit quality of the Company s loan receivables. LTV used by management in monitoring credit quality are based on current period loan balances and original appraised values at the time of origination (unless a current appraisal has been obtained as a result of the loan being deemed impaired). 
 
 The Company maintains a credit risk rating system as part of the risk assessment of its loan portfolio. The Company s lending officers are required to assign a credit risk rating to each loan in their portfolio at origination. This risk rating is reviewed periodically and adjusted if necessary. Monthly, management presents monitored assets to the loan committee. In addition, the Company engages a third-party independent loan reviewer that performs semi-annual reviews of a sample of loans, validating the credit risk ratings assigned to such loans. The credit risk ratings play an important role in the establishment of the provision for credit losses on loans and the allowance for credit losses for loans held-for-investment. After determining the loss factor for each portfolio segment held-for-investment, the collectively evaluated for impairment balance of the held-for-investment portfolio is multiplied by the collectively evaluated for impairment loss factor for the respective portfolio segment in order to determine the allowance for loans collectively evaluated for impairment.

million and million at December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. Generally, originated loans are placed on non-accrual status when they become days or more delinquent, or sooner if considered appropriate by management, and remain on non-accrual status until they are brought current, have six consecutive months of performance under the loan terms, and factors indicating reasonable doubt about the timely collection of payments no longer exist. Therefore, loans may be current in accordance with their loan terms, or may be less than days delinquent and still be on a non-accruing status. 
 
 When an individual loan no longer demonstrates the similar credit risk characteristics as other loans within its current segment, the Company evaluates each for expected credit losses on an individual basis.

The non-accrual amounts included in loans individually evaluated for impairment were million and million at December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively.

 There were commercial and industrial loans to borrowers modified as TDRs during the year ended December 31, 2021, which were modified to reduce the interest rate, extend the maturity date, and restructure payment terms of the loans. 
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had TDRs of million and million, respectively. 
 Management classifies all TDRs as loans individually evaluated for impairment. Loans individually evaluated for impairment are assessed to determine that the loan s carrying value is not in excess of the estimated fair value of the collateral less cost to sell, if the loan is collateral-dependent, or the present value of the expected future cash flows, if the loan is not collateral-dependent. Management performs an evaluation of each impaired loan and generally obtains updated appraisals as part of the evaluation. In addition, management adjusts estimated fair values down to appropriately consider recent market conditions, our willingness to accept a lower sales price to effect a quick sale, and costs to dispose of any supporting collateral. Determining the estimated fair value of underlying collateral (and related costs to sell) can be difficult in illiquid real estate markets and is subject to significant assumptions and estimates. Management employs an independent third-party management firm that specializes in appraisal preparation and review to ascertain the reasonableness of updated appraisals. Projecting the expected cash flows under TDRs which are not collateral-dependent is inherently subjective and requires, among other things, an evaluation of the borrower s current and projected financial condition. Actual results may be significantly different than our projections and our established allowance for credit losses on these loans, which could have a material effect on our financial results.

 The allowance for credit losses on loans increased to million at December 31, 2022, compared to million at December 31, 2021, primarily due to growth in the loan portfolio as well as a declining macroeconomic forecast, partially offset by an improvement in asset quality and lower net charge-offs. The improvement in asset quality is primarily attributable to an improvement in risk ratings as loans previously modified for COVID-19 relief returned to consistent payment status.

 On July 1, 2018, the State of New Jersey enacted legislation which established a 2.5 surtax on businesses that have New Jersey allocated net income in excess of 1.0 million. As originally enacted, the surtax was effective as of January 1, 2018 and continued through 2019, and was scheduled to decrease to 1.5 for 2020 and 2021, and expired beginning on or after January 1, 2022. Legislation enacted on September 29, 2020, extended the surtax rate of 2.5 through December 31, 2023, to be applied retrospectively to January 1, 2020. In addition, effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2019, banks are required to file combined reports of taxable income including their parent holding company. In May 2019, the State of New Jersey issued a tax technical bulletin, subsequently revised in December 2019, which gives guidance on the treatment of real estate investment trusts in connection with the combined reporting for New Jersey corporate business tax purposes. Real estate investment trusts and investment companies will be excluded from the combined group and will continue to file separate New Jersey tax returns.

 Net deferred tax assets are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. On January 1, 2021, the Company recorded million of deferred tax assets as a result of the adoption of CECL. 
 
 The Company has determined that it is not required to establish a valuation reserve for the deferred tax asset since it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. The conclusion that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized is based on the history of earnings and the prospects for continued profitability. Management will continue to review the tax criteria related to the recognition of deferred tax assets.

The unamortized fee on standby letters of credit approximates their fair value; such fees were insignificant at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses on commitments to extend credit in other liabilities. The reserve for off-balance sheet exposures is determined using the CECL reserve factor in the related funded loan segment, adjusted for an average historical funding rate. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the allowance was and million, respectively, and is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The corresponding provision is included in other non-interest expense. For further details on the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet exposures refer to Note 7 - Allowance for Credit Losses ACL on Loans.

 Under prompt corrective action regulations, the OCC is required to take certain supervisory actions (and may take additional discretionary actions) with respect to an undercapitalized institution. Such actions could have a direct material effect on the institution s financial statements. The regulations establish a framework for the classification of savings institutions into five categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. Generally, an institution is considered well capitalized if it has a leverage (Tier 1) ratio of or greater, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of or greater, and a total risk-based capital ratio of or greater. 
 
 The foregoing capital ratios are based in part on specific quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications also are subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about capital components, risk weighting, and other factors. 
 
 Under the U.S. Basel III capital framework, both Northfield Bank and the Company must maintain minimum capital requirements which include: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of ; (ii) a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of ; (iii) a total capital to risk-based assets of ; and (iv) a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio of . In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.

 The valuation techniques described below were used to measure fair value of financial instruments in the tables below on a recurring basis and a non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 Debt Securities Available-for-Sale: The estimated fair values for mortgage-backed securities, corporate, and other debt securities are obtained from an independent nationally recognized third-party pricing service. The estimated fair values are derived primarily from cash flow models, which include assumptions for interest rates, credit losses, and prepayment speeds. Broker/dealer quotes are utilized as well, when such quotes are available and deemed representative of the market. The significant inputs utilized in the cash flow models are based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company (Observable Inputs), and are therefore classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers of securities between Level 1 and Level 2 during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 Trading Securities: Fair values are derived from quoted market prices in active markets. The assets consist of publicly traded mutual funds. 
 
 Equity Securities: Fair values of equity securities consisting of publicly traded mutual funds are derived from quoted market prices in active markets. 
 
 Loans Individually Evaluated for Impairment: At December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Company had loans individually evaluated for impairment (excluding PCD loans) with outstanding principal balances of million and million, respectively, which were recorded at their estimated fair value of million and million, respectively. The Company recorded a net increase in the specific reserve for impaired loans of , and a net decrease in the specific reserve of for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company recorded net charge-offs of for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to net charge-offs of million for the year ended December 31, 2021, utilizing Level 3 inputs. For purposes of estimating the fair value of impaired loans, management utilizes independent appraisals, if the loan is collateral-dependent, adjusted downward by management, as necessary, for changes in relevant valuation factors subsequent to the appraisal date, or the present value of expected future cash flows for non-collateral-dependent loans and TDRs. 
 
 Other Real Estate Owned: At December 31, 2022, the Company had assets acquired through foreclosure. At December 31, 2021, the Company had other real estate owned of approximately , recorded at estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs when acquired, thus establishing a new cost basis. The property was located in New Jersey and was sold during the second quarter of 2022 for a small gain. Estimated fair value is generally based on independent appraisals. These appraisals include adjustments to comparable assets based on the appraisers market knowledge and experience, and are considered Level 3 inputs. When an asset is acquired, the excess of the loan balance over fair value, less estimated selling costs, is charged to the allowance for credit losses. If the estimated fair value of the asset declines, a write-down is recorded through non-interest expense. The valuation of foreclosed assets is subjective in nature and may be adjusted in the future because of changes in the economic conditions. 
 
 In addition, the Company may be required, from time to time, to measure the fair value of certain other financial assets on a non-recurring basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The adjustments to fair value usually result from the application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write downs of individual assets.

 Limitations 
 
 Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected losses, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. 
 
 Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates.

Any repurchased shares will be held as treasury stock and will be available for general corporate purposes. The repurchases may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason, including market conditions, the cost of repurchasing shares, the availability of alternative investment opportunities, liquidity, and other factors deemed appropriate.

 up to years. At December 31, 2022, all of the Company's leases are classified as operating leases, which are required to be recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability. 
 
 The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Right-of-use assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recorded at the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, at lease inception, over a similar term in determining the present value of lease payments. Certain leases include options to renew, with one or more renewal terms ranging from five to . If the exercise of a renewal option is considered to be reasonably certain, the Company includes the extended term in the calculation of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company s operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheet were million and million, respectively. At December 31, 2021, the Company s operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheet were million and million, respectively. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while variable lease payments are recognized as incurred. Variable lease payments include common area maintenance charges, real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance costs and utilities. Operating and variable lease expenses are recorded in occupancy expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Steven M. Klein, our Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer, and William R. Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) or (the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022. Based upon their evaluation, they each found that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date. 
 
 Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company s internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. 
 
 Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 The Company s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment we conclude that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. 
 
 The Company s independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, and it is included in Item 8, under Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This report appears on page 75 of this document.

 4.1.1 The Employer shall credit to the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account on each Crediting Date an amount equal to the total Participant Deferral Credit for the period ending on such Crediting Date. 
 
 4.1.2 An election pursuant to this Section 4.1 shall be made by the Participant by executing and delivering a Participation Agreement to the Committee. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.1, the Participation Agreement shall become effective with respect to such Participant as of the first day of January following the date such Participation Agreement is received by the Committee. A Participant's election may be changed at any time prior to the last permissible date for making the election as permitted in this Section 4.1, and shall thereafter be irrevocable. Any election of a Participant shall continue in effect for the time period as set forth in the Adoption Agreement. 
 
 4.1.3 A Participant may execute and deliver a Participation Agreement to the Committee within 30 days after the date the Participant first becomes eligible to participate in the Plan. After the 30-day period expires, or after any shorter time period as agreed to by the Participant and the Committee, the latest election made by the Participant during that period becomes irrevocable. Such election shall then be effective as of the first payroll period commencing following the date the Participation Agreement becomes irrevocable. Whether a Participant is treated as newly eligible for participation under this Section shall be determined in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder, including (i) rules that treat all elective deferral account balance plans as one plan, and (ii) rules that treat a previously eligible Employee as newly eligible if the Participant s benefits had been previously distributed or if the Participant has been ineligible for 24 months. For Compensation that is earned based upon a specified 
 
 10 

performance period (for example, an annual bonus), where a deferral election is made under this Section but after the beginning of the performance period, the election will only apply to the portion of the Compensation equal to the total amount of the Compensation for the service period multiplied by the ratio of the number of days remaining in the performance period after the date the election becomes irrevocable over the total number of days in the performance period. 
 
 4.1.4 A Participant may unilaterally modify a Participation Agreement (either to terminate, increase or decrease future Compensation which is subject to deferral within the percentage limits set forth in Section 4.1 of the Adoption Agreement) by providing a written modification of the Participation Agreement to the Committee. The modification shall become effective as of the first day of January following the date such written modification is received by the Committee, or at such later date as required under Section 409A of the Code. 
 
 4.1.5 If the Participant performed services continuously from the later of the beginning of the performance period or the date upon which the performance criteria are established through the date upon which the Participant makes an initial deferral election, a Participation Agreement relating to the deferral of Performance- Based Compensation may be executed and delivered to the Committee no later than the date which is 6 months prior to the end of the performance period, provided that in no event may an election to defer Performance-Based Compensation be made after such Compensation has become readily ascertainable. 
 
 4.1.6 If the Employer has a fiscal year other than the calendar year, Compensation relating to Service in the fiscal year of the Employer (such as a bonus based on the fiscal year of the Employer), of which no amount is paid or payable during the fiscal year, may be deferred at the Participant's election if the election to defer is made not later than the close of the Employer's fiscal year next preceding the first fiscal year in which the Participant performs any services for which such Compensation is payable. 
 
 4.1.7 Compensation payable after the last day of the Participant's taxable year solely for services provided during the final payroll period containing the last day of the Participant's taxable year (i.e., generally December 31) is treated for purposes of this Section 4.1 as Compensation for services performed in the subsequent taxable year. 
 
 4.1.8 The Committee may from time to time establish policies or rules consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code to govern the manner in which Participant Deferral Credits may be made. 
 
 4.1.9 If a Participant becomes Disabled, all currently effective deferral elections for such Participant shall be cancelled. At the time the participant is no longer Disabled, subsequent elections to defer future compensation will be permitted under this Section 4. 

11 

4.1.10 If a Participant applies for and receives a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency, all currently effective deferral elections for such Participant shall be cancelled. Subsequent elections to defer future compensation will be permitted under this Section 4. Furthermore, a Participant may apply to the Committee to cancel all deferral elections due to an Unforeseeable Emergency. 
 
 4.2 Employer Credits. If designated by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement, the Employer shall cause the Committee to credit to the Deferred Compensation Account of each Active Participant an Employer Credit as determined in accordance with the Adoption Agreement. A Participant must make distribution elections with respect to any Employer Credits credited to the Deferred Compensation Account by the deadline that would apply under Section 4.1 for distribution elections with respect to Participant Deferral Credits credited at the same time, on a Participation Agreement that is timely executed and delivered to the Committee pursuant to Section 4.1. If no distribution election is made, vested amounts in the Deferred Compensation Account will be distributed in a lump sum upon the earliest of any Qualifying Distribution Event limited to Separation from Service, Disability, Death or Change in Control. 
 4.3. Deferred Compensation Account. All Participant Deferral Credits and Employer Credits shall be credited to the Deferred Compensation Account of the Participant as provided in Section 8. 
 
 Section 5. Qualifying Distribution Events 
 
 5.1 Separation from Service. If the Participant Separates from Service with the Employer, the vested balance in the Deferred Compensation Account shall be paid to the Participant by the Employer as provided in Section 7. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no distribution shall be made earlier than six months after the date of Separation from Service 

12 

(or, if earlier, the date of death) with respect to a Participant who as of the date of Separation from Service is a Specified Employee of a corporation (or a member of such corporation's controlled group) the stock in which is traded on an established securities market (either foreign or domestic) or otherwise. Any payments to which such Specified Employee would be entitled during the first six months following the date of Separation from Service shall be accumulated and paid on the first day of the seventh month following the date of Separation from Service, and shall be adjusted for deemed investment gain and loss incurred during the six month period. 
 5.2 Disability. If the Employer designates in the Adoption Agreement that distributions are permitted under the Plan when a Participant becomes Disabled, and the Participant becomes Disabled while in Service, the vested balance in the Deferred Compensation Account shall be paid to the Participant by the Employer as provided in Section 7. 
 5.3 Death. If the Participant dies while in Service, the Employer shall pay a benefit to the Participant's Beneficiary in the amount of the vested balance in the Deferred Compensation Account and any additional amount designated in the Adoption Agreement. Payment of such benefit shall be made by the Employer as provided in Section 7. 
 5.4 In-Service Distributions. If the Employer designates in the Adoption Agreement that in-service distributions are permitted under the Plan, a Participant may designate in the Participation Agreement to have a specified amount credited to the Participant's In-Service Account for in-service distributions at the date specified by the Participant. In no event may an in- service distribution of an amount be made before the date that is two years after the first day of the year in which any deferral election to such In-Service Account became effective. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Participant incurs a Qualifying Distribution Event prior to the date on which the entire balance in the In-Service Account has been distributed, then the vested 
 13 

balance in the In-Service Account on the date of the Qualifying Distribution Event shall be paid as provided under Section 7.1 for payments on such Qualifying Distribution Event. 
 5.5 Change in Control Event. If the Employer designates in the Adoption Agreement that distributions are permitted under the Plan upon the occurrence of a Change in Control Event, the Participant may designate in the Participation Agreement to have the vested balance in the Deferred Compensation Account paid to the Participant upon a Change in Control Event by the Employer as provided in Section 7. 
 5.6 Unforeseeable Emergency. If the Employer designates in the Adoption Agreement that distributions are permitted under the Plan upon the occurrence of an Unforeseeable Emergency event, a distribution from the Deferred Compensation Account may be made to a Participant in the event of an Unforeseeable Emergency, subject to the following provisions 
 5.6.1 A Participant may, make an application to the Committee to cancel all active deferral elections or to cancel deferral elections and receive a distribution in a lump sum of all or a portion of the vested balance in the Deferred Compensation Account (determined as of the date the distribution, if any, is made under this Section 5.6) because of an Unforeseeable Emergency. A distribution because of an Unforeseeable Emergency shall not exceed the amount required to satisfy the Unforeseeable Emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of such distribution, after taking into account the extent to which the Unforeseeable Emergency may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant's assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship) or by stopping current deferrals under the Plan pursuant to Section 4.1.10. 
 
 5.6.2 The Participant's request for a distribution on account of Unforeseeable Emergency must be made in writing to the Committee. The request must specify the nature of the financial hardship, the total amount requested to be distributed from the Deferred Compensation Account, and the total amount of the actual expense incurred or to be incurred on account of the Unforeseeable Emergency. 
 
 5.6.3 If a cancellation of deferral elections is approved, such cancellation will be effective as soon as practicable. If a distribution under this Section 5.6 is approved by the Committee, such distribution will be made as soon as practicable following 

14 

the date it is approved. The processing of the request shall be completed as soon as practicable from the date on which the Committee receives the properly completed written request for a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency. If a Participant's Separation from Service occurs after a request is approved in accordance with this Section 5.6.3, but prior to distribution of the full amount approved, the approval of the request shall be automatically null and void and the benefits which the Participant is entitled to receive under the Plan shall be distributed in accordance with the applicable distribution provisions of the Plan. 
 
 5.6.4 The Committee may from time to time adopt additional policies or rules consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code to govern the manner in which such distributions may be made so that the Plan may be conveniently administered. 

Section 6. Vesting 
 
 A Participant shall be fully vested in the portion of the Deferred Compensation Account attributable to Participant Deferral Credits, and all income, gains and losses attributable thereto. A Participant shall become fully vested in the portion of the Deferred Compensation Account attributable to Employer Credits, and income, gains and losses attributable thereto, in accordance with the vesting schedule and provisions designated by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement. Once a Participant achieves vesting on an Employer Credit, it cannot be reduced or eliminated. If Change in Control was elected as a vesting event in the Adoption Agreement, participants accounts shall be fully vested upon a Change in Control, however new vesting schedules may be applied to future Employer Credits. If a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account is not fully vested upon Separation from Service, the portion of the Deferred Compensation Account that is not fully vested shall be forfeited. 

15 

Section 7. Distribution Rules 
 
 7.1 Payment Options. The Employer shall designate in the Adoption Agreement the payment options which may be elected by the Participant. The Participant may at such time elect a method of payment for Qualifying Distribution Events as specified in the Adoption Agreement. If the Participant is permitted by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement to elect different payment options and does not make a valid election, the vested balance in the Deferred Compensation Account will be distributed as a lump sum upon the Qualifying Distribution Event. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if certain Qualifying Distribution Events occur prior to the date on which the vested balance of a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account is completely paid pursuant to this Section 7.1 following the occurrence of certain Qualifying Distribution Events, the following rules apply 
 7.1.1 If the currently effective Qualifying Distribution Event is a Separation from Service or Disability, and the Participant subsequently dies, the remaining unpaid vested balance of a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account shall be paid as a lump sum. 
 
 7.1.2 If the currently effective Qualifying Distribution Event is a Change in Control Event, and any subsequent Qualifying Distribution Event occurs (except an In-Service Distribution described in Section 2.29(iv)), the remaining unpaid vested balance of a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account shall be paid as provided under Section 7.1 for payments on such subsequent Qualifying Distribution Event. 
 
 7.2 Timing of Payments. Payment shall be made in the manner elected by the Participant and shall commence as soon as practicable after the distribution date specified for the Qualifying Distribution Event. Distribution shall be no later than within 60 days following the day after the Qualifying Distribution Event. Such payment shall not be deemed late if the payment is made on or before the later of (i) December 31 of the calendar year in which the Qualifying Distribution 
 16 

Event occurs, or (ii) the date that is 2-1 2 months after the Qualifying Distribution Event occurs. Participants shall not have any influence as to the tax year or timing of the distribution. For each payment, the Committee must specify a date for the Deferred Compensation Account(s) to be valued. In the event the Participant fails to make a valid election of the payment method, the distribution will be made in a single lump sum payment as soon as practicable after the Qualifying Distribution Event. A payment may be further delayed to the extent permitted in accordance with regulations and guidance under Section 409A of the Code. 
 7.3 Installment Payments. If the Participant elects to receive installment payments upon a Qualifying Distribution Event, the payment of each installment shall be made on the anniversary of the date of the first installment payment, and the amount of the installment shall be adjusted on such anniversary for credits or debits to the Participant's account pursuant to Section 8 of the Plan. Such adjustment shall be made by dividing the balance in the Deferred Compensation Account on such date by the number of installments remaining to be paid hereunder provided that the last installment due under the Plan shall be the entire amount credited to the Participant's account on the date of payment. 
 7.4 De Minimis Amounts. Notwithstanding any payment election made by the Participant, if the Employer designates a pre-determined de minimis amount in the Adoption Agreement, the vested balance in all Deferred Compensation Accounts of the Participant will be distributed in a single lump sum payment if at the time of a permitted Qualifying Distribution Event the vested balance does not exceed such pre-determined de minimis amount provided, however, that such distribution will be made only where the Qualifying Distribution Event is a Separation from Service, death, Disability, or Change in Control Event. In addition, the Employer may distribute a Participant's vested balance in all of the Participant s Deferred Compensation Accounts at any time if the balance does not exceed the limit in Section 402(g)(1)(B) of the Code 
 
 17 

and results in the termination of the Participant's entire interest in the Plan as provided under Section 409A of the Code. 
 7.5 Subsequent Elections. With the consent of the Committee, a Participant may delay or change the method of payment of the Deferred Compensation Account subject to the following requirements 
 7.5.1 The new election may not take effect until at least 12 months after the date on which the new election is made. 
 
 7.5.2 If the new election relates to a payment for a Qualifying Distribution Event other than the death of the Participant, the Participant becoming Disabled, or an Unforeseeable Emergency, the new election must provide for the deferral of the payment for a period of at least five years from the date such payment would otherwise have been made. 
 
 7.5.3 If the new election relates to a payment from the In-Service Account, the new election must be made at least 12 months prior to the date of the first scheduled payment from such account. 
 
 For purposes of this Section 7.5 and Section 7.6, a payment is each separately identified amount to which the Participant is entitled under the Plan provided, that entitlement to a series of installment payments is treated as the entitlement to a single payment. 
 7.6 Acceleration Prohibited. The acceleration of the time or schedule of any payment due under the Plan is prohibited except as expressly provided in regulations and administrative guidance promulgated under Section 409A of the Code (such as accelerations for domestic relations orders and employment taxes). It is not an acceleration of the time or schedule of payment if the Employer waives or accelerates the vesting requirements applicable to a benefit under the Plan. 
 7.7 Residual Distributions. If calculation of the amount of any credit to a Participant s Deferred Compensation Account is not administratively practicable due to events beyond the 
 18 

control of the Employer, payments may be made to the Participant for residual amounts contributed to or remaining in a Deferred Compensation Account after payments under the provisions of this Section 7 have commenced or been completed. The residual amount shall be credited to the Deferred Compensation Account when the calculation of the amount becomes administratively practicable. Examples of residual amounts include, but are not limited to, additional investment returns credited after payment (due to dividends or pricing changes) or additional contributions made after payment (such as an annual bonus deferral or an Employer Credit). Payments that would have been made had the residual amount been calculable at the benefit commencement date shall be made up as soon as practicable after crediting to the Deferred Compensation Account, in no case later than the end of the year in which calculation of the amount becomes administratively practicable. 
 7.8 Ineffective Deferrals. If a Participant deferral election under Section 4 to contribute to an In-Service Account carries over to a subsequent year (an evergreen election) and the deferral election is ineffective (i.e., the distribution election would cause payment in the current or prior years), the amount deferred will be credited to a Deferred Compensation Account that is not an In-Service Account. If the Participant only has one account of this type, the amount deferred will be credited to that account. If the Participant has multiple accounts of this type, and one of the accounts has a lump sum at Separation from Service distribution election, the amount deferred will be credited to that account. If the Participant has multiple accounts of this type and does not have an account with a lump sum at Separation from Service distribution election, one will be established with a lump sum at Separation from Service distribution election and the amount deferred will be credited to this account. 

19 

Section 8. Accounts Deemed Investment Adjustments to Account 
 
 8.1 Accounts. The Committee shall establish a book reserve account, entitled the Deferred Compensation Account, on behalf of each Participant. The Committee shall also establish an In-Service Account as a part of the Deferred Compensation Account of each Participant, if applicable. The amount credited to the Deferred Compensation Account shall be adjusted pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.3. 
 8.2 Deemed Investments. The Deferred Compensation Account of a Participant shall be credited with an investment return determined as if the account were invested in one or more investment funds made available by the Committee. The Participant shall elect the investment funds in which the Participant s Deferred Compensation Account shall be deemed to be invested. Such election shall be made in the manner prescribed by the Committee and shall take effect upon the entry of the Participant into the Plan. The investment election of the Participant shall remain in effect until a new election is made by the Participant. In the event the Participant fails for any reason to make an effective election of the investment return to be credited to the account, the investment return shall be determined by the Committee. 
 8.3 Adjustments to Deferred Compensation Account. With respect to each Participant who has a Deferred Compensation Account under the Plan, the amount credited to such account shall be adjusted by the following debits and credits, at the times and in the order stated 
 8.3.1 The Deferred Compensation Account shall be debited each business day with the total amount of any payments made from such account since the last preceding business day. Unless otherwise specified by the Employer, each deemed investment fund will be debited pro-rata based on the value of the investment funds as of the end of the preceding business day. 
 
 8.3.2 The Deferred Compensation Account shall be credited on each Crediting Date with the total amount of any Participant Deferral Credits and Employer Credits to such account since the last preceding Crediting Date. 

20 

8.3.3 The Deferred Compensation Account shall be credited or debited on each day securities are traded on a national stock exchange with the amount of deemed investment gain or loss resulting from the performance of the deemed investment funds elected by the Participant in accordance with Section 8.2. The amount of such deemed investment gain or loss shall be determined by the Committee and such determination shall be final and conclusive upon all concerned. 

Section 9. Administration by Committee 
 
 9.1 Membership of Committee. If the Committee consists of individuals appointed by the Board, they will serve at the pleasure of the Board. Any member of the Committee may resign, and any successor shall be appointed by the Board. 
 9.2 General Administration. The Committee shall be responsible for the operation and administration of the Plan and for carrying out its provisions. The Committee shall have the full authority and discretion to make, amend, interpret, and enforce all appropriate rules and regulations for the administration of this Plan and decide or resolve any and all questions, including interpretations of this Plan, as may arise in connection with this Plan. Any such action taken by the Committee shall be final and conclusive on any party. To the extent the Committee has been granted discretionary authority under the Plan, the Committee s prior exercise of such authority shall not obligate it to exercise its authority in a like fashion thereafter. The Committee shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon all tables, valuations, certificates, opinions and reports furnished by any actuary, accountant, controller, counsel or other person employed or engaged by the Employer with respect to the Plan. The Committee may, from time to time, employ agents and delegate to such agents, including Employees of the Employer, such administrative or other duties as it sees fit. 
 9.3 Indemnification. To the extent not covered by insurance, the Employer shall 
 21 

indemnify the Committee, each Employee, officer, director, and agent of the Employer, and all persons formerly serving in such capacities, against any and all liabilities or expenses, including all legal fees relating thereto, arising in connection with the exercise of duties and responsibilities with respect to the Plan, provided however that the Employer shall not indemnify any person for liabilities or expenses due to that person s own gross negligence or willful misconduct. 
 
 Section 10. Contractual Liability, Trust 
 
 10.1 Contractual Liability. Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, the Company shall be obligated to make all payments hereunder. This obligation shall constitute a contractual liability of the Company to the Participants, and such payments shall be made from the general funds of the Company. The Company shall not be required to establish or maintain any special or separate fund, or otherwise to segregate assets to assure that such payments shall be made, and the Participants shall not have any interest in any particular assets of the Company by reason of its obligations hereunder. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payment from the Company under the Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured creditor of the Company. 
 10.2 Trust. The Employer may establish a trust to assist it in meeting its obligations under the Plan. Any such trust shall conform to the requirements of a grantor trust under Revenue Procedures 92-64 and 92-65 and at all times during the continuance of the trust the principal and income of the trust shall be subject to claims of general creditors of the Employer under federal and state law. The establishment of such a trust would not be intended to cause Participants to realize current income on amounts contributed thereto, and the trust would be so interpreted and administered. 
 
 22

 23 

such benefit be in any manner payable to any assignee, receiver or any one trustee. 

12.1 Plan-Approved Domestic Relations Orders. The Committee shall establish procedures for determining whether an order directed to the Plan is a Plan- Approved Domestic Relations Order.

 12.2 Payments to Minors and Others. If any individual entitled to receive a payment under the Plan shall be physically, mentally or legally incapable of receiving or acknowledging receipt of such payment, the Committee, upon the receipt of satisfactory evidence of incapacity and satisfactory evidence that another person or institution is maintaining custody of that person and that no guardian or committee has been appointed, may cause any payment otherwise payable to that person to be made to such person or institution so maintaining custody.

If a Beneficiary (the primary Beneficiary is receiving or is entitled to receive 
 
 24 

payments under the Plan and dies before receiving all of the payments due, the balance to which the Beneficiary is entitled shall be paid to the contingent Beneficiary, if any, named in the Participant's current Beneficiary designation form. If there is no contingent Beneficiary, the balance shall be paid to the estate of the primary Beneficiary. Any Beneficiary may disclaim all or any part of any benefit to which such Beneficiary shall be entitled hereunder by filing a written disclaimer with the Committee before payment of such benefit is to be made. Such a disclaimer shall be made in a form satisfactory to the Committee and shall be irrevocable when filed. Any benefit disclaimed shall be payable from the Plan in the same manner as if the Beneficiary who filed the disclaimer had predeceased the Participant. 
 
 Section 14. Amendment and Termination of Plan 
 
 The Employer may amend any provision of the Plan or terminate the Plan at any time provided, that in no event shall such amendment or termination reduce the balance in any Participant's Deferred Compensation Account, including reduction in vesting percentage, as of the date of such amendment or termination, nor shall any such amendment materially adversely affect the Participant relating to the payment of such Deferred Compensation Account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following special provisions shall apply 
 14.1 Termination and liquidation of the Plan in the Discretion of the Employer. The Employer in its discretion may terminate the Plan and distribute vested benefits in a single lump sum to Participants subject to the following requirements and any others specified under Section 409A of the Code 
 14.1.1 All arrangements sponsored by the Employer that would be aggregated with the Plan under Section 1.409A-l(c) of the Treasury Regulations are terminated.

5. PAYMENTS TO EXECUTIVE UPON AN EVENT OF TERMINATION. 
 
 (a) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Termination (as herein defined) during Executive s term of employment under this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 5 shall apply. As used in this Agreement, an Event of Termination shall mean and include any of the following

 (A) the failure to elect or reelect or to appoint or reappoint Executive as an Executive Vice President of the Bank (without Executive s consent)

Notwithstanding the preceding, in the event of a continuing breach of this Agreement by the Bank, Executive, after giving due notice within the prescribed time frame of an initial event specified above, shall not waive any of her rights under this Agreement and this Section solely by virtue of the fact that Executive has submitted her resignation, provided Executive has remained in the employment of the Bank and is engaged in good faith discussions to resolve any occurrence of an event described in clauses (A), (B), (C), (D) or (F) above. 
 
 (iii) Executive s resignation for Good Reason or Executive s involuntary termination of employment by the Bank on the effective date of, or at any time following, a Change in Control of the Bank or the Company during the term of this Agreement, provided that in the case of Executive s resignation for Good Reason, the Executive provides a Notice of Termination and follows the procedures set forth in Section 5(a)(ii) above.

Any payments hereunder shall be made in a lump sum within thirty (30) days after the Date of Termination, or in the event Executive is a Specified Employee (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations 1.409A-1(i)), and to the extent necessary to avoid penalties under Code Section 409A, no payment shall be made to Executive prior to the first day of the seventh month following Executive s Date of Termination. Such payments shall not be reduced in the event Executive obtains other employment following termination of employment. 
 
 (c) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Termination, the Bank will cause to be continued life insurance and non-taxable, medical and dental and disability coverage substantially identical to the coverage maintained by the Bank for Executive and her family prior to Executive s termination. Such coverage shall continue at the Bank s expense for a period of eighteen (18) months from the Date of Termination. If the Bank cannot provide one or more of the benefits set forth in this paragraph because Executive is no longer an employee, applicable rules and regulations prohibit such benefits or the payment of such benefits in the manner contemplated, would subject the Bank or Executive to penalties, then the Bank shall pay the Executive, to the extent possible under Code Section 409A, a cash lump sum payment reasonably estimated to be equal to the value of such benefits, with value to be determined by the policy premium paid for such coverage by the Bank, or for self insured benefits provided by the Bank, the fully equivalent rate(s) provided by the insurance provider(s), as applicable. Such cash lump sum payment shall be made within thirty (30) days after the Date of Termination, (or if later, the date on which it is determined that providing such benefits would subject the Bank or Executive to penalties, or in the event Executive is a Specified Employee (with the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(i)), and to the extent necessary to avoid penalties under Code Section 409A, no payment shall be made to Executive prior to the first day of the seventh month following Executive s Date of Termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if making a lump sum payment for any portion of such amount would violate Code Section 409A as an impermissible acceleration, then such portion would be paid to the Executive at the same time and in the same manner as the premiums for such benefit(s) would otherwise have been paid. 
 
 6 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the aggregate payments or benefits to be made or afforded to Executive under this Agreement, either as a stand-alone benefit or when aggregated with other payments to, or for the benefit of Executive, constitute an excess parachute payment under Code Section 280G, or any successor thereto, and in order to avoid such a result, Executive s benefits hereunder shall be reduced, if necessary, to an amount, the value of which is one dollar 1.00) less than an amount equal to three (3) times Executive s base amount, as determined in accordance with Code Section 280G. The allocation of the reduction required hereby shall be determined by Executive, provided, however, that if it is determined that such election by Executive shall be in violation of Code Section 409A, the allocation of the required reduction shall be pro-rata. 
 
 (e) This Agreement is intended to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A (including the exceptions thereto), to the extent applicable, and the Bank shall administer and interpret this Agreement in accordance with such requirements. If any provision contained in this Agreement conflicts with the requirements of Code Section 409A (or the exemptions intended to apply under this Agreement), this Agreement shall be deemed to be reformed to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A (or the applicable exemptions thereto). For purposes of Section 5, an Event of Termination as used herein shall mean Separation from Service as defined in Code Section 409A and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, provided, however, that the Bank and Executive reasonably anticipate that the level of bona fide services Executive would perform after termination would permanently decrease to a level that is less than 50 of the average level of bona fide services performed (whether as an employee or an independent contractor) over the immediately preceding 36-month period. 
 
 (f) Any payments or benefits payable as a result of an Event of Termination under Sections 5(a)(i) or 5(a)(ii) shall be contingent on Executive s execution and non-revocation of a release (the Release ), satisfactory to the Bank and the Company, of all claims that Executive or any of Executive s affiliates or beneficiaries may have against the Bank, the Company or any affiliate, and their officers, directors, successors and assigns, releasing said persons from any and all claims, rights, demands, causes of action, suits, arbitrations or grievances relating to Executive s employment relationship, including claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ADEA ), but not including claims for benefits under tax-qualified plans or other benefit plans in which Executive is vested, claims for benefits required by applicable law or claims with respect to obligations set forth in this Agreement that survive the termination of this Agreement. In order to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the ADEA, the Release must be provided to Executive no later than the date of her Separation from Service and Executive, the Company and the Bank must execute the Release within twenty-one 
 (21) days (or such longer period as may be required by applicable law) after the date of termination without subsequent revocation by Executive within seven (7) days after execution of the Release. 
 
 (g) Executive may voluntarily terminate her employment during the term of this Agreement (other than for Good Reason) upon at least ninety (90) days prior written notice to the Board of Directors of the Bank. In its discretion, the Board of Directors may accelerate Executive s termination date. Upon Executive s voluntary termination, she will receive only her compensation and vested rights and benefits to the date of her termination. Following her 
 
 7 

voluntary termination of employment under this Section 5(f), Executive will be subject to the requirements and restrictions set forth in Sections 11(a) and 11(c) of this Agreement. 
 
 6. TERMINATION FOR JUST CAUSE. 
 
 (a) The term Termination for Just Cause shall mean termination because of Executive s personal dishonesty, incompetence, willful misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty involving personal profit, material breach of the Bank s Code of Ethics, material violation of the Sarbanes-Oxley requirements for officers of public companies that in the reasonable opinion of the Board of Directors of the Bank will likely cause substantial financial harm or substantial injury to the reputation of the Bank, willfully engaging in actions that in the reasonable opinion of the Board of Directors of the Bank will likely cause substantial financial harm or substantial injury to the business reputation of the Bank, intentional failure to perform stated duties, willful violation of any law, rule or regulation (other than routine traffic violations or similar offenses) or final cease-and-desist order, or material breach of any provision of the contract. 
 
 (b) Notwithstanding Section 6(a), the Bank may not terminate Executive for Just Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to her a Notice of Termination by the Chief Executive Officer of the Bank, finding that in his good faith opinion, Executive was guilty of conduct justifying Termination for Just Cause. Executive shall not have the right to receive compensation or other benefits for any period after Termination for Just Cause. During the period beginning on the date of the Notice of Termination for Just Cause pursuant to this Section 6(b) through the Date of Termination, any unvested stock options and related limited rights granted to Executive under any stock option plan shall not be exercisable nor shall any unvested awards granted to Executive under any stock benefit plan of the Bank, the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof, vest. At the Date of Termination, any such unvested stock options and related limited rights and any such unvested awards shall become null and void and shall not be exercisable by or delivered to Executive at any time subsequent to such Termination for Just Cause. In the Event of Executive s Termination for Just Cause, Executive shall resign as a director of the Company and the Bank, and as a director and or officer of any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company and or the Bank.

In the event of such termination, Executive shall continue to receive her Base Salary, as defined in Section 3(a), at the rate in effect on the Date of Termination for period of one (1) year following the Date of Termination by reason of Disability. Such payments shall be reduced by the amount of any short- or long-term disability benefits payable to Executive under any disability program sponsored by the Company or the Bank, and if the disability insurance payments are excludable from Executive s income for federal income tax purposes, such amounts due Executive under this Section 7(b), shall be tax adjusted, assuming a combined federal, state and city tax rate of 38 , for purposes of determining the reduction in the payments due under this Agreement to reflect the tax-free nature of the disability insurance payment. By way of illustration, a 100 tax-free disability insurance payment shall reduce the payment due under this Agreement by 161.30. In addition, in the event of termination due to Executive s Disability, the Bank will continue to provide to Executive and her dependents for a period of one (1) year, the non-taxable medical, dental and other health benefits that were provided by the Bank to Executive and Executive s family prior to the occurrence of Executive s Disability, on the same terms (including cost to Executive) that were being provided to Executive immediately prior to the termination (except to the extent such benefits are changed in their application to all continuing employees of the Bank).

 (d) If the Bank cannot provide one or more of the non-taxable medical, dental or other health benefits set forth in Subsection (b) or (c) above because Executive is no longer an employee or in the event of the Executive s death, the benefits extend beyond the applicable COBRA period for the Executive s dependent(s), or applicable rules and regulations prohibit such benefits or the payment of such benefits in the manner contemplated would subject the Bank or Executive (or Executive s dependent(s), as applicable) to penalties, then the Bank shall pay the Executive (or her dependent(s)) a cash lump sum payment reasonably estimated to be equal to the value of such benefits with value to be determined by the policy premium paid for such coverage by the Bank, or for self insured benefits provided by the Bank, the fully equivalent rate(s) provided by the insurance provider(s), as applicable, within thirty (30) days after the date on which the Bank determines that it cannot provide such benefit directly. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if making a lump sum payment for any portion of such amount would violate Code Section 409A as an impermissible acceleration, then such portion would be paid to the Executive or her dependent(s) at the same time and in the same manner as the premiums for such benefit(s) would otherwise have been paid.
