Forward-Looking Statements 

Certain statements, other than purely historical
information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results,
and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements
generally are identified by the words believes, project, expects, anticipates, 
 estimates, intends, strategy, plan, may, will, would, 
 will be, will continue, will likely result, and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements
are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ
materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently
uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects include, but are not limited to:
changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted
accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance
should not be placed on such statements. 

Sale of Oil and Gas Equipment 

We are a start-up, oil and gas exploration stage
corporation and distributor of oil field equipment. We have not yet generated or realized any revenues from our business operations. We
do not own any interest in any oil and gas leases or properties. An exploration stage corporation is one engaged in the search
for oil and gas reserves which are not in either the development or production stage. 

We will begin limited operations by drop shipping
oil and gas equipment to purchasers. We will find and locate the desired equipment and require our customer to pay us the full purchase
price. We will then pay the manufacturer or wholesale therefore and cause the equipment to be delivered to our customer. 

Company s Office 

Our executive office is located at 1361 Peltier
Drive, Point Roberts, Washington 98281. Our telephone number is (604783-9664 and our registered agent for service of process
is the National Registered Agents Inc. of NV, located at 1000 East William Street, Suite 204, Carson City, Nevada 89701. Our fiscal year
end is April 30. 

Employees 

We are a start-up stage company and
currently have no employees other than our sole officer and director. We have no employment agreements with our sole officer and
director. Our officer and sole director has decided that he will only devote 10 of his time or four hours per week to
our operations and as a result our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to him. Since he
has no experience in oil and gas operations, he intends to hire at least one person who has experience in operating oil and gas
leases. The additional employee will not be hired until such time as we are ready to acquire an oil and gas lease. He will hire
an additional person until we raise additional capital to support the employment of such individual.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR OUR COMMON EQUITY, RELATED
STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES. 

There is no public trading market for our common
stock. There are no outstanding options or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into, our common stock. 

Dividends 

We have not declared any cash dividends, nor do
we intend to do so. We are not subject to any legal restrictions respecting the payment of dividends, except that they may not be paid
to render us insolvent. Dividend policy will be based on our cash resources and needs, and it is anticipated that all available cash will
be needed for our operations in the foreseeable future. 

Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 

Our shares are covered by section 15(g) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended that imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell such securities
to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally institutions with assets in excess of 5,000,000 or individuals
with net worth in excess of 1,000,000 or annual income exceeding 200,000 or 300,000 jointly with their spouses). For transactions covered
by the Rule, the broker/dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase and have received the purchaser s
written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, the Rule may affect the ability of broker/dealers to sell our securities
and also may affect your ability to sell your shares in the secondary market. 

Section 15(g) also imposes additional sales practice
requirements on broker/dealers who sell penny securities. These rules require a one-page summary of certain essential items. The items
include the risk of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary marketing; terms important to in understanding of
the function of the penny stock market, such as ID and offer quotes, a dealers spread and broker/dealer compensation; the broker/dealer
compensation, the broker/dealers duties to its customers, including the disclosures required by any other penny stock disclosure
rules; the customers rights and remedies in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions; and, FINRA s toll free telephone
number and the central number of the North American Administrators Association, for information on the disciplinary history of broker/dealers
and their associated persons. 

Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans

We have no equity compensation plans and accordingly
we have no shares authorized for issuance under an equity compensation plan. 

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities 

None 

Issuer Purchase of Securities 

The Company did not repurchase any of its securities
during the fiscal years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021.

ITEM 6. [Reserved]. 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this item. 

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION. 

Plan of Operation 

We are a start-up, oil and gas exploration
stage corporation and distributor of oil field equipment. We have not yet generated or realized any revenues from our business
operations. We do not own any interest in any oil and gas leases or properties. An exploration stage corporation is one
engaged in the search for oil and gas reserves which are not in either the development or production stage. 

We will begin limited operations by drop shipping
oil and gas equipment to purchasers. We will find and locate the desired equipment and require our customer to pay us the full purchase
price. We will then pay the manufacturer or wholesale therefore and cause the equipment to be delivered to our customer. 

At the same time, we intend to raise capital via
a private placement. The proceeds from the private placement will be used to acquire an oil and gas lease, upon which
we intend to drill one oil and/or gas well. 

Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion.
This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional
capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated any revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we begin drop shipping
oil and gas related equipment. Accordingly, we must raise cash from outside sources. 

We will be conducting research in the form of
drilling on the property. Our exploration program is explained in as much detail as possible in the business section of this prospectus.
We are not going to buy or sell any plant or significant equipment during the next twelve months other than casing, pipe, a pump jack,
and tanks. Casing and pipe will be purchased with funds we receive from the sale of oil and gas related equipment. A pump jack
and tanks will be purchased only if we strike oil. A pump jack and tanks are unnecessary if we find gas. 

We do not intend to interest other companies in
the property if we find oil and/or gas. We intend to develop the property our self. 

If we are unable to complete drilling one well
on the property, we will suspend operations until we raise more money. If we can t or don t raise more money, we will cease
operations. If we cease operations, we don t know what we will do, and we don t have any plans to do anything. 

We do not intend to hire additional employees
at this time. All of the work on the property will be conduct by unaffiliated independent contractors that we will hire. The independent
contractors will be responsible for drilling one well. 

In the event we complete our exploration program
prior to the end of one year, and it is anticipated we will do so as reflected in the milestones that follow, if we find oil and/or gas,
we will spend the balance of the year creating a program for development of the property. If we do not find oil and/or gas on the property,
we attempt to locate a new property, raise additional money, and explore the new property.

Results of Operations 

We have not yet recognized
any revenue as of April 30, 2022. 

For the year ended April
30, 2022 our net loss was 14,907 compared to 1,153 for the year ended April 30, 2020. During the current fiscal year we incurred 14,907
of general and administrative expenses. Our expenses in the prior year was 23,569 of general and administrative expenses and 22,506
gain on settlement of debt. 

Liquidity and Capital
Resources 

As of April 30, 2022,
we have no available cash, liabilities of 133,549 and an accumulated deficit of 134,759 During the year ended April 30, 2022 we used
 7,181 of cash for operating activities. For the year ended April 30, 2021, we used 21,829 of cash for operating activities. 

During the year ended
April 30, 2022, we received 7,181 from financing activities compared to 21,829 in the prior year. 

Our sole officer and
director is willing to advance funds to us on an as needed basis until such time as we can sustain our operations without his assistance.
 At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash, other than through as described herein. If we need
additional cash and can t raise it, or Mr. Nagy will not advance the same, we will either have to suspend operations until we do
raise the cash or cease operations entirely. Other than as described in this paragraph, we have no other financing plans.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders 
Black Rock Petroleum Company 

 Opinion on the Financial Statements 

 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of Black Rock Petroleum Company (the Company) as of April 30, 2021 and 2022 and the related statements of operations, stockholders 
deficit and cash flows for the years then ended and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion,
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2022 and 2021,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the period then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 

 Basis for Opinion 

 These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

 Our audit included performing procedures to
assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion 

Going Concern Uncertainty 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has
incurred losses since inception of 135,159. For the year ended April 30, 2022, the Company had a net loss of 15,307. These factors
create an uncertainty as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters
are also described in note 5. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Emphasis of Matters-Risks and Uncertainties 

The Company is not able to predict the ultimate impact
that COVID -19 will have on its business. However, if the current economic conditions continue, the pandemic could have an adverse impact
on the economies and 
financial markets of many countries, including the geographical area in which the Company plans to operate.

BLACK ROCK PETROLEUM COMPANY 

 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 APRIL 30. 2022 

NOTE 1 ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

Black Rock Petroleum Company, Black Rock 
or The Company located at 1361 Peltier Drive, Point Roberts WA, 98281, was formed on April 24, 2013 under the laws of the
State of Nevada. We have not commenced our planned operations. The Company s fiscal year end is April 30. 

On March 15, 2021, the Company believed it had completed a transaction
whereby it acquired One Hundred percent (100 of the ownership interests of Torrance Petroleum LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company,
in exchange for transfer of Sixty Million Four Hundred Twenty-five Thousand (60,425,000) restricted shares of Company common stock, 0.00001
par value, (the BKRP Common Shares owned by Zoltan Nagy, President/CEO of the Company, to the Seller, Affluence Projects
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. The original agreement provided that, in addition to transfer of the BKRP Common Shares to
Seller, the Company would issue to Seller shares of a new class of preferred stock, i.e., Fifty Million (50,000,000) shares of Series
A Preferred Stock. The amended agreement eliminated the shares of Series A Preferred Stock being issued to the Seller. As a result, no
additional shares of Company stock were issued by the Company pursuant to the transaction, as the BKRP Shares being transferred to the
Seller had been owned by Mr. Nagy and, thus, were already counted in the number of common shares issued and outstanding prior to the closing
of the transaction. 

Torrance Petroleum LLC has not fulfilled its obligations to complete
the transaction despite all assurances. Black Rock Petroleum Company therefore unilaterally rescinds the agreement as integral conditions
have not been met. The Company agrees to return the mineral rights of the 520 acre oil field in Torrance California back to the seller
in exchange for the return of 60,425,000 shares to Zoltan Nagy President of Black Rock Petroleum Company . 

We have not generated any operating revenues to date. 

NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis of Presentation 

The Company s financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

F- 7 

Fair value of financial instruments 

The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of
the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of
the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Paragraph 820-10-35-37 to measure the fair value of its financial instruments.
Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair
value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority
to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The
three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below: 

Level 1: Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. 

Level 2: Pricing inputs other than quoted prices
in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. 

Level 3: Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and
not corroborated by market data. 

The carrying amount of the Company s financial
assets and liabilities, such as cash and accounts payable approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.
 The Company s notes payable approximates the fair value of such instruments based upon management s best estimate of
interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar financial arrangements at April 30, 2022. 

Income Taxes 

The Company follow ASC 740-10-30, which requires
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial
statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement
and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to
reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the
assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Income in the period that includes the enactment date. 

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
(TCJA) was signed into law by the President of the United States. TCJA is a tax reform act that among other things, reduced corporate
tax rates to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018. FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be adjusted
for the effect of a change in tax laws or rates in the year of enactment, which is the year in which the change was signed into law. Accordingly,
the Company adjusted its deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31,2017, using the new corporate tax rate of 21 percent. See
Note 5. 

The Company adopted ASC 740-10-25 ASC
740-10-25 with regard to uncertainty income taxes. ASC 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed
or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under ASC 740-10-25, we may recognize
the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination
by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements
from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. ASC 740-10-25 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, and accounting
in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. We had no material adjustments to our liabilities for unrecognized income
tax benefits according to the provisions of ASC 740-10-25. 

F- 8 

Net income (loss) per common share 

Net income (loss) per common share is computed
pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed
by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net
income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and
potentially outstanding shares of common stock during the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially
outstanding common shares assumes that the Company incorporated as of the beginning of the first period presented. There were no potentially
dilutive shares for the years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021. 

Recently issued accounting pronouncements 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
 Leases (Topic 842) . ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and
requires expanded disclosures about leasing arrangements. The new standard supersedes the present U.S. GAAP standard on leases and
requires substantially all leases to be reported on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets and lease obligations. ASU 2016-02 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early
adoption permitted. There has been no material impact on our financial statements as a result of adopting this standard. 

On June 20, 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-07, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements
to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting . ASU 2018-07 is intended to reduce cost and complexity and to improve financial reporting
for share-based payments to nonemployees (for example, service providers, external legal counsel, suppliers, etc.). Under the new standard,
companies will no longer be required to value non-employee awards differently from employee awards. Meaning that companies will value
all equity classified awards at their grant-date under ASC718 and forgo revaluing the award after this date. The Company has chosen to
early adopt this standard. There has been no material impact on our financial statements as a result of adopting this standard. 

The Company has implemented all new accounting
pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise
disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have
a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 

NOTE 3 GOING CONCERN 

As reflected in the accompanying financial statements,
the Company has an accumulated deficit of 134,749 as at April 30, 2022, has no current operations and has generated no income to date.
These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the Company will continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability
and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be
unable to continue as a going concern. The Company is currently seeking an acquisition opportunity with a company in the mining sector. 

NOTE 4 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

Since the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, Zoltan
Nagy, CEO and Director, has advanced the Company funds to pay for general operating expenses. As of April 30, 2022 and April 30, 2021,
 84,613 and 77,432, respectively, is due to Mr. Nagy. The amount due is unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand. 

NOTE 5 LOAN PAYABLE 

During the year ended April 30, 2021, Walter Weeks
advanced the Company 32,125. The loan is unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand. 

NOTE 6 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

Management
has evaluated subsequent events pursuant to the requirements of ASC Topic 855, from the balance sheet date through the date the financial
statement were available to be issued and has determined that there are no material subsequent events that require disclosure in these
financial statements outside of those identified below. 

During July 2022, the company issued 39,150,000
shares of common stock for 391.50 and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock for 500, respectively.

I TEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS
WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

There have been no disagreements on accounting
and financial disclosures from the inception of our company through the date of this Form 10-K. 

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this
report. The disclosure controls and procedures ensure that all information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act is: (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rule and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of April 30, 2020, these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 

Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

Our management is responsible to establish and
maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible to
design or supervise a process that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The policies and procedures
include: 

maintenance of records in reasonable
detail to accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets, 

reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors, and 

reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial
statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 

Our management, with the participation of our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
the end of the period April 30, 2021. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based
on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the fiscal year April 30,
2021, our internal control over financial reporting were not effective at that reasonable assurance level. The following aspects of the
Company were noted as potential material weaknesses: 

lack of an audit committee 

lack of segregation of duties 

Changes in Internal Controls 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the year ended April 30, 2021 that have affected, or are reasonably likely to affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

Since April 24, 2013, our inception, Zoltan Nagy
has been our president, secretary, treasurer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and sole member of our board of
directors. Since March 24, 2011, Mr. Nagy has been president, secretary, treasurer, principal financial officer, principal accounting

Mr. Nagy was president, chief executive officer, treasurer, secretary and a director of Raptor Technology Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation
whose common stock is traded on the Bulletin Board under the symbol RAPT. Raptor Technology Group, Inc. is engaged in the business
of fabrication of equipment. On October 10, 2014, Raptor s Exchange Act registration was revoked by the SEC. The foregoing
positions constituted Mr. Nagy s principal occupations and employment during the past five years. 

None of our officer nor directors, promoters or
control persons have been involved in the past ten years in any of the following: 

(1) 
 
 Any bankruptcy petition filed by or against
any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years
prior to that time; 

(2) 
 
 Any conviction in a criminal proceeding or
being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); 

(3) 
 
 Being subject to any order, judgment or decree,
not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, or any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring,
suspending or otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities; or 

(4) 
 Being found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated. 

Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act 

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 requires our directors, executive officers and persons who own more than ten percent of our common stock, to file with the SEC initial
reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of common stock. Officers, directors and ten-percent or greater beneficial
owners are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. Based upon a review of
those forms and representations regarding the need for filing for the year ended April 30, 2021, we believe all necessary forms have been
filed. 

6 

Audit Committee Financial Expert 

We do not have an audit committee financial expert.
 We do not have an audit committee financial expert because we believe the cost related to retaining a financial expert at this time
is prohibitive. Further, because we have no operations, at the present time, we believe the services of a financial expert are not
warranted. 

Audit Committee and Charter 

Due to our size and scope of operations, we currently do not have an
independent audit committee in place.

We have adopted a corporate code of ethics. We
believe our code of ethics is reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and promote honest and ethical conduct; provide full, fair, accurate,
timely and understandable disclosure in public reports; comply with applicable laws; ensure prompt internal reporting of code violations;
and provide accountability for adherence to the code. A copy of the code of ethics is filed as Exhibit 14.1 with our Form 10-K/A-1 filed

Indemnification 

Under our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws
of the corporation, we may indemnify an officer or director who is made a party to any proceeding, including a lawsuit, because of his
position, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in our best interest. We may advance expenses incurred
in defending a proceeding. To the extent that the officer or director is successful on the merits in a proceeding as to which he is to
be indemnified, we must indemnify him against all expenses incurred, including attorney s fees. With respect to a derivative action,
indemnity may be made only for expenses actually and reasonably incurred in defending the proceeding, and if the officer or director is
judged liable, only by a court order. The indemnification is intended to be to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of
Nevada. 

Regarding indemnification for liabilities arising
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which may be permitted to directors or officers under Nevada law, we are informed that,
in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, indemnification is against public policy, as expressed in the Act and is, therefore,
unenforceable.
