 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Annual Report") contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report are based primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects and relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as may, will, should, might, expects, plans, anticipates, could, intends, target, projects, contemplates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential, or continue, or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans, or intentions. We cannot assure you that the results, events, and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur, and actual results, events, or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures, or investments we may make. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors described in the section titled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report. As such, you should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements made regarding changes in the competitive environment, responding to customer needs, research and product development plans, future products and services, growth in the size of our business and number of customers, strategic plans and objectives, business forecasts and plans, our future or assumed financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, trends affecting our business and industry, capital needs and financing plans, capital resource allocation plans, share repurchase plans, and commitments and contingencies, including with respect to the outcome of legal proceedings or regulatory matters. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this Annual Report is based only on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Annual Report or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. 
 
 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 Unless otherwise stated in this Annual Report, references to "AppFolio," "we," "us," and "our" refer to AppFolio, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 Overview 
 Founded in 2006, AppFolio is a leading provider of cloud business management solutions for the real estate industry. Our solutions are designed to enable our property manager customers to digitally transform their businesses, address critical business operations and deliver a better customer experience. Digital transformation is effectively a requirement for business success in the modern world, and the way we work and live today requires powerful software solutions. 
 AppFolio solutions are designed to meet that need in the real estate industry. We help our customers navigate an increasingly interconnected and growing network of stakeholders in their business ecosystems, including property owners, real estate investment managers, rental prospects, residents, and service providers, and provide key functionality related to critical transactions across the real estate lifecycle, including screening potential tenants, sending and receiving payments and even providing insurance-related risk mitigation services. AppFolio s intuitive interface, coupled with streamlined and automated workflows, makes it easier for our customers to eliminate redundant and manual processes so they can deliver a great experience for their network of stakeholders while improving financial and operational performance. 
 Our platform and mobile-optimized solutions are designed for use across multiple devices and operating systems, and to be (a) a system of record to centralize and automate essential business processes, (b) a system of engagement to enhance business interactions between our customers and their network of stakeholders, and (c) a system of intelligence to leverage data to predict and optimize business workflows in order to enable exceptional customer experiences and increase efficiency across their businesses. Our solutions are offered as a service, and are hosted using a modern cloud-based architecture. 
 We rely on strategic partners and third-party service providers to deliver certain aspects of our solutions, and strive to provide a seamlessly integrated experience for our customers and their stakeholders. We believe our customer-centric culture drives a focus on customer satisfaction that leads to long-term retention and, ultimately, to our long-term success. 
 1 

Our Core Solutions 
 Our Platform 
 AppFolio s platform addresses important aspects of workflows common to property management and is frequently updated in response to market trends and customer needs. Further, we believe that partnering and integrating with curated third party solutions to enable important functionality for our customers and their stakeholders while maintaining an elevated customer experience will benefit our customer base over time. Core functionality of our services addresses key operational issues, including accounting, business analytics and management, marketing and leasing functionality, maintenance and operational efficiency, as well as communications with key stakeholders in our customers' business ecosystems. 
 
 AppFolio Property Manager 
 AppFolio Property Manager provides the platform upon which property managers can run their business operations. Property management companies choose AppFolio Property Manager to leverage the benefits of process automation, an easy-to-use interface, and the optimization of common workflows. Customers include third-party property managers and owner-operators, who typically manage single- and multi-family residential properties, including single family homes, multi-family apartments, mobile homes, affordable housing, student housing, senior housing, and others who manage community association and commercial properties. 
 AppFolio Property Manager serves as our customers system of record with accounting functionality at the core. All critical transactions are completed and recorded in the system and give our customers access to the data they need to run their business. AppFolio Property Manager is also the system of engagement that customers use to interact with key stakeholders in their business ecosystems, including residents living at their properties, owners and investors owning those properties, and vendors providing products and services to the properties. Both aspects of the system are inherently interconnected so that the day-to-day interactions, such as residents paying rent through the AppFolio Property Manager mobile app, are instantly reflected in the system of record. AppFolio Property Manager's mobile capabilities enable our customers' teams to be productive regardless of their location, responding to leasing inquiries, addressing work orders, or completing inspections on the go. Due to their distributed nature, this is especially relevant for our property management customers with a significant portion of single-family or small multi-family properties. 
 2 

AppFolio Property Manager Plus 
 We continue to serve customers with larger and more complex portfolios with AppFolio Property Manager Plus, recognizing the evolving needs these customers have for deeper business insights, automation, and more advanced experiences. These customers typically have a more diverse mix of property types, a wider geographical dispersion of their properties, and the larger teams necessary to manage those types of portfolios. AppFolio Property Manager Plus is designed to solve these challenges in multiple ways: customizable workflows allow customers to digitize their existing processes; performance insights help drive efficiency; intelligent revenue management helps maximize real estate asset potential; integrations with a growing list of technology partners open new and diverse technologies and experiences; dedicated strategic account managers help customers realize the full benefit of our platform and solutions. 
 Value Added Services 
 AppFolio Property Manager s optional but often mission-critical Value Added Services are designed to enhance, automate and streamline business-critical processes and workflows. These services build on functionality and workflows in our core solutions and generally fall into the categories of marketing and leasing, electronic payment services, business optimization, and risk mitigation (e.g., insurance-related services). We strive for a seamless experience for our customers that increases their efficiency while not sacrificing ease of use of AppFolio Property Manager and AppFolio Property Manager Plus, whether services are offered by AppFolio or by a third-party partner. Utilization and adoption of our Value Added Services is typically higher for residential properties than community association or commercial properties because of the unique and complex needs of the residential rental lifecycle. 
 We empower our customers and their network of stakeholders with a wide variety of Value Added Services, primarily: 
 Payments. Our electronic payment services allow property managers to streamline their receivables and payables through a variety of online payment options. Customers can collect funds through our secure online portal, our mobile application and/or via electronic cash payments from various stakeholders, including applicants, residents and property owners. Types of funds that may be collected include rental application fees, security deposits, rent payments, and other tenant charges; contributions from property owners; and periodic dues from those living in community associations. Customers can also electronically send funds to various stakeholders, including distributions to property owners, payments to service providers, and even payment to their own management company. 
 Screening. Our tenant screening services include background screening, credit checks, income verification, and a streamlined rental history verification process for use in connection with the rental application process. 
 Insurance. Through our FolioGuard brand, we offer risk mitigation products for residents and property managers. FolioGuard Smart Ensure, our liability to landlord insurance product, allows property management customers to enforce insurance coverage requirements within their leases by tracking coverage of their units and adding uncovered units to a qualifying liability to landlord insurance policy via a licensed insurance broker. FolioGuard Renters Insurance protects the personal belongings of renters, as well as the property itself, from certain unexpected damages. 
 We experience some seasonality in our Value Added Services revenue. See Item 7, " Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations " for additional details regarding seasonality of revenue. 
 Our Growth Strategy 
 Our growth strategy is to provide increasingly valuable business management solutions to new and existing customers in the real estate industry. We are leveraging our growing footprint to expand within the property management market. Key components of our near and extended term growth strategy include: 
 Keep Our Existing Customers Happy. We believe customer success is essential to our long-term success, and we strive to have loyal and engaged long-term customer relationships. We place significant emphasis on customer experience to differentiate our solutions from competing products. This emphasis will continue to be a critical component of our growth strategy in the future. We believe that maintaining our focus on customer success will lead to new product innovation, the referral of new customers from existing satisfied customers, and greater adoption and utilization of our solutions. 
 Acquire New Customers. We believe new customer acquisition is essential to our long-term success. We expect to continue to grow our base of customers, and thus the number of units managed on our platform, with continued investments in the development of increasingly valuable business management solutions across not only the existing property types we currently serve but new ones as well, innovative sales and marketing programs, including evolving real estate industry thought leadership and education, and the referral power of satisfied customers. To continue to attract larger customers, we may increase our utilization of partnerships and integrations with select third parties to deliver key functionality. 
 3 

Expand Adoption and Use by Existing Customers. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in our solutions that expand functionality and enhance or add new capabilities to meet the current and evolving needs of our customers. We intend to continue using our market validation techniques and close relationships with our customers as a key source of feedback to inform and direct our product strategy. We expect our satisfied customers will expand their adoption and usage of our Value Added Services to adapt our platform to their specific operational requirements. In addition, as our customers grow, we expect they will continue to use our solutions to manage their larger businesses. To facilitate the continued use of our solutions by larger customers, we may increase our utilization of partnerships and integrations with select third parties to deliver key functionality while maintaining an elevated customer experience. 
 Our Customers 
 We define customers as those paying for a subscription to our core solutions. As of December 31, 2022, we had 18,441 property management customers. No individual customer represented 10 or more of our total revenue for fiscal 2022. 
 Customer Service 
 We believe our success is tied to long-term customer relationships, not a one-time sale. Our team is structured to deliver ongoing service; this includes ongoing live and on-demand training, a library of resources, and personalized account management. We regularly measure our Net Promoter Score and solicit customer feedback in a variety of ways in an effort to continue to better serve our customers. Our solutions are designed to be easy to use and manage, and we offer training and support at no extra charge. 
 Onboarding consists of a dedicated team that works to ensure that customers are prepared to run their businesses on our platform. As a result of our assistance with data migration matters, we are able to provide valuable insights into data integrity and work with our customers to help resolve any issues in their underlying business processes. We also assist our customers with the configuration of our products for particular property types, as appropriate. We share insights on best practices for the markets we serve and dedicate resources to guide our customers through the adoption and utilization of our Value Added Services. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We leverage a modern and scalable marketing approach along with marketing automation technology to attract and engage prospects and build brand recognition as an industry leader. We participate in industry thought leadership and education, and we use a variety of inbound and outbound marketing techniques to promote AppFolio solutions. 
 Our business development team acts in partnership with our marketing and sales teams to reach potential customers, generate sales opportunities, and accelerate the time from evaluation to close. Our sales representatives assist prospective customers as they evaluate our products. Our interactive sales methodology allows our sales team to quickly build relationships, assess our customers business challenges, and demonstrate the benefits of our core functionality and, where applicable, Value Added Services. 
 Technology and Operations 
 Our products are powered by a highly scalable computing platform and are designed with a strong focus on data security and availability. We take great care to keep our application framework and the rest of our software stack current in order to mitigate known security vulnerabilities. Our computing platform and cloud infrastructure are primarily powered by Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) platform. In order to ensure that data is not lost and that customer requests can be satisfied, production assets are securely replicated and regularly backed up to multiple geographic regions. 
 We monitor our production infrastructure to ensure high performance and availability, and our architecture allows our operators significant flexibility in achieving these goals. In particular, we have fine-grained control over the specific server and region on which each customer's data resides, and can move such data between different geographic regions in order to avoid service disruption or to increase service performance. 
 All sensitive data in our systems, including passwords, Social Security numbers, and tax identification numbers, is encrypted during transmission, and before being written to disk. We regularly evaluate our product and infrastructure security, including through third-party penetration testing. In addition, our products allow our customers to define roles that provide different levels of access to users, allowing them to view and modify specific items depending on their role. Supervisors can distribute work to staff in a secure and controlled environment, while leadership retains visibility across the entire system. Some sensitive customer actions require secondary verification via two-factor authentication, and any customer can enable two-factor authentication for logging into their account. 
 4 

Research and Product Development 
 We rely heavily on input from our customers and prospective customers in developing products that meet their needs and in anticipating developments in their businesses. We perform research and market validation efforts to guide our product roadmap. We believe that it is easier for our customers to adjust to continuous updates to our platform, which incrementally change and improve their user experience than to adapt to infrequent, but more drastic, upgrades. 
 Competition 
 The overall market for business management solutions in the real estate and other industries is global, highly competitive, and continually evolving to respond to changes in technology, operational requirements, and ever-changing laws and regulations. We believe our competitors primarily fall into the following categories: 
 On-premise or cloud-based real estate business management service providers that serve companies of all sizes in our markets; and 
 On-premise or cloud-based horizontal business management service providers that offer broad solutions across multiple industries. 
 We also experience competition from numerous cloud-based solutions providers that focus almost exclusively on one or more point solutions in the real estate industry or in other industries. Continued consolidation among cloud-based solution providers could significantly increase competition. 
 Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and other resources, greater name recognition and larger sales and marketing budgets; therefore, we may not always compare favorably with respect to some or all of the foregoing factors. Further, the barrier to entry for competition in one or more areas we serve may be low, which could lead to competition from new entrants who solve similar problems in different ways. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our core solutions and Value Added Services. We may pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. 
 We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours. 
 Human Capital 
 
 We believe our people are at the heart of our success. Our employees dedication to and passion for creating and delivering transformative solutions provides us with a competitive advantage and creates long-lasting relationships with our customers. We believe our efforts in creating and maintaining strong connections with our customers, partners, and team members differentiates AppFolio as a great place to work. This has led to recognition that demonstrates our valued company culture and workplace: In 2022, Fortune recognized AppFolio as one of the Best Workplaces in Technology, and the Glassdoor Employees Choice Awards listed AppFolio as one of the Best Places to Work. 
 Our company culture, driven by the following six core values, fuels our dedication and passion: 
 Simpler Is Better 
 Great, Innovative Products Are Key To A Great Business 
 Great People Make A Great Company 
 Listening To Customers Is In Our DNA 
 Small, Focused Teams Keep Us Agile 
 We Do The Right Thing; It s Good For Business 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,785 employees. We routinely engage temporary employees and consultants. Approximately 3 of our workforce is represented by a union, the Communications Workers of America. While it is our firm belief that a direct relationship between employee and employer is best, we recognize the decision made by these employees. We consider our relationships with our employees and consultants to be strong. To maintain this strong relationship and attract new talent, our human capital management efforts focus on the following initiatives: 
 5 

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Diversity is core to our values and, we believe, necessary to drive innovation and collective growth. Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion starts at the leadership level and cascades to our talented employees. AppFolio s employee-led resource groups aim to create an environment where everyone is valued for their uniqueness, while also feeling part of the larger whole. We work hard to make sure our employees voices are heard, from our practice of small, focused teams to setting annual company initiatives together as an organization. 
 When we conducted a voluntary survey of our workforce in 2022, of those who elected to share, approximately 54 identified as men, 45 identified as women, and less than 1 identified as nonbinary. Additionally approximately 65 identified as White, 12 identified as Asian, 11 identified as Hispanic or Latino, 5 identified as Black or African American, less than 1 identified as American Indian or Alaska Native, less than 1 identified as Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and 6 identified as two or more races. 
 Our recruiting practices focus on attracting and hiring employees with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and approaches at all levels of the company. We have key partnerships with universities and professional organizations and provide ongoing education to our hiring teams that are focused on closing the diversity gap and growing our team. 
 Employee Development. We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain at the forefront of innovation and make us an employer of choice. Employees throughout our organization have access to tailored training and learning programs designed both for our entire employee base as well as for distinct employee audiences. Our annual engagement survey provides a platform for employees to provide anonymous feedback directly to their managers and our executives. 
 Societal Impact. We believe in making an impactful contribution to the causes and communities that are meaningful to our employees in the context of the real estate industry. We encourage employee volunteerism through our employee-led Give Back Committee and company-wide benefit of eight hours of paid volunteer time off annually. Our corporate philanthropy program AppFolio Gives Back supports housing affordability, an ongoing challenge in the real estate industry, through a combination of employee fundraising, team volunteering, and a corporate matching gift program. 
 Environmental Stewardship. We believe in a culture of environmental stewardship, and through our employee-led Green Team we strive to have a positive impact on our environment both in the workplace and at home by educating employees on environmental issues and encouraging action. 
 Compensation and Benefits. Our compensation and benefits programs support the wellness of our employees and their families so they feel they can live their best lives both at work and at home. Our competitive compensation packages may include base salary, commission or annual performance-based bonuses, and stock-based compensation. We also offer paid parental leave, paid sabbaticals, paid leave to care for family members, and access to fertility networks and discounts on fertility care. We review our programs periodically to ensure they remain competitive. 
 Health, Safety, and Wellness. We are committed to providing a safe workplace for our employees and assisting them in maintaining a healthy work-life balance. We regularly solicit feedback to assess the well-being and needs of our employees and offer resources focused on mental health and physical wellness. We have embraced Together@AppFolio, our hybrid work model, where many of our employees work out of one of our offices several days a week and others work remotely.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 You should consider carefully the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report, as well as in our other filings with the SEC, in evaluating our business and/or an investment in our Class A common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our Class A common stock may decline and you might lose all or part of your investment. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks that we currently do not know about or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. 
 Please be advised that certain of the risks and uncertainties described below contain forward-looking statements. See the section of this Annual Report entitled Forward-Looking Statements for additional information.

Risks Related to Growing Our Business 
 If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our costs and operating expenses may increase without corresponding increases in revenue, which would adversely affect our operating results. 
 We have experienced, and anticipate that we will continue to experience, significant growth in the size, complexity, and diversity of our business. This growth has placed, and we expect that it will continue to place, a significant strain on our administrative, operational, and financial resources. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to manage this growth effectively. For example, to grow our customer base and facilitate the continuous launch and refinement of our products and services we invest significantly in our sales, marketing, and product development organizations as well as software and systems to support the efficient operation of such organizations. There is no guarantee that these or similar expenditures to support our growth will be successful. If we are unable to manage our growth successfully and efficiently, it could result in increased costs and operating expenses without corresponding increases in revenue, which would adversely affect our operating results. 
 If we do not accurately predict and respond promptly to rapidly evolving technological developments and customer needs, the demand for our products and our business and operating results may be harmed. 
 Customer demands are constantly changing in response to new technology and other market factors. To compete effectively, we must identify and innovate in the right technologies, accurately predict our customers evolving needs, and continually improve our own technology platform. If we fail to execute against any of the foregoing, our business and operating results may be harmed. In addition, the widespread adoption of quickly evolving disruptive technology products may significantly impact the real estate industry, even if such products are not specifically designed to apply directly to the real estate industry. The adoption of such new technologies could significantly reduce the volume or demand of our customers, thereby reducing our revenue, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 We participate in an intensely competitive market and our business could be harmed if we do not compete effectively. 
 The market for cloud-based business management solutions has relatively low barriers to entry and is global, highly competitive and continually evolving in response to a number of factors, including changes in technology, operational requirements, and laws and regulations. We compete with both other real estate industry cloud-based solution providers and providers of broad cloud-based solutions across multiple industries. We also face competition from numerous cloud-based solution providers that focus almost exclusively on one or more point solutions. Our competitors include established vendors, as well as newer entrants in the market. Our established competitors may have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and significantly greater resources, which allows them to respond more quickly and effectively to new or changing opportunities or challenges, technologies, operational requirements and industry standards. Our competitors who are new entrants to the market, and generally smaller, may have more nimble operations due to having fewer products and less overhead and may be willing to take legal and operational risks, which allows them to launch products and meet customer demand more quickly and efficiently. Regardless of size, our current and potential competitors may develop, market and sell new technologies with comparable functionality to our solutions, which could cause us to lose customers, slow the rate of growth of new customers and/or cause us to decrease our prices to remain competitive, which could harm our business. 
 In addition, we have introduced and expect to continue to introduce variations to our pricing model that are intended to provide broader usage and better align the cost of our services to the value they provide our customers. Although we believe that these pricing changes will increase customer adoption and revenue, it is possible that they will not and may make our services less appealing, which could negatively impact our business, revenue, and operating results. 
 If we are unable to successfully expand sales of our solutions to new markets and new industries, our business and operating results may suffer. 
 Our growth strategy includes expanding sales of our solutions to new markets and, potentially, new industries. These new markets and industries, include larger customers within the real estate space, housing types outside of multi-family and single-family residential, and industries other than real estate. Acceptance of our current and future solutions in new markets and industries will depend on numerous factors, including our ability to provide more sophisticated functionality and features, the pricing of our solutions relative to competitive products, perceptions about the security, privacy and availability of our solutions relative to competitive products, and the time-to-market of updates and enhancements to our services and products. There is no guarantee we will be successful in achieving all or any of the foregoing. Additionally, sales to new markets and industries will involve risks that are not present, or are present to a lesser extent, in sales to the markets and industry we currently serve, and such risks may include new regulatory regimes, longer sale cycles, increased chance of litigation with customers, increased risk and impact of reputational harm, and increased competition. We may not be able to sufficiently mitigate such risks, which would impact our ability to successfully expand our business. If we are unable to successfully expand sales of our solutions to new markets and, potentially, industries, our revenue may increase at a slower rate than we expect and may even decline, which could adversely affect our operating results.

Our business depends substantially on existing customers renewing their subscriptions with us and expanding their use of our Value Added Services, and a decline in either could adversely affect our operating results. 
 For us to maintain or increase our revenue and improve our operating results, it is important that our existing customers continue to use our core solutions, as well as increase their adoption and utilization of our Value Added Services. Our customers may not renew their subscriptions with us, continue to broaden their adoption and utilization of our Value Added Services, or use our Value Added Services at all. If our existing customers do not renew their subscriptions and increase their adoption and utilization of our existing or newly developed Value Added Services, our revenue may increase at a slower rate than we expect and may decline, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. A reduction in the number of our existing customers, even if offset by an increase in new customers, could reduce our revenue and operating margins. 
 Our inability to effectively maintain and enhance our brands could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and negatively affect our business and operating results. 
 Maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to achieving widespread awareness and acceptance of our solutions as well as maintaining and expanding our customer base. We expect the importance of brand recognition will increase, as competition for our products and services increases. If we do not continue to build awareness of our brands, we will be at a competitive disadvantage compared to companies whose brands are, or become, more recognizable than ours. Maintaining and enhancing our brands requires us to make substantial investments, and these investments may not result in commensurate increases in our revenue. In addition, new and existing technologies, industry trends, and laws that restrict online advertising or affect our ability to customize and target advertising may require us to significantly increase our marketing costs to generate and capture demand and maintain our brand awareness, level of sales, and operating results. If we fail to successfully maintain and enhance our brands, or if we make investments that are not offset by increased revenue, our operating results could be adversely affected. 
 We manage our business to achieve long-term growth, which may not be consistent with the short-term expectations of some investors. 
 We make product decisions and pursue opportunities that are consistent with our strategic objective to achieve long-term growth. These decisions may not be consistent with the short-term expectations of some investors, and may cause significant fluctuations in our results of operation and our stock price from period to period. In addition, notwithstanding our intention to make strategic decisions that positively impact long-term value, the decisions we make may not produce the long-term benefits we expect, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.

Our acquisition of other companies or technologies may subject us to risks. 
 We have acquired, and may in the future acquire, other companies or technologies to complement or expand our products and solutions, optimize our technical capabilities, enhance our ability to compete, or otherwise offer growth or strategic opportunities. We have limited experience and success in acquiring other businesses and we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired assets, technologies, personnel and operations or achieve the anticipated synergies or other benefits from the acquired business due to the inherent risks associated with acquisitions. If an acquisition fails to meet our expectations in terms of its contribution to our overall business strategy or results of operation, or if the costs of acquiring or integrating the acquired business exceed our estimates, our business, results of operation, strategic objectives, and financial condition may suffer. 
 Risks Related to Attracting and Retaining Talent 
 We depend on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or hire additional qualified personnel or if we lose key members of our management team, we may not be able to achieve our strategic objectives and our business may be harmed. 
 Our success and future growth depend, in part, upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key employees. To execute our growth plan and achieve our strategic objectives, we must continue to attract and retain highly qualified and motivated personnel across our organization. In particular, to continue to enhance our products and solutions, add new and innovative core functionality and/or Value Added Services, as well as develop new products, it will be critical for us to increase the size of our research and product development organization, including hiring highly skilled software engineers. Further, for us to achieve broader market acceptance of our products and solutions, grow our customer base, and pursue new markets consistent with our strategic plan, we will need to continue to increase the size of our sales, marketing and customer service and support organizations. Competition for personnel is intense within our industry and there continues to be upward pressure on the compensation paid to these professionals. Identifying, recruiting, training and retaining qualified personnel is difficult and requires a significant investment of time and resources. 
 Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater name recognition and financial resources than we have. As a result, we may have greater difficulty hiring and retaining skilled personnel than our competitors. In addition, prospective and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines, we are unable to offer equity awards in competitive amounts, or if the price of our Class A common stock experiences significant volatility, this may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. If we are unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary to execute our growth plan, we may be unable to achieve our strategic objectives and our operating results may suffer. 
 Our corporate culture has contributed to our success and, if we cannot continue to foster this culture, we could lose the passion, creativity, teamwork, focus and innovation fostered by our culture. 
 We believe that our culture has been and will continue to be a key contributor to our success. If we do not continue to develop our corporate culture or maintain our core values as we grow and evolve, we may be unable to foster the passion, creativity, teamwork, focus and innovation we believe we need to support our growth. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our ability to recruit and retain personnel and to effectively focus on and pursue our strategic objectives. As we grow, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture. This difficulty may be exacerbated by our current commitment to remote work, which makes it more challenging for employees to interact and connect.

Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Data Privacy 
 Security vulnerabilities in our products or a breach of our security controls could result in the loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, or unauthorized access to customer or employee data, or other confidential or sensitive information, which could harm our customer and/or employee relationships, expose us to litigation or harm our reputation. 
 Our business involves the storage and transmission of a significant amount of confidential and sensitive information, including sensitive and proprietary data and personal information collected by or on behalf of our customers, the personal information of our employees, customers, and prospective customers and our proprietary financial, operational and strategic information. Like many other businesses, we have experienced, and are continually at risk of being subject to, cyber attacks and data security incidents. As our business grows, the number of individuals using our products, as well as the amount of information we collect and store, is increasing, and our brands are becoming more widely recognized, which makes us a greater target for malicious activity. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant expenses in connection with our efforts to keep our systems, products and networks protected and up to date. However, there can be no assurance that the security measures we employ will prevent malicious or unauthorized access to our systems or information. Furthermore, no security program can entirely eliminate the risk of human error, such as an employee or contractor s failure to follow one or more security protocols. Therefore, despite our significant efforts to keep our systems, products and networks protected and up to date, we may be unable to anticipate new modes for cyber attacks, detect security incidents or react to them in a timely manner, or implement adequate preventive measures, any of which may expose us to a risk of loss, litigation and potential liability. In addition, some of our third-party service providers and partners also collect and/or store our sensitive information and our customers data on our behalf, and these service providers and partners have been, and continue to be, subject to similar threats of cyber attacks and other malicious Internet-based activities. Our contracts with these third parties may not provide us with adequate remedies in the event of such an incident which could also expose us to risk of loss, litigation, and potential liability. 
 If our security measures, or the security measures of our third-party service providers or partners, are breached as a result of wrongdoing or malicious activity on the part of our employees, our partners employees, our customers employees, or any third party, or as a result of any human error or neglect, product defect or otherwise, and this results in the loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, or unauthorized access to customer data or other sensitive information, we could incur liability to our customers and to individuals or organizations whose information was being stored by us or our customers, as well as fines and actions from payment processing networks or by governmental bodies. If we experience a widespread security breach, our insurance coverage may not offset liabilities actually incurred and insurance may not continue to be available to us on reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, security breaches could result in reputational damage, adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and cause existing customers to reduce or discontinue the use of our products and solutions. Furthermore, the perception by our current or potential customers that our products could be vulnerable to exploitation or that our security measures are inadequate, even in the absence of a particular problem or threat, could reduce market acceptance of our products and solutions and cause us to lose customers. The legal and regulatory environment around data security and governance is evolving, and both regulators and consumers are increasingly taking action on data-related matters, which may contribute to increased reputational, economic and other harm in the event of a data security incident. 
 Privacy and data security laws and regulations could impose additional costs and reduce demand for our solutions. 
 We store and transmit personal information relating to our employees, customers, prospective customers, and other individuals, and our customers use our technology platform to store and transmit a significant amount of personal information relating to their customers, vendors, employees and other industry participants. Federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted, and are increasingly adopting, laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, processing, storage and disclosure of personal or identifying information obtained from customers and other individuals. For example, in the United States new comprehensive privacy laws have or will be enacted in 2023 in Colorado, Utah, Connecticut and Virginia, and updates to existing laws and regulations in California also became effective on January 1, 2023. These obligations have and will likely continue to increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. 
 
 10 

In addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups may propose various self-regulatory standards that may legally or contractually apply to our business. As new laws, regulations and industry standards take effect, and as we offer new services in new markets, market segments and, potentially, new industries, we will need to understand and comply with various new requirements, which may impede our plans for growth or result in significant additional costs. These laws, regulations and industry standards have had, and will likely continue to have, negative effects on our business, including by increasing our costs and operating expenses, and/or delaying or impeding our deployment of new or existing core functionality or Value Added Services. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and industry standards could result in negative publicity, subject us to fines or penalties, expose us to litigation, or result in demands that we modify or cease existing business practices. Furthermore, privacy and data security concerns may cause our customers clients, vendors, employees and other industry participants to resist providing the personal information necessary to allow our customers to use our applications effectively, which could reduce overall demand for our solutions. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect our business and operating results. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Industry 
 All of our revenues are presently generated by sales to customers in the real estate industry, and factors that adversely affect that industry, or our customers within it, could also adversely affect us. 
 We expect that our real estate industry customers will continue to account for a significant portion or all of our revenue for the foreseeable future. Demand for our solutions and services could be affected by factors that are unique to and adversely affect the real estate industry and our customers within it. If the industry itself declines, our customers may decide not to renew their subscriptions or they may cease using our Value Added Services to reduce costs to remain competitive. For example, higher interest rates may make it difficult or impossible for our customers to obtain financing or may increase their cost of capital, which could negatively impact the demand for our solutions and services, increase customer churn, and impact our operating results. Further, we could lose real estate customers as a result of acquisitions or consolidations, bankruptcies or other financial difficulties facing our real estate customers, new or enhanced legal or regulatory regimes that negatively impact the real estate industry, and conditions or trends specific to the real estate industry such as the economic factors that impact the rental market. 
 Our estimates of market opportunity are subject to significant uncertainty. 
 We determine the level of our investment in various aspects of the business, in part, based on our market opportunity estimates. Market opportunity estimates are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions, including our internal analysis and industry experience. Assessing markets for cloud-based business management solutions in the real estate industry is particularly difficult due to a number of factors, including limited available information and rapid evolution of the industry and markets therein. If we do not accurately estimate our opportunities, we may fail to realize a return on our investment in various aspects of our business, which could lead to a failure to gain market share and negatively impact our long-term growth prospects. 
 Risks Related to Our Products and Solutions 
 If we are unable to deliver effective customer service, it could harm our relationships with our existing customers and adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and our operating results. 
 Our business depends, in part, on our ability to satisfy our customers by providing onboarding services and ongoing customer service. Once our solutions are deployed, our customers depend on our customer service organization to resolve technical issues relating to their use of our solutions. Increased demand for our support services may increase our costs without corresponding revenue, which could adversely affect our operating results. Further, our sales process is highly dependent on the ease of use of our solutions, our reputation and positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality and responsive customer service, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality and responsive customer service, could harm our reputation, cause us to lose customers and adversely impact our ability to sell our solutions to prospective customers. 
 11 

Errors, defects or other disruptions in our products could harm our reputation, cause us to lose customers, and result in significant expenditures to correct the problem. 
 Our customers use our products to manage critical aspects of their businesses, and any errors, defects or other disruptions in the performance of our products, or the products of our third party partners upon which certain of our products are dependent, may result in loss of or damage to our customers data and disruption to our customers businesses, which could harm our reputation. Such product problems could be caused by a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, power or network outages, fire, flood or other natural disasters, human or software errors, viruses, security breaches, fraud or other malicious activity, spikes in customer usage or distributed denial of service attacks. In addition, we provide continuous updates to our products and these updates may contain undetected errors when first introduced. In the past, we have discovered errors, failures, vulnerabilities and bugs in our updates after they have been released, and similar problems may arise in the future. Real or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities or bugs in our products could result in negative publicity, reputational harm, loss of customers, delay in market acceptance of our products and solutions, loss of competitive position, withholding or delay of payment to us, claims by customers for losses sustained by them and potential litigation or regulatory action. In any such event, we may be required to expend additional resources to help correct the problem or we may choose to expend additional resources to take corrective action even where not required. The costs incurred in correcting any material errors, defects or other disruptions could be substantial. In addition, we may not carry insurance sufficient to offset any losses that may result from claims arising from errors, defects or other disruptions in our products. 
 We face risks in our electronic payment services business that could adversely affect our business and/or results of operation. 
 Our electronic payment services business facilitates the processing of inbound and outbound payments for our customers. These payments are settled through our sponsoring clearing bank, card payment processors and other third-party electronic payment services providers that we contract with from time to time. Our electronic payment services subject us to a number of risks, including liability for customer costs related to disputed transactions. Additionally, with respect to the processing of electronic payment transactions by our third-party electronic payment services providers, we are exposed to financial risks that could affect our operating results. Electronic payment transactions between our customers and another individual may be returned for various reasons such as insufficient funds or stop payment orders. If we or any of our electronic payment services providers are unable to collect such amounts from the customer s account, we bear the ultimate risk of loss for the transaction amount. 
 Our electronic payment services business also exposes us to risk in connection with theft, fraud and other malicious activity on the part of our employees, our partners employees, or third parties who improperly gain access to our systems or our customers systems. In the event of such activity, we may incur liability to compensate our customers, our customers' stakeholders, or payment partners for losses incurred. While we take reasonable measures to secure our systems and payments infrastructure, it is not possible to entirely eliminate the risk of intentional wrongdoing. In the past, third party bad actors have gained improper access to our systems and our customers systems and we experienced financial loss as a result. If third party bad actors again gain access to our systems or our customers systems, or our employees or partners employees misuse our payment systems for malicious purposes, we could experience significant financial loss that may affect our operating results. 
 Changes to payment card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices could harm our business. 
 We do not directly access the payment card networks, such as Visa and MasterCard, that enable our acceptance of credit cards and debit cards, including some types of prepaid cards. Accordingly, we must rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions and must pay fees for the services. From time to time, payment card networks have increased, and may increase in the future, the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction which accesses their networks. Our payment card processors may have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us as well as increase their own fees for processing. Any changes in interchange fees and assessments could increase our operating costs and reduce our operating income. In addition, federal regulators have required Visa and MasterCard to reduce interchange fees, or have opened investigations as to whether Visa s or MasterCard s interchange fees and practices violate antitrust law. Any material change in credit or debit card interchange rates, including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations, could have an adverse effect on our business. 
 We are required by our processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including special operating rules for payment service providers to merchants, and we have agreed to reimburse our processors for any fines they are assessed by payment card networks as a result of any rule violations by us or our merchants. The payment card networks set and interpret the card operating rules. From time to time, the networks have alleged that various aspects of our business model violate these operating rules. If such allegations are not resolved favorably, they may result in material fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices that may be costly. In addition, the payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. As a result, we could lose our ability to give consumers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments. If we are unable to accept payment cards or are meaningfully limited in our ability to do so, our business would be adversely affected. 
 12 

We face risks in our tenant screening services business that could adversely affect our business and/or operating results. 
 Our tenant screening services business is subject to a number of complex laws that are subject to varying interpretations, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the "FCRA"), the Fair Housing Act, and related regulations. The FCRA continues to be the subject of multiple class-based litigation proceedings, as well as numerous regulatory inquiries and enforcement actions. In addition, entities such as the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have the authority to promulgate rules and regulations that may impact our customers and our business and have made various public statements that tenant screening is an area of focus for such agencies. Although we attempt to structure our tenant screening services to comply with relevant laws and regulations, we have previously been accused of not complying with such laws and regulations and may be found to be in violation of them. In addition we have been and expect in the future to be subject to routine regulatory inquiries, enforcement actions, class-based litigation and/or indemnity demands. 
 As previously disclosed, in January 2021, we entered into a settlement agreement with the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") to resolve allegations that we failed to comply with certain sections of the FCRA. In connection with the settlement, we paid a fine and agreed to ongoing compliance and reporting obligations. Our failure to comply with these obligations could result in material additional penalties or other actions by the FTC or other agencies, including enjoining our ability to provide screening services. 
 Due to the large number of tenant screening transactions in which we participate, our potential liability in any enforcement action or a class action lawsuit could have a material impact on our business, especially given that certain applicable laws and regulations provide for fines or penalties on a per occurrence basis. The existence of any such enforcement action or class action lawsuit, whether meritorious or not, may adversely affect our ability to attract customers, result in the loss of existing customers, harm our reputation and cause us to incur defense costs or other expenses. 
 If our property management customers stop requiring insurance coverage for their units, if insurance premiums decline or if insureds experience greater than expected losses, our operating results could be harmed. 
 We generate a portion of our revenue by offering insurance-related services through wholly owned subsidiaries. If demand for rental housing declines, or if our property management customers believe that it may decline, these customers may stop requiring insurance coverage for their units to reduce the overall cost of renting and make their rental offerings more competitive. If our property management customers stop tracking and requiring insurance coverage for their units or elect to use other methods of tracking and acquiring insurance coverage, demand for our insurance-related products may drop and our revenues from our insurance related products could be adversely affected. 
 In the event we are found to be in violation of the legal requirements applicable to our products and services, our business and operating results may be adversely affected. 
 Many of our products and services are highly regulated or intended to be used in connection with other highly regulated activities. Some of the laws and regulations to which our products and services are subject include, without limitation: 
 the Fair Housing Act; 
 the FCRA; 
 Title VII of the Civil Rights Act; 
 the Telephone Consumer Protection Act; 
 the Americans with Disabilities Act; 
 the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act; and 
 the Federal Trade Commission Act; 
 State law equivalents of the foregoing, plus various state regulations related to insurance licensing and solicitation, utility billing practices and privacy also apply to certain of our products and services. In addition, the evolution and expansion of our products and services may subject us to additional risks and regulatory requirements. For example, as our electronic payments services business evolves, we may become directly subject to limitations, laws and regulations governing money transmission and anti-money laundering. 
 In addition, we periodically undergo examinations, audits and investigations related to our services, including those related to the affairs of insurance companies and agencies and electronic payment services providers. Such examining, auditing, and investigating authorities are generally vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals, to implement and interpret rules and regulations, levy fines and penalties, and bring enforcement actions. While we have implemented various programs, processes and controls focused on compliance with applicable laws and regulations throughout our business, there is no guarantee that we will not be subject to fines, penalties or other regulatory actions in one or more jurisdictions, or be required to adjust our business practices to accommodate future regulatory requirements. In the event that we are found to be in violation of our legal, regulatory or contractual requirements, we may be subject to monetary fines or penalties, cease-and-desist orders, mandatory product changes, or other liabilities that could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. 
 13 

If we fail to maintain relationships with third-party partners that enable certain functionality within our solutions, our business and operating results may be harmed. 
 Certain functionality of our services is provided, supported or enhanced by third parties, including without limitation functions related to customer relationship management, utility billing management, cloud computing, texting, emailing, electronic payments, tenant screening, and insurance related offerings. If our third-party partners cease providing their products, if such third parties are acquired by competitors or if we are otherwise unable to integrate with such third-party products, our solutions and demand for our solutions could be adversely impacted and our business and operating results would be harmed. In addition, our competitors may be more effective than us in cost-effectively building relationships with third parties that enhance their products and services, allow them to provide more competitive pricing, or offer other benefits to their customers. Acquisitions of our partners by our competitors or others could result in a decrease in the number of current and potential strategic partners willing to establish or maintain relationships with us, and could increase the price at which products or services are available to us. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our customer base and revenue could be impaired, which could negatively impact our operating results. 
 If we are unable to ensure that our solutions interoperate and keep pace with other technology, our solutions may become less competitive and our operating results may be harmed. 
 We depend on the interoperability of our platform with web browsers, and in the case of our mobile applications - operating systems, that we do not control. Any changes in such web browsers or systems that degrade the functionality of our solutions or give preferential treatment to competitive services could adversely affect the adoption and usage of our solutions. In addition, to deliver high quality solutions, we will need to continuously enhance and modify our functionality to keep pace with technical, contractual, and other changes in Internet-related hardware, mobile operating systems such as iOS and Android, browsers, communication, network and database technologies. We may not be successful in developing enhancements and modifications that operate effectively with these devices, operating systems, web browsers or other technologies or in bringing them to market in a timely manner. Furthermore, uncertainties regarding the timing or nature of new network platforms or technologies, and modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and product development expenses. In the event that it is difficult for our customers to access and use our solutions, our solutions may become less competitive, and our operating results could be adversely affected. 
 Risks Related to Intellectual Property Matters 
 Failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brands, which could harm our business. 
 We currently rely on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, trade secret protection, and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, we utilize third party platforms to host our code for version control and collaboration and rely on the security features made available by such platforms to prevent unauthorized access to our code. Our success and ability to compete depend, in part, on our ability to continue to protect our intellectual property, including our code, proprietary technology and brands. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights adequately or the security controls made available by our code hosting partners are compromised and our code is improperly accessed, which has previously occurred and could occur again in the future, our competitors could use the intellectual property we have developed to enhance their own products and services, which could harm our business. In addition, third parties may independently develop technologies or products that compete with ours, and we may be unable to prevent such competition. To monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to expend significant resources. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management, and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property or require us to pay costly royalties. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business and operating results. 
 14 

We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, which could cause us to incur significant expenses and require us to pay substantial damages. 
 Our success depends, in part, on us refraining from infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. Our competitors, as well as a number of other entities and individuals, may legally own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our technology or solutions, including without limitation technology we develop and build internally and/or acquire. From time to time, our competitors or other third parties may claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Any claims or litigation, regardless of merit, could cause us to incur significant expenses, distract management, and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages, settlement costs or ongoing royalty payments, require that we comply with other unfavorable license and other terms, or prevent us from offering our solutions in their current form. Even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and harm our operating results. 
 Our solutions contain both open source and third-party software, which may pose risks to our proprietary source code and/or introduce security vulnerabilities, and could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results. 
 We use open source software in our solutions and expect to continue to do so in the future. The terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by United States or foreign courts, and there is a risk that open source licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions, restrictions or costs on our ability to provide or distribute our solutions. Additionally, we may from time to time face claims from third parties alleging ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software or of derivative works that we developed using such software, which could include our proprietary source code, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation, which could be costly for us to defend, and could require us to make our source code freely available, purchase a costly license or cease offering the implicated functionality unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement. This re-engineering process could require significant additional research and product development resources, and we may not be able to complete it successfully or in a timely manner. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software. We also use third-party commercial software in our solutions and expect to continue to do so in the future. Third-party commercial software is developed outside of our direct control and may introduce security vulnerabilities that may be difficult to anticipate or mitigate. Further, there is no guarantee that third-party software developers or open source software providers will continue to maintain and update the third-party software that we use. Should development of in-use third-party software cease, significant engineering effort may be required to create an in-house solution. These risks could also be difficult to eliminate or manage, and could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results. 
 Risks Related to Our Financial Results 
 We expect to make substantial investments across our organization to grow our business, which may impact profitability. 
 To implement our business and growth strategy, we have made and will continue to make substantial investments across our organization and, as a result, our expenses may increase significantly impacting profitability. For example, we intend to continue to make substantial investments in, among other things: our research and product development organization to enhance the ease of use and functionality of our solutions and develop new products; our sales and marketing organization, including expansion of our direct sales organization and marketing programs, to increase the size of our customer base and increase adoption and utilization of new and existing Value Added Services by our new and existing customers; and maintaining and expanding our technology infrastructure and operational support to promote the security and availability of our products and solutions. Even if we are successful in growing our customer base and increasing revenue from new and existing customers, we may not be able to generate additional revenue in an amount that is sufficient to cover our expenses. 
 Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and period-to-period comparisons of our results may not be meaningful. 
 Our quarterly results, including the levels of our revenue, costs, operating expenses, and operating margins, may fluctuate significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons of our results may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance. We may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results from period to period, including significant losses. This may make it difficult for us to effectively allocate our resources to achieve our strategic goals. Furthermore, if our quarterly results fall below the expectations of investors or any securities analysts who follow our stock, or below any financial guidance we may provide, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. 
 15 

There are risks associated with potential future indebtedness that may adversely affect our financial condition and future financing agreements may contain restrictive operating and financial covenants. 
 We may incur indebtedness in the future and/or enter into new financing arrangements. Our ability to meet expenses, to remain in compliance with the covenants under any future debt instruments, and to pay fees, interest and principal on our indebtedness will depend on, among other things, our operating performance and market conditions. Accordingly, our cash flow may not be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on future indebtedness and meet our other business and customer obligations. 
 In addition, increases in interest rates have increased the cost of borrowing and volatility in financial markets could impact our access to, or further increase the cost of, any new financing arrangements we may enter into. Past disruptions in the credit and equity markets made it more difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms. These conditions tended to increase the cost of borrowing in the past and if they recur, our borrowing costs could increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments. We may not be able to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. 
 Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. 
 Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code"), if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, the corporation s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by 5 shareholders that exceeds 50 over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. It is possible that our existing net operating loss and/or credit carryforwards may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and future issuances of our stock could cause an ownership change. Furthermore, our ability to utilize net operating loss and/or credit carryforwards of companies that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. There is also a risk that due to legislative changes, such as suspensions on the use of net operating loss carryforwards, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing net operating loss carryforwards could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. 
 Risks Related to Our Common Stock 
 The market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, which could result in substantial losses for our stockholders. 
 The market price of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile, and fluctuations in the price of our Class A common stock could cause our stockholders to lose all or part of their investments. There are a wide variety of factors, many of which are outside our control, that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our Class A common stock, including without limitation: 
 changes in the estimates of our operating results; 
 changes in recommendations by securities analysts; 
 announcements of new products, services or technologies; 
 fluctuations in our valuation or the valuation of similarly situated companies; 
 changes to our management team; 
 trading activity by insiders or the market s perception that insiders intend to sell their shares; 
 the trading volume of our Class A common stock, including sales upon exercise of outstanding options or vesting of equity awards; and 
 the overall performance of the equity markets. 
 Such factors could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline or make it more difficult for you to sell your Class A common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate, and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. 
 16 

The dual class structure of our common stock concentrates voting control with a limited number of stockholders, including our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders, effectively limiting your ability to influence corporate matters. 
 Our Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of December 31, 2022, the holders of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock, including our executive officers, directors, and principal stockholders, collectively held approximately 88 of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Because of the 10-to-1 voting ratio between our Class B common stock and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore control the election of a majority of our directors and thereby have the power to control our affairs and policies, including the appointment of management and strategic decisions, as well as matters that are submitted to a vote by our holders of our common stock. The interests of our principal stockholders may be inconsistent with or adverse to those of holders of our Class A common stock. This concentrated control may also have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change-in-control transaction, depriving our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock or negatively affecting the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, transfers by holders of our Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions. The conversion of our Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of the holders of our Class B common stock who retain their shares over the long term. 
 We cannot predict the impact that our capital structure may have on our stock price. 
 S P Dow Jones, a provider of widely followed stock indices, has announced that companies with multiple classes of stock will not be eligible for inclusion in certain of their indices. As a result, our Class A common stock will not be eligible for those stock indices. Many investment funds are precluded from investing in companies that are not included in major indices, and these funds would be unable to purchase our Class A common stock. Exclusion from these and other indices could make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors and, as a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected. In addition, several shareholder advisory firms have announced their opposition to the use of multiple class structures. As a result, shareholder advisory firms may publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure. Any actions or publications by shareholder advisory firms critical of our corporate governance practices or capital structure could also adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock. 
 We do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future and may repurchase stock in accordance with our Share Repurchase Program. 
 We have never declared, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying, any cash dividends to holders of our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of our future borrowing arrangements we may enter into from time to time may restrict our ability to pay dividends. Consequently, investors may need to rely on sales of our Class A common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. 
 Price appreciation, which may never occur, may be further impacted by repurchases of our shares in accordance with our Share Repurchase Program. Repurchases of our shares could increase the volatility of the trading price of our shares, which could have a material adverse impact on the trading price of our shares. Similarly, the future announcement of the termination or suspension of the Share Repurchase Program, or our decision not to utilize the full authorized repurchase amount under the Share Repurchase Program, could result in a decrease in the trading price of our shares. In addition, the Share Repurchase Program could have the impact of diminishing our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance our growth, complete acquisitions and execute our strategic plan. For additional information regarding our Share Repurchase Program, refer to Note 11, Stockholders' Equity . 
 
 Anti-takeover provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult hostile takeovers, change-in-control transactions or changes in our Board of Directors or management. Among other things, these provisions authorize the issuance of preferred stock with powers, preferences and rights that may be senior to our common stock, provide for the adoption of a staggered three-class Board of Directors, prohibit our stockholders from filling vacancies on our Board of Directors or calling special stockholder meetings, require the vote of at least two-thirds of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock to approve amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, and require the approval of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock voting as a separate class prior to consummating a change-in-control transaction. As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may delay, deter or prevent a change-in-control transaction. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 or more of our common stock. Any provision of Delaware law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws that has the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, deterring or preventing a change-in-control transaction could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our capital stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock. 
 17 

We could be subject to securities class action litigation. 
 In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities. This type of litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Additionally, the dramatic increase in the cost of directors and officers liability insurance may make it more expensive for us to obtain directors and officers liability insurance in the future and may require us to opt for lower overall policy limits and coverage or to forgo insurance that we may otherwise rely on to cover significant defense costs, settlements, and damages awarded to plaintiffs, or incur substantially higher costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. These factors could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and members of our board of directors. 
 Risks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions 
 Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business. 
 Adverse global and regional economic conditions such as turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets, including, but not limited to, recessionary or inflationary pressures, tightening in the credit markets, extreme volatility or distress in the financial markets, supply chain issues, reduced consumer confidence or economic activity, government fiscal and tax policies, the ongoing impact of COVID-19, geopolitical events, and other negative financial news or macroeconomic developments could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services or cause us to experience increased costs that could negatively affect our operating results. 
 Government regulations and laws are continuously evolving and unfavorable changes could adversely affect our operating results, subject us to litigation or governmental investigation, or otherwise harm our business. 
 In addition to regulations and laws directly applicable to our products and services, we are subject to general business regulations and laws. Unfavorable regulations, laws, and administrative or judicial decisions interpreting or applying laws and regulations applicable to our business could subject us to litigation or governmental investigation and increase our cost of doing business, any of which may adversely affect our operating results. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 contains several revisions to the Internal Revenue Code, including a 15 corporate minimum income tax on adjusted financial statement income for companies with profits greater than 1.0 billion and a nondeductible 1 excise tax on corporate stock repurchases in tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. While the foregoing tax law changes have no immediate effect on our business, such changes or similar changes may adversely affect our operating results in the future. In addition, the application of federal, state, local and foreign tax laws to services provided electronically is continuously evolving. New income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted or amended at any time, possibly with retroactive effect, and could be applied solely or disproportionately to services provided over the Internet. These enactments or amendments could adversely affect our sales activity due to the inherent cost increase such taxes would represent and could ultimately result in a negative impact on our operating results. In addition, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, modified or applied adversely to us, possibly with retroactive effect, which could require us or our customers to pay additional tax amounts, as well as require us or our customers to pay fines or penalties, as well as interest on past amounts. If we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes due from our customers, we could be held liable for such costs, thereby adversely impacting our operating results. 
 Health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse impact on our operations, employees culture, customers, and business partners. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have, and a future public health crisis could have, repercussions across local, regional, and global economies and financial markets. Travel restrictions, quarantines, and similar government orders to control the spread of COVID-19 or a future virus may result in business closures, work stoppages, slowdowns, and cancellation or postponement of events that, among other effects, could negatively impact our operations, as well as the operations of our customers, and business partners. The demand for our products and services, as well as our operating results, could be adversely impacted due to customers delaying decisions to adopt our products and services or terminating their use of our products and services, as they seek to reduce or delay spending to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a future public health crisis on their businesses. 
 18 

Natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, commerce and the global economy, and have a negative effect on our business and operations. 
 Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, flooding, fire, power shortages, pandemics, terrorism, political unrest, telecommunications failure, vandalism, cyber-attacks, geopolitical instability, war, the effects of climate change (such as drought, wildfires, hurricanes, increased storm severity and sea level rise) and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, could decrease demand for our services, and could cause us to incur substantial expense. Our insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses or additional expenses that we may sustain. The majority of our research and development activities, offices, information technology systems, and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in California. Customer data could be lost, significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected in the event of a major natural disaster or catastrophic event. In addition, the impacts of climate change on the global economy and our industry are rapidly evolving. We may be subject to increased regulations, reporting requirements, standards or expectations regarding the environmental impacts of our business. 

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 
 
 None. 

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 
 Our corporate headquarters is located in Santa Barbara, California, where we lease approximately 86,000 square feet of space. We also lease office space in several other U.S. cities. We do not own any real estate. 
 We believe our current facilities are adequate for our current needs and that, should it be needed, suitable additional or alternative space will be available to us to accommodate any such expansion of our operations. 
 
 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 From time to time, we are involved in various investigative inquiries, legal proceedings and other disputes arising from or related to matters incident to the ordinary course of our business activities, including actions with respect to intellectual property, employment, labor, regulatory and contractual matters. Although the results of such investigative inquiries, legal proceedings and other disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that we are not currently a party to any matters which, if determined adversely to us, would, individually or taken together, have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. However, regardless of the merit of any matters raised or the ultimate outcome, investigative inquiries, legal proceedings and other disputes may generally have an adverse impact on us as a result of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.

 Overview 
 We are a leading provider of cloud business management solutions for the real estate industry. Our solutions are designed to enable our property manager customers to digitally transform their businesses, address critical business operations and deliver a better customer experience. Our products assist our customers with an interconnected and growing network of stakeholders in their business ecosystems, including property owners, real estate investment managers, rental prospects, residents, and service providers, and provide key functionality related to critical transactions across the real estate lifecycle, including screening potential tenants, sending and receiving payments and even providing insurance-related risk mitigation services. AppFolio s intuitive interface, coupled with streamlined and automated workflows, make it easier for our customers to eliminate redundant and manual processes so they can deliver a great experience for their network of stakeholders while improving financial and operational performance. 
 We rely heavily on our talented team of employees to execute our growth plans and achieve our long-term strategic objectives. We believe our people are at the heart of our success and our customers' success, and we have worked hard not only to attract and retain talented individuals, but also to provide a challenging and rewarding work environment to motivate and develop our valuable human capital. As we navigate the challenges of increased competition for talent, we continue to evolve our compensation and employee reward practices. 
 Key Business Metric 
 Property management units under management . We believe that our ability to increase our number of property management units under management is an indicator of our market penetration, growth, and potential future business opportunities. We define property management units under management as active or committed units under management at the period end date. We had 7.3 million and 6.3 million property management units under management as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Seasonality 
 We have historically experienced seasonality in our Value Added Services revenue, primarily in our tenant screening services, due to seasonally higher leasing activities in the second quarter which increases tenant screening transactions in that period. We generally experience decreased tenant screening revenue in the fourth quarter, when seasonally lower leasing activities occur. Corresponding to the higher tenant applications in the second quarter, our property manager customers typically experience an increase in new tenants in the third quarter, resulting in a higher demand for our insurance-related risk mitigation services in that period. As a result of the seasonality of the rental lifecycle and the growth of our business, we have typically experienced a sequential increase in revenue in the first, second and third quarters and a sequential decline in revenue in the fourth quarter of each of our most recent fiscal years. These seasonal factors could be heightened or lessened due to the impact of a change in macroeconomic factors that could impact tenant behavior or a change in the adoption rate of our other less seasonally impacted Value Added Services. Although these seasonal factors are common in the real estate industry, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance.

Key Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Our core solutions and certain of our Value Added Services are offered on a subscription basis. Our core solutions subscription fees vary by property type and are designed to scale with the size of our customers businesses. We recognize revenue for subscription-based services on a straight-line basis over the contract term beginning on the date that our service is made available. We generally invoice monthly or, to a lesser extent, annually in advance of the subscription period. 
 We also offer certain Value Added Services, which are not covered by our subscription fees, on a per-use basis. Usage-based fees are charged either as a percentage of the transaction amount (e.g., for certain of our payment services) or on a flat fee per transaction basis with no minimum usage commitments (e.g., for our tenant screening and risk mitigation services). We recognize revenue for usage-based services in the period the service is rendered. Our payments services fees are recorded gross of the interchange and payment processing related fees. We generally invoice our usage-based services on a monthly basis or collect the fee at the time of service. A significant majority of our Value Added Services revenue comes from the use of our payment services, tenant screening services, and risk mitigation services. 
 We charge our customers for onboarding assistance to our core solutions and certain other non-recurring services. We generally invoice for these other services in advance of the services being completed and recognize revenue in the period the service is rendered. We generate revenue from the legacy customers of previously acquired businesses by providing services outside of our property management core solution platform. Revenue derived from these services is recorded in Other revenue. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had 18,441 and 17,215 property management customers, respectively. 
 
 Costs and Operating Expenses 
 Cost of Revenue (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization). Many of our Value Added Services are facilitated by third-party service providers. Cost of revenue paid to these third-party service providers includes the cost of electronic interchange and payment processing-related services to support our payments services, the cost of credit reporting services for our tenant screening services, and various costs associated with our risk mitigation service providers. These third-party costs vary both in amount and as a percent of revenue for each Value Added Service offering. Cost of revenue also consists of personnel-related costs for our employees focused on customer service and the support of our operations (including salaries, performance-based compensation, benefits, and stock-based compensation), platform infrastructure costs (such as data center operations and hosting-related costs), and allocated shared and other costs. Cost of revenue excludes depreciation of property and equipment, amortization of capitalized software development costs and amortization of intangible assets. 
 Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists of personnel-related costs for our employees focused on sales and marketing (including salaries, sales commissions, performance-based compensation, benefits, and stock-based compensation), costs associated with sales and marketing activities, and allocated shared and other costs. Marketing activities include advertising, online lead generation, lead nurturing, customer and industry events, and the creation of industry-related content and collateral. We focus our sales and marketing efforts on generating awareness of our software solutions, creating sales leads, establishing and promoting our brands, and cultivating an educated community of successful and vocal customers. 
 Research and Product Development. Research and product development expense consists of personnel-related costs for our employees focused on research and product development (including salaries, performance-based compensation, benefits, and stock-based compensation), fees for third-party development resources, and allocated shared and other costs. Our research and product development efforts are focused on expanding functionality and the ease of use of our existing software solutions by adding new core functionality, Value Added Services and other improvements, as well as developing new products and services. We capitalize our software development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization. Amortization of capitalized software development costs is included in depreciation and amortization expense. 
 General and Administrative. General and administrative expense consists of personnel-related costs for employees in our executive, finance, information technology, human resources, legal, compliance, corporate development and administrative organizations (including salaries, performance-based cash compensation, benefits, and stock-based compensation). In addition, general and administrative expense includes fees for third-party professional services (including audit, legal, compliance, and tax services), transaction costs related to sales of subsidiary businesses, regulatory fees, other corporate expenses, impairment of long-lived assets, and allocated shared and other costs. 
 Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of property and equipment, amortization of capitalized software development costs, and amortization of intangible assets. We depreciate or amortize property and equipment, software development costs, and intangible assets over their expected useful lives on a straight-line basis, which approximates the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are consumed. 
 22 

Other Income, Net. Other income, net includes gain on sale of our equity-method investments, gains and losses associated with the sale of businesses and property and equipment, and income from certain post-closing transition services provided by us to MyCase, Inc. during fiscal year 2021. 
 Interest Income (Expense), Net. Interest income includes interest earned on investment securities, amortization and accretion of the premium and discounts paid from the purchase of investment securities, and interest earned on cash deposited in our bank accounts. Interest expense includes interest paid on any outstanding borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the United States. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Year Ended December 31, Change 2022 2021 Amount (dollars in thousands) Core solutions 132,541 105,148 27,393 26 Value Added Services 327,636 241,289 86,347 36 Other 11,706 12,933 (1,227) (9) Total revenue 471,883 359,370 112,513 31 
 The increase in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year, was primarily attributable to growth in our base of property management customers driving an increase in the number of property management units under management, and growth in users of our subscription and usage-based services. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we experienced growth of 15 in the number of property management units under management resulting from 7 growth in the number of property management customers, compared to the prior year. 
 Our payment services experienced increased adoption during the comparative periods as residents, property managers, and owners transacted more business online. Our tenant screening and risk mitigation services usage also increased during the comparative periods in line with the increase in units under management. A significant majority of our Value Added Services revenue comes from the use of our payment services, tenant screening services, and the risk mitigation services we make available to customers. 
 Cost of Revenue (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization) 
 Year Ended December 31, Change 2022 2021 Amount (dollars in thousands) Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 191,826 143,944 47,882 33 Percentage of revenue 40.7 40.1 Stock-based compensation, included above 2,640 2,024 616 30 Percentage of revenue 0.6 0.6 
 Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased primarily due to increases in expenditures to third-party service providers related to the delivery of our Value Added Services of 34.1 million compared to the prior year. This increase was directly associated with the increased adoption and utilization of our Value Added Services. Personnel-related costs, including performance-based compensation, necessary to support growth and key investments, increased 12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year. Allocated shared and other costs increased by 1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year, primarily related to platform infrastructure, software and other costs incurred in support of our overall growth. 
 23 

As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) fluctuates primarily based on the mix of Value Added Services revenue in the period, given the varying percentage of revenue we pay to third-party service providers. We expect cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) for the year ending December 31, 2023 to decrease as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, as we expect to leverage headcount efficiencies to offset an increase in expenditures to third-party service providers related to the delivery of our Value Added Services. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Year Ended December 31, Change 2022 2021 Amount (dollars in thousands) Sales and marketing 107,398 73,200 34,198 47 Percentage of revenue 22.8 20.4 Stock-based compensation, included above 8,681 2,329 6,352 273 Percentage of revenue 1.8 0.6 
 Sales and marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs, including performance-based compensation, necessary to support growth in the business of 23.9 million compared to the prior year. Advertising and promotion costs increased by 2.1 million primarily due to increased advertising and promotion spending to support the growth and key investments in the business. Allocated shared and other costs increased by 8.2 million year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year, primarily related to software and other costs incurred in support of our overall growth. 
 We expect sales and marketing expense for the year ending December 31, 2023 to decrease as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, as we continue to leverage headcount efficiencies. 
 
 Research and Product Development 
 Year Ended December 31, Change 2022 2021 Amount (dollars in thousands) Research and product development 111,118 65,980 45,138 68 Percentage of revenue 23.5 18.4 Stock-based compensation, included above 16,030 5,457 10,573 194 Percentage of revenue 3.4 1.5 
 Research and product development expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased primarily due to an increase in personnel-related costs including performance-based compensation, net of capitalized software development costs, of 42.8 million, compared to the prior year. Allocated shared and other costs increased by 2.3 million year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year, primarily related to software and other costs incurred in support of our overall growth. 
 We expect research and product development expenses for the year ending December 31, 2023 to increase as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, as we continue to invest in our research and product development organization to support our strategy to expand the use cases of our product capabilities to the larger customer segment.

General and Administrative 
 Year Ended December 31, Change 2022 2021 Amount (dollars in thousands) General and administrative 100,792 57,279 43,513 76 Percentage of revenue 21.4 15.9 Stock-based compensation, included above 13,584 5,531 8,053 146 Percentage of revenue 2.9 1.5 
 General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased primarily due to a net ROU and other lease-related asset impairment of 22.0 million. Personnel-related costs, including performance-based compensation, increased 15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year. Allocated shared and other costs increased 3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year, for professional fees, education and training, insurance, software and other costs to support our growth. Additionally, offsetting general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was a 1.9 million insurance recovery related to our previously disclosed settlement with the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"). 
 Excluding the impairment charge, we expect general and administrative expenses for the year ending December 31, 2023 to remain flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Year Ended December 31, Change 2022 2021 Amount (dollars in thousands) Depreciation and amortization 33,119 30,845 2,274 7 Percentage of revenue 7.0 8.6 
 Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased amortization expense associated with accumulated capitalized software development balances. 
 We expect depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ending December 31, 2023 to decrease as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 due to a decrease in amortization of accumulated capitalized software development balances. 
 Other Income, net 
 Year Ended December 31, Change 2022 2021 Amount (dollars in thousands) Other income, net 4,469 13,111 (8,642) (66) Percentage of revenue 0.9 3.6 
 Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased, compared to the prior year, primarily due to a gain of 12.8 million related to the sale of our investment in SecureDocs during the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was offset by a gain of 4.2 million associated with the WegoWise Transaction during the year ended December 31, 2022. For additional information regarding the WegoWise Transaction, refer to Note 3, Sale of Subsidiary Businesses .

The effective tax rate as compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 differs primarily due to change in valuation allowance against deferred taxes and non-deductible expenses, partially offset by state income taxes and tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation expense and research and development tax credits. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal sources of liquidity continue to be cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities, as well as cash flows generated from our operations. At December 31, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents and investment securities had an aggregate balance of 185.2 million. We have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from operations. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, investment securities, and cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. 
 Capital Requirements 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including continued market acceptance of our software solutions, changes in the number of our customers, adoption and utilization of our Value Added Services by new and existing customers, the timing and extent of the introduction of new core functionality, products and Value Added Services, and the timing and extent of our investments across our organization. Non-cancelable purchase commitments for business operations total 23.4 million as of December 31, 2022, due primarily over the next three years. Operating lease obligations totaling 65.1 million associated with leased facilities and have varying maturities with 30.1 million due over the next five years. Furthermore, our Board of Directors has authorized our management to repurchase up to 100.0 million of shares of our Class A common stock from time to time. To date, we have repurchased 4.2 million of our Class A common stock under the Share Repurchase Program. For additional information regarding our Share Repurchase Program, refer to Note 11, Stockholders' Equity . 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table presents our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands): 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities 25,365 35,391 Net cash used in investing activities (6,466) (110,459) Net cash used in financing activities (6,163) (7,348) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 12,736 (82,416) 
 Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 Our primary source of operating cash inflows is cash collected from our customers in connection with their use of our core solutions and Value Added Services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel-related expenditures and third-party costs incurred to support the delivery of our software solutions. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The net decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in employee related costs and the settlement of accounts payable offset by an increase in cash collections from customers due to higher revenue growth and a decrease in income taxes paid related to the sale of MyCase, Inc. during the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities is generally composed of purchases of investment securities, maturities and sales of investment securities, purchases of property and equipment, and additions to capitalized software development. 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 6.5 million compared to 110.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The net decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to decreases in purchases of available-for-sale investment securities and capitalization of software development costs, offset by a decrease in proceeds from sales of available-for-sale investment securities and decrease in proceeds from sales of business and equity method investments. 
 26 

Cash Used in Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities is generally composed of net share settlements for employee tax withholdings associated with the vesting of equity awards offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 6.2 million compared to 7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from stock option exercises. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 At December 31, 2022, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 
 We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment or complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Many of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require judgment. We account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The performance obligations for these contracts include access and use of our core solutions, implementation services, and customer support. Access and use of our core solutions and implementation services are considered distinct. 
 The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation. We typically have more than one standalone selling price for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we determine the standalone selling price based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration customer demographics and other factors. Fees are fixed based on rates specified in the subscription agreements, which do not provide for any refunds or adjustments. 
 Capitalized Software Development Costs 
 We believe there are two key estimates within the capitalized software balance, which are the determination of the useful life of the software and the determination of the amounts to be capitalized. 
 We determined that a three year life is appropriate for our internal-use software based on our best estimate of the useful life of the internally developed software after considering factors such as continuous developments in the technology, obsolescence and anticipated life of the service offering before significant upgrades. Based on our prior experience, internally generated software will generally remain in use for a minimum of three years before being significantly replaced or modified to keep up with evolving customer and company needs. While we do not anticipate any significant changes to this three year estimate, a change in this estimate could produce a material impact on our financial statements. 
 We determine the amount of internal software costs to be capitalized based on the amount of time spent by our software engineers on projects. Costs associated with building or significantly enhancing our software solutions and new internally built software solutions are capitalized, while costs associated with planning new developments and maintaining our software solutions are expensed as incurred. There is judgment involved in estimating the stage of development as well as estimating time allocated to a particular project. A significant change in the time spent on each project could have a material impact on the amount capitalized and related amortization expense in subsequent periods. 
 27 

Impairment of long-lived assets 
 We assess the recoverability of our long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate. An impairment charge would be recognized when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. 
 Any impairments to operating lease right of use ("ROU") assets, leasehold improvements, or other assets as a result of a sublease, abandonment, or other similar factor are assessed for impairment when a decision to do so is made and recorded as an operating expense. Similar to other long-lived assets, management tests ROU assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. For ROU and other lease-related assets, such circumstances would include subleases that do not fully recover the costs of the associated leases or a decision to abandon the use of all or part of a leased asset. We recorded a net impairment of 22.0 million consisting of 17.6 million related to ROU assets and 4.4 million related to property and equipment associated with our leased office spaces as described further in Note 9, Leases. Significant judgment and estimates are required in assessing impairment of long-lived assets, including identifying whether events or changes in circumstances require an impairment assessment, estimating future cash flows, uncertainty associated with the time period it will take to obtain a sublessee, the anticipated sublease income and determining appropriate discount rates. Our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. 
 Income Taxes 
 We recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we consider the weighting of all available positive and negative evidence, which includes, among other things, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative taxable income or losses, future projections of profitability, and the duration of statutory carryforward periods. 
 Judgment is required to measure the amount of tax benefits that can be recognized associated with uncertain tax positions. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. We recognize interest and penalties accrued with respect to uncertain tax positions, if any, in our provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 For information regarding recent accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
 
 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Investment Securities 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 114.5 million of investment securities consisting of United States government agency securities, corporate bonds, and treasury securities. The primary objective of investing in securities is to support our liquidity and capital needs. We did not purchase these investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. 
 Our investment securities are exposed to market risk due to interest rate fluctuations. While fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our interest income from our investment securities as all of these securities have fixed interest rates, changes in interest rates may impact the fair value of the investment securities. Since our investment securities are held as available for sale, all changes in fair value impact our other comprehensive (loss) income unless an investment security is considered impaired in which case changes in fair value are reported in other expense. As of December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment securities of approximately 0.7 million, and a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our investment securities of approximately 0.7 million. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model which measured an instant change in interest rates by 100 basis points as of December 31, 2022.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of AppFolio, Inc. 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AppFolio, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive (loss) income, of stockholder s equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 30 

Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 
 As described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company decided to exit and make available for sublease certain leased office spaces. Management reassessed the Company s asset groupings and evaluated the recoverability of the Company s right-of-use and other lease-related assets and determined that the carrying value of the respective asset groups was not fully recoverable. Management utilized discounted cash flow models to estimate the fair value of the asset groups taking into consideration the time period it will take to obtain a sublessee, the applicable discount rates and the anticipated sublease income and calculated the corresponding impairment loss. The Company recorded a net impairment of 22.0 million related to right-of-use assets and property and equipment associated with the leased office space. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impairment of long-lived assets is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in developing the fair value estimate of the asset groups; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s significant assumptions related to the time period it will take to obtain a sublessee and the anticipated sublease income; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the impairment of long-lived assets, including controls over the valuation of the asset groups. These procedures also included, among others (i) evaluating the reassessment of asset groupings and the recoverability of the right-of-use and other lease-related assets; (ii) testing management s process for developing the fair value estimate of the asset groups; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models; (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the discounted cash flow models; and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to the time period it will take to obtain a sublessee and the anticipated sublease income. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models and evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions related to the time period it will take to obtain a sublessee and the anticipated sublease income.

 Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth in the Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) as issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the COSO criteria, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022. 
 The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their audit report which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2022. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 4. Advancement of Expenses .

However, in the event that Indemnitee is ultimately determined not to be entitled to such indemnification or insurance recovery, as the case may be, then all amounts advanced under this Section 5 shall be repaid. 
 6. Partial Indemnity . If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for a portion of any Losses in respect of a Claim related to an Indemnifiable Event but not for the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which Indemnitee is entitled. 
 7. Contribution in the Event of Joint Liability . To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, if the indemnification and hold harmless rights provided for in this Agreement are unavailable to Indemnitee in whole or in part for any reason whatsoever, the Company, in lieu of indemnifying and holding harmless Indemnitee, shall contribute to the amount incurred by Indemnitee the entire amount incurred by Indemnitee, whether for judgments, liabilities, fines, penalties, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement and or for Expenses, in connection with any Claim relating to an Indemnifiable Event, in such proportion as is deemed fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances of such Indemnifiable Event in order to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the Company and Indemnitee as a result of the event(s) and or transaction(s) giving cause to such proceeding and or (ii) the relative fault of the Company (and its directors, officers, employees, trustees, fiduciaries and agents) and Indemnitee in connection with such event(s) and or transaction(s). 
 8. Notification and Defense of Claims . 
 (a) Notification of Claims . Indemnitee shall notify the Company in writing of any Claim which could relate to an Indemnifiable Event or for which Indemnitee could seek Expense Advances as soon as practicable following receipt by Indemnitee of written notice thereof. The written notification to the Company shall include a brief description (based upon information then available to Indemnitee) of the nature of, and the facts underlying, such Claim. The failure by Indemnitee to timely notify the Company hereunder shall not relieve the Company from any liability hereunder other than to the extent the Company s ability to participate in the defense of such claim was materially and adversely prejudiced by such failure. 
 (b) Defense of Claims . The Company shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Claim relating to an Indemnifiable Event at its own expense and, except as otherwise provided below, to the extent the Company so wishes, it may assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitee. After notice from the Company to Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense of any such Claim, the Company shall not be liable to Indemnitee under this Agreement or otherwise for any Expenses subsequently directly incurred by Indemnitee in connection with Indemnitee s defense of such Claim other than reasonable costs of investigation or as otherwise provided below. Indemnitee shall have the right to employ its own legal counsel in such 
 -6- 

Claim, but all Expenses related to such counsel incurred after notice from the Company of its assumption of the defense shall be at Indemnitee s own expense provided, however, that if (i) Indemnitee s employment of its own legal counsel has been authorized by the Company, (ii) Indemnitee s counsel has reasonably determined that there may be a conflict of interest between Indemnitee and the Company in the defense of such Claim, (iii) after a Change in Control, Indemnitee s employment of its own counsel has been approved by the Independent Counsel or (iv) the Company shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such Claim, then Indemnitee shall be entitled to retain its own separate counsel (but not more than one law firm plus, if applicable, local counsel in respect of any such Claim) and all Expenses related to such separate counsel shall be borne by the Company. 
 9. Procedure Upon Application for Indemnification . In order to obtain indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request therefor, including in such request such documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification following the final disposition of the Claim. Indemnification shall be made insofar as the Company determines Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification in accordance with Section 10 below. 
 
 -7- 

10. Determination of Right to Indemnification . 
 (a) Mandatory Indemnification Indemnification as a Witness . 
 (i) Mandatory Indemnification .

 (ii) Indemnification as a Witness . Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee s involvement in a Claim relating to an Indemnifiable Event is to prepare to serve and serve as a witness, is or was made (or asked to respond to discovery requests) or is otherwise asked to participate in a Claim, in each case, to which Indemnitee is not a party, the Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Losses actually and reasonably incurred in connection therewith to the fullest extent allowable by law. 
 (b) Standard of Conduct . To the extent that the provisions of Section 10(a) are inapplicable to a Claim related to an Indemnifiable Event that shall have been finally disposed of, any determination of whether Indemnitee has satisfied any applicable standard of conduct under Delaware law that is a legally required condition to indemnification of Indemnitee hereunder against Losses relating to such Claim and any determination that Expense Advances must be repaid to the Company (a Standard of Conduct Determination shall be made as follows 
 (i) if no Change in Control has occurred, (A) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even if less than a quorum of the Board, (B) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum (C) if there are no such Disinterested Directors or if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion addressed to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee or (D) if so directed by the Board, by the stockholders of the Company and 
 (ii) if a Change in Control shall have occurred, (A) if the Indemnitee so requests in writing, by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even if less than a quorum of the Board or (B) otherwise, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion addressed to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee. 
 The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Indemnitee against and, if requested by Indemnitee in writing, shall reimburse Indemnitee for, or advance to Indemnitee, within twenty (20) calendar days of such request, any and all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in cooperating with the Person or Persons making such Standard of Conduct Determination (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification). 
 The Company promptly will advise Indemnitee in writing with respect to any determination that Indemnitee is or is not entitled to indemnification, including a description of any reason or basis for which indemnification has been denied. 
 (c) Making the Standard of Conduct Determination . The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any Standard of Conduct Determination required under Section 10(b) to be made as promptly as practicable. Subject to the last sentence of this Section 10(c), if the Person or Persons designated to make the Standard of Conduct Determination under Section 10(b) shall not have made a determination within thirty (30) calendar days after the later of (A) receipt by the Company of a written request from Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to Section 9 (the date of such receipt being the Notification Date and (B) the selection of an Independent Counsel, if such 
 -8- 

determination is to be made by Independent Counsel, then Indemnitee shall be deemed to have satisfied the applicable standard of conduct, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee s statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii) a final judicial determination that any or all such indemnification is expressly prohibited under applicable law provided, however, that such thirty (30) calendar day period may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed an additional fifteen (15) calendar days, if the Person or Persons making such determination in good faith requires such additional time to obtain or evaluate information relating thereto and provided, further, that the foregoing provisions of this Section 10(c) shall not apply (i) if the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by the stockholders pursuant to Section 10(b)(i) of this Agreement and if (i) within fifteen (15) days after receipt by the Company of the request for such determination the Board has resolved to submit such determination to the stockholders for their consideration at an annual meeting thereof to be held within seventy-five (75) days after such receipt and such determination is made thereat, or (ii) a special meeting of stockholders is called within fifteen (15) days after such receipt for the purpose of making such determination, such meeting is held for such purpose within sixty (60) days after having been so called and such determination is made thereat . Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no determination as to entitlement of Indemnitee to indemnification under this Agreement shall be required to be made prior to the final disposition of any Claim. 
 (d) Payment of Indemnification . If, in regard to any Losses 
 (i) Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 10(a) 
 (ii) no Standard of Conduct Determination is legally required as a condition to indemnification of Indemnitee hereunder or 
 (iii) Indemnitee has been determined or deemed pursuant to Section 10(b) or Section 10(c) to have satisfied the Standard of Conduct Determination, 
 then the Company shall pay to Indemnitee, within twenty (20) calendar days after the later of (A) the Notification Date or (B) the earliest date on which the applicable criterion specified in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) is satisfied, an amount equal to the Losses to which such Indemnitee is entitled. 
 (e) Selection of Independent Counsel for Standard of Conduct Determination . If a Standard of Conduct Determination is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 10(b)(i), the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board of Directors, and the Company shall give written notice to Indemnitee advising Indemnitee of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. If a Standard of Conduct Determination is to be made by the Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 10(b)(ii), the Independent Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee, and Indemnitee shall give written notice to the Company advising it of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. In either case, Indemnitee or the Company, as applicable, may, within ten (10) calendar days after receiving written notice of selection from the other, deliver to the other a written objection to such selection provided, however, that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not satisfy the criteria set forth in the definition of Independent Counsel in Section 2, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely objection, the individual or firm so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If such written objection is properly and timely made and substantiated, (i) the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court has determined that such objection is without merit and (ii) the non-objecting party may, at its option, select an alternative Independent Counsel and give written notice to the other party advising such other party of the identity of the alternative Independent Counsel so selected, in which case the provisions of the two immediately preceding sentences, the 
 -9- 

introductory clause of this sentence and numbered clause (i) of this sentence shall apply to such subsequent selection and notice. If applicable, the provisions of clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence shall apply to successive alternative selections. If no Independent Counsel that is permitted under the foregoing provisions of this Section 10(e) to make the Standard of Conduct Determination shall have been selected within twenty (20) calendar days after the Company gives its initial notice pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 10(e) or Indemnitee gives its initial notice pursuant to the second sentence of this Section 10(e), as the case may be, either the Company or Indemnitee may petition the Delaware Court to resolve any objection which shall have been made by the Company or Indemnitee to the other s selection of Independent Counsel and or to appoint as Independent Counsel an individual or firm to be selected by the Court or such other person as the Court shall designate, and the individual or firm with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the individual or firm so appointed will act as Independent Counsel. In all events, the Company shall pay all of the reasonable fees and expenses of the Independent Counsel incurred in connection with the Independent Counsel s determination pursuant to Section 10(b) and shall fully indemnify and hold harmless such Independent Counsel against any and all expenses, claims, liabilities and damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its engagement pursuant hereto. 
 (f) Presumptions and Defenses . 
 (i) Indemnitee s Entitlement to Indemnification . In making any Standard of Conduct Determination, the Person or Persons making such determination shall presume, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that Indemnitee has satisfied the applicable standard of conduct and is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement if Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with Section 9 of this Agreement, and the Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption and establish that Indemnitee is not so entitled. Any Standard of Conduct Determination that is adverse to Indemnitee may be challenged by the Indemnitee in the Delaware Court. No determination by the Company (including by its directors or any Independent Counsel) that Indemnitee has not satisfied any applicable standard of conduct or failure by the Company to reach such a determination may be used as a defense to any legal proceedings brought by Indemnitee to secure indemnification or reimbursement or advance payment of Expenses by the Company hereunder or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard of conduct. 
 (ii) Reliance as a Safe Harbor . For purposes of this Agreement, and without creating any presumption as to a lack of good faith if the following circumstances do not exist, Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company if Indemnitee s actions or omissions to act are taken in good faith reliance upon the records of the Company, including its financial statements, or upon information, opinions, reports or statements furnished to Indemnitee by the officers or employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries in the course of their duties, or by committees of the Board or by any other Person (including legal counsel, accountants and financial advisors) as to matters Indemnitee reasonably believes are within such other Person s professional or expert competence and who has been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of the Company. In addition, the knowledge and or actions, or failures to act, of any director, officer, agent or employee of the Company shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnity hereunder. The provisions of this Section 10(f)(ii) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement. 
 (iii) No Other Presumptions . For purposes of this Agreement, the termination of any Claim by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval) or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, will not (except as otherwise provided in this Agreement) of itself create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet any applicable standard of conduct, or that indemnification hereunder is otherwise not permitted.

(iv) Defense to Indemnification and Burden of Proof . It shall be a defense to any action brought by Indemnitee against the Company to enforce this Agreement (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for Losses incurred in defending against a Claim related to an Indemnifiable Event in advance of its final disposition) that it is not permissible under applicable law for the Company to indemnify Indemnitee for the amount claimed.

unreasonably withheld.

 16. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. 
 17. Arbitration. Any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement or the Executive s employment with the Company shall be settled exclusively by arbitration, conducted before a single arbitrator in Santa Barbara, California in accordance with the JAMS Employment Rules and Procedures then in effect (available at www.jamsdr.com). The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator s award in any court having jurisdiction. In connection with any such arbitration and regardless of outcome, (a) each party shall pay all of its own costs and expenses, including, without limitation, its own legal fees and expenses, and (b) the arbitration costs shall be borne by the Company.

 6 

the subject matter of this Agreement. No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either party which are not expressly set forth in this Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and any equity award, the terms of this Agreement shall govern and control. 
 20. Representations. The Executive represents and warrants to the Company that (a) the Executive has the legal right to enter into this Agreement and to perform all of the obligations on the Executive s part to be performed under this Agreement and (b) the Executive is not a party to any agreement or understanding, written or oral, and is not subject to any restriction, which, in either case, could prevent or impair the Executive from entering into this Agreement or performing the Executive s duties and obligations under this Agreement. 
 21. Tax Matters. 
 (a) Withholding. The Company may withhold from any and all amounts payable under this Agreement or otherwise such federal, state and local taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. 
 (b) Section 409A Compliance. 
 (i) The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with, or are exempt from, Section 409A. Accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance therewith or exempt therefrom. In no event whatsoever shall the Company be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty that may be imposed on the Executive by Section 409A or damages for failing to comply with Section 409A. 
 (i) A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A. For purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a termination, termination of employment or like terms shall mean separation from service. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Executive is deemed on the date of termination to be a specified employee within the meaning of that term under Section 409A, then with regard to any payment or the provision of any benefit that is considered deferred compensation under Section 409A payable on account of a separation from service, such payment or benefit shall not be made or provided until the date which is the earlier of (A) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of such separation from service of the Executive, and (B) the date of the Executive s death, to the extent required under Section 409A. Upon the expiration of the foregoing delay period, all payments and benefits delayed pursuant to this Section 22(b)(ii) (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) shall be paid or reimbursed to the Executive in a lump sum, and any remaining payments and benefits due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein. 
 (ii) To the extent that reimbursements or other in-kind benefits under this Agreement constitute nonqualified deferred compensation for purposes of Section 409A, (A) all expenses or other reimbursements under this Agreement shall be made on or prior to the last day of the taxable year following the taxable year in which such expenses were incurred by the Executive, (B) any right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit, and (C) no such reimbursement, expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided in any taxable year shall in any way affect the 
 7 

expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other taxable year. 
 (iii) For purposes of Section 409A, the Executive s right to receive any installment payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments. Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days, the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Company. 
 (iv) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any payment under this Agreement that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation for purposes of Section 409A be subject to offset by any other amount unless otherwise permitted by Section 409A.

The Released Parties are intended to be third-party beneficiaries of this General Release, and this General Release may be enforced by each of them in accordance with the terms hereof in respect of the rights granted to such Released Parties hereunder. Terms used herein but not otherwise defined shall have the meanings given to them in the Agreement. 
 1. My employment or service with the Company and its affiliates terminated as of ________________, and I hereby resign from any position as an officer, member of the board of managers or directors (as applicable) or fiduciary of the Company or its affiliates (or reaffirm any such resignation that may have already occurred). I understand that the Severance Benefits represent, in part, consideration for signing this General Release and are not salary, wages or benefits to which I was already entitled. I understand and agree that I will not receive the Severance Benefits unless I execute this General Release and do not revoke this General Release within the time period permitted hereafter. I understand and agree that such payments and benefits are subject to the restrictive covenants set forth in Exhibit B attached to the Agreement, which (as noted below) expressly survive my termination of employment and the execution of this General Release. Such payments and benefits will not be considered compensation for purposes of any employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement maintained or hereafter established by the Company or its affiliates. 
 2. Except as provided in paragraphs 5 and 6 below and except for the provisions of the Agreement which expressly survive the termination of my employment with the Company, I knowingly and voluntarily (for myself, my heirs, executors, administrators and assigns) release and forever discharge the Company and the other Released Parties from any and all claims, suits, controversies, actions, causes of action, cross-claims, counterclaims, demands, debts, compensatory damages, liquidated damages, punitive or exemplary damages, other damages, claims for costs and attorneys fees, or liabilities of any nature whatsoever in law and in equity, both past and present (through the date that this General Release becomes effective and enforceable) and whether known or unknown, suspected, or claimed against the Company or any of the Released Parties which I, my spouse, or any of my heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, may have, which arise out of or are connected with my employment with, or my separation or termination from, the Company (including, but not limited to, any allegation, claim or violation, arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended the Civil Rights Act of 1991 the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended (including the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act) the Equal Pay Act of 1963, as amended the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 any applicable Executive Order Programs the Fair Labor Standards Act or their state or local counterparts or under any other federal, state or local civil or human rights law, or under any other local, state, or federal law, regulation or ordinance or under any public policy, contract or tort, or under common

 6. I agree that I hereby waive all rights to sue or obtain equitable, remedial or punitive relief from any or all Released Parties of any kind whatsoever in respect of any Claim, including, without limitation, reinstatement, back pay, front pay, and any form of injunctive relief. Notwithstanding the above, I further acknowledge that I am not waiving and am not being required to waive any right that cannot be waived under law, including the right to file an administrative charge or participate in an administrative investigation or proceeding provided , however , that I disclaim and waive any right to share or participate in any monetary award resulting from the prosecution of such charge or investigation or proceeding.

 11. I hereby acknowledge that Exhibit B of the Agreement shall survive as applicable therein my execution of this General Release. 
 12. I represent that I am not aware of any claim by me other than the claims that are released by this General Release. I acknowledge that I may hereafter discover claims or facts in addition to or different than those which I now know or believe to exist with respect to the subject matter of the release set forth in paragraph 2 above and which, if known or suspected at the time of entering into this General Release, may have materially affected this General Release and my decision to enter into it.
