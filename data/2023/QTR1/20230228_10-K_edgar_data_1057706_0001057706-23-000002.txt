SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE ESG PROGRAM 
OVERVIEW 

The 
Corporation 
is committed 
to 
supporting 
our 
clients, 
employees, 
shareholders 
and 
communities 
in 
which 
we 
serve. 
Our 
ESG 
 program builds on the Corporation s 
core values, including being a socially 
responsible company. 
The Corporation sees effective 
ESG 
 management as a critical step towards a sustainable, inclusive and successful future. 

 During 
2021, 
the 
Corporation 
adopted 
an 
ESG 
framework 
through 
which 
it 
establishes 
and 
communicates 
its 
ESG 
strategy 
and 
 overarching governance 
policy. 
In 2022, 
the Corporation 
continued evolving 
its ESG 
program, 
including the 
publication of 
its initial 
 First 
BanCorp. 
Environmental, 
Social 
and 
Governance 
Report 
for 
2021 
(the 
 2021 
ESG 
Report ). 
The 
2021 
ESG 
Report 
discloses 
 information 
on 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
ESG 
topics, 
including 
governance 
and 
leadership; 
responsible 
business 
practices; 
employees 
and 
 culture; 
diversity, 
equity 
and 
inclusion; 
community 
engagement; 
and 
environmental 
stewardship. 
The 
ESG 
Report 
for 
2022 
is 
 expected 
to 
be 
published 
during 
the 
second 
quarter 
of 
2023. 
Also 
in 
2022, 
the 
Corporation s 
Board 
of 
Directors 
(the 
 Board 
of 
 Directors 
or 
the 
 Board 
approved 
First 
BanCorp. s 
Sustainability 
Policy 
(the 
 Sustainability 
Policy ), 
which 
establishes 
the 
 Corporation s framework 
to address ESG matters. 

 ESG Governance 
 The Corporation s 
Board of Directors and 
executive leadership team 
share responsibilities relating 
to oversight of our 
ESG policies 
 and practices. In 
February 2022, the 
Corporate Governance and 
Nominating Committee of 
the Board of 
Directors amended its charter 
 to 
include 
oversight 
responsibility 
of 
ESG 
matters, 
and 
it 
has 
primary 
oversight 
of 
ESG 
policies, 
practices 
and 
disclosures. 
 Nonetheless, other committees 
of the Corporation s 
Board of Directors 
also play a role 
in ESG oversight in 
matters related to 
risk and 
 cybersecurity management, human capital management, investment management 
and credit risk management. 

As part of 
the ESG governance 
structure set forth 
in the Sustainability 
Policy, 
the responsibility of 
day-to-day management 
of our 
 ESG framework 
and strategy 
has been 
delegated to 
a management-level 
ESG Committee, 
comprised of 
leaders from 
different areas, 
 such 
as 
Human 
Resources, 
Enterprise 
Risk 
Management, 
Strategic 
Planning 
and 
Investor 
Relations, 
Legal 
and 
Corporate 
Affairs, 
 Marketing, Compliance, 
Finance, and 
Corporate Internal 
Audit. The 
ESG Committee 
is tasked 
with aligning 
priorities and 
initiatives 
 for the 
year, 
setting and 
monitoring 
long-term objectives 
and goals, 
and leading 
the annual 
reporting process 
on ESG 
related topics. 
 The ESG Committee reports to the Corporate Governance and Nominating 
Committee of the Board of Directors. 

 HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
 First BanCorp. 
strives to be recognized as a leading and diversified financial institution, 
offering a superior experience to our clients 
 and employees. We 
believe that the key to our success is caring about our team as much 
as we care about our customers. Our goal is to 
 be an 
employer of 
choice 
within our 
primary operating 
regions, which 
we believe 
is achieved 
and sustained 
by adding 
value 
to our 
 employees 
lives 
and 
providing 
satisfying 
and 
evolving 
work 
experience. 
The 
core 
of 
our 
employer 
value 
proposition, 
 The 
 Experience of Being 1, is our commitment to our employees wellbeing, 
success, professional development, and work environment. 
 Employees 
 As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
and 
its 
subsidiaries 
had 
3,133 
regular

nearly

 Oversight 
 The Human Resources Division manages all elements of the Corporation s 
human capital programs and strategies, including talent 
 recruiting and engagement, training and development, and compensation 
and benefits, and directly reports to the Corporation s 
Chief 
 Risk Officer. 
 The 
Human 
Resources 
Division 
efforts 
are also 
overseen by 
the 
Corporation s 
Chief 
Executive 
Officer 
(CEO) 
and 
the executive 
 management 
team 
through 
regular 
work-related 
interactions. 
Our 
leaders 
focus 
on 
strengthening 
employee 
management 
and 
 engagement 
and 
maximizing 
collaboration 
between 
departments 
and 
talents 
by 
promoting 
an 
open-door 
culture 
that 
stimulates 
 frequent communication 
between employees 
and management. 
This provides 
more opportunities 
to identify 
employees' needs, 
obtain 
 feedback 
about 
work 
experience, 
and 
adapt 
our 
employee 
engagement 
as 
we 
believe 
is 
appropriate. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Corporation s 
 Board 
of 
Directors 
and 
its 
Compensation 
and 
Benefits 
Committee 
monitor 
and 
are 
regularly 
updated 
on 
the 
Corporation s 
human 
 capital management strategies. 

8 
 Talent Acquisition 
and Retention
 First 
BanCorp. 
is 
an 
equal 
opportunity 
employer, 
which 
considers 
qualified 
candidates 
for 
employment 
to 
fill 
its 
available 
 positions. 
Our 
efforts 
are 
focused 
on 
attracting 
and 
retaining 
the 
best 
talent 
for 
the 
Corporation, 
including 
college 
graduates, 
and 
 promoting internal mobility. 
The attraction and selection process includes:
 
 Promoting and posting our vacant positions 
internally and externally. 
 
 Building our employer brand by participating in professional events and 
job fairs and maintaining a relationship with 
 universities through internship programs and career forums. 
 
 A collaboration with hiring managers to ensure an accurate match between 
role and candidate and reasonably speed up the 
 recruitment process to secure top candidates. 
 
 A robust management information system to enhance the effectiveness 
of the recruitment process and provide candidates with 
 a unique experience. 
 
 A robust on-boarding process to engage and support the new employee s 
induction process, including assignment of a 
 FirstPal from day one to help with the organizational culture transition 
and learning process. 
 We 
believe 
that 
financial 
security 
is critical 
for 
our 
employees. 
Our 
goal is to 
maintain 
compensation 
levels that 
are competitive 
 with comparable 
job categories 
in similar 
organizations. 
Our salary 
administration program 
is designed 
to provide 
compensation that 
 is 
consistent 
with 
our 
employees 
assigned 
duties 
and 
responsibilities 
in 
order 
to 
recognize 
differences 
in 
individual 
performance 
 levels and to attract the right and best talent for each job. 
 In 
addition 
to 
salary, 
some 
job 
positions 
are 
eligible 
to 
participate 
in 
variable 
pay 
programs. 
The 
Corporation 
has 
different 
 incentive 
programs 
for 
most 
of 
its 
business 
units. 
These 
incentive 
programs 
are 
periodically 
reviewed 
to 
align 
them 
to 
business 
 strategies 
and 
ensure 
sound 
risk 
management. 
Further, 
the 
Corporation s 
Management 
Award 
Program 
is 
used 
to 
recognize 
and 
 reward outstanding 
performance for 
exempt employees 
who do 
not participate 
in other 
variable pay 
programs. 
The Corporation also 
 has a 
long-term incentive 
plan for 
top-performing 
leaders and 
employees with 
high potential. 
These programs 
provide awards 
based 
 upon 
the 
Corporation s 
and 
individual s 
performance 
and 
are 
key 
for 
the 
attraction 
and 
engagement 
of 
the 
best 
talent
 . 
 The 
 Corporation s 
investment in its 
employees has resulted 
in a stable-tenured 
workforce, with an 
average tenure of 
10 years of service 
as 
 of December 
31, 2022. In 
2022, employee voluntary 
turnover rates remained 
significantly higher 
than pre-pandemic 
levels, reflecting 
 workforce challenges 
affecting most 
industries. Our 
employee voluntary 
turnover rate 
for 2022 
was 13.3 , 
mostly related 
to hourly 
 employees in call centers and branches. For high performers 
, 
employees turnover was relatively low at 5.5 .
 Talent Development 
and Engagement 
 We 
believe 
that a 
culture of 
learning and 
development 
maximizes the 
talent of 
human 
capital and 
is the 
foundation for 
sustained 
 business success and our commitment to employee engagement continues 
throughout employees time with the Corporation. 

 Our 
training 
program 
strives 
to 
reflect 
both 
employees 
and 
the 
organization s 
needs. 
The 
Corporation 
offers 
more 
than 
8,000 
 training opportunities

in-person or 
virtual classes, 
as well

projects, and 
 partial tuition reimbursement to complete a bachelor s 
or master's degree to eligible employees. Training 
is offered on various subjects 
 within five main areas: fundamentals, 
compliance and corporate governance, 
specialized technical subjects, professional 
development, 
 and leadership development. 
 In 2022

over 80 training 
topics through

 Every year around 100 new and

and

For 
new 
supervisors, 
we

a 
program 
intended 
to 
train 
in 
basic 
supervision, 
 leadership and 
communication skills, 
and our 
human resources 
policies and 
practices. In 
addition, our 
program for 
active supervisors 
 and 
managers 
encourages 
leaders 
to 
review 
their 
leadership 
skills 
with 
feedback 
received 
from 
instructors 
and 
coworkers. 
The 
 program has been delivered to 63 of our current leaders since launched, 
accounting for over 21,000 training hours. 

 In addition to these training opportunities, we have processes 
to promote professional development and career 
growth, including the 
 promotion of internal 
career opportunities, performance 
management processes, annual 
talent review, 
and robust succession 
planning. 
 We 
also 
encourage 
employees 
to 
participate 
in 
our 
commitment 
to 
our 
communities 
through 
our 
volunteer 
and 
community 
 reinvestment programs. 
In 2022, our 
employees supported 36 
organizations with 
more than 1,800

Florida, 
and 
Virgin 
Islands 
regions 
and 
 offered approximately 1,500 hours of service. 
 Health Wellness 

Health 
and 
well-being

provides 
 competitive

of 
our 
employees 
and 
their 
families 
to 
 promote 
occupational, 
physical, 
emotional, 
and 
financial 
health. 
Our 
comprehensive 
wellness 
package 
includes 
health, 
dental 
and 
 vision insurance 
offered 
through different 
insurance company 
options that 
enable employees 
to choose 
those that 
best accommodate 
 their 
and 
their 
families 
needs. 
We 
also 
offer 
life 
insurance 
and 
disability 
plans, 
as 
well 
as 
a 
defined 
contribution 
retirement 
plan 
 option where both employee and employer contribute. 
 To 
promote 
work-life 
balance,

always been 
an important 
priority.

aspects 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
and 
the 
Bank s 
activities, 
 including commercial 
and consumer 
lending, deposit 
taking, management, 
governance and 
other activities. 
As part 
of this 
regulatory 
 framework, the 
Corporation and 
the Bank 
are subject 
to extensive 
consumer financial 
regulatory legal 
and supervisory 
requirements. 
 Further, 
U.S. 
financial 
supervision 
and 
regulation 
is 
dynamic 
in 
nature, 
and 
supervisory 
and 
regulatory 
requirements 
are 
subject 
to 
 change 
as 
new 
legislative 
and 
regulatory 
actions 
are 
taken. 
Future 
legislation 
may 
increase 
the 
regulation 
and 
oversight 
of 
the 
 Corporation and the 
Bank. Any change in 
applicable laws or regulations, 
however, may 
have a material adverse 
effect on the business 
 of commercial banks and bank holding companies, including the Bank and the 
Corporation. 
 Bank Holding Company Activities and Other Limitations 
 The Corporation is registered under 
the Bank Holding Company Act 
of 1956, as amended (the 
 Bank Holding Company Act ), 
and 
 is subject to 
ongoing supervision, 
regulation and examination 
by the Federal 
Reserve Board. 
The Corporation 
is required to 
file with 
 the Federal 
Reserve Board 
periodic and 
annual reports 
and other 
information concerning 
its own 
business operations 
and those 
of its 
 subsidiaries. 
 The Bank Holding 
Company Act also permits 
a bank holding company 
to elect to become 
a financial holding 
company and engage 
 in 
a 
broader 
range 
of 
financial 
activities. 
The 
Corporation 
has 
elected 
to 
be 
a 
financial 
holding 
company 
under 
the 
Bank 
Holding 

10 
 Company Act. 
Financial holding 
companies may 
engage, directly or 
indirectly, 
in any activity 
that is determined 
to be (i) 
financial in 
 nature, (ii) incidental to 
such financial activity, 
or (iii) complementary to 
a financial activity and does 
not pose a substantial risk 
to the 
 safety 
and 
soundness 
of 
depository 
institutions 
or 
the 
financial 
system 
generally. 
The 
Bank 
Holding 
Company 
Act 
specifically 
 provides that 
the following 
activities have 
been determined 
to be 
 financial in 
nature : (i) 
lending, trust 
and other 
banking activities; 
 (ii) insurance activities; (iii) financial 
or economic advice or services; (iv) 
pooled investments; (v) securities underwriti 
ng and dealing; 
 (vi) domestic activities 
permitted for an 
existing bank holding 
company; (vii) foreign 
activities permitted for 
an existing bank 
holding 
 company; and (viii) merchant banking activities. 
 A 
financial 
holding 
company 
that 
ceases 
to 
meet 
certain 
standards 
is 
subject 
to 
a 
variety 
of 
restrictions, 
depending 
on 
the 
 circumstances, 
including 
precluding 
the 
undertaking 
of 
new 
financial 
activities 
or 
the 
acquisition 
of 
shares 
or 
control 
of 
other 
 companies. 
Until 
compliance 
is 
restored, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
Board 
has 
broad 
discretion 
to 
impose 
appropriate 
limitations 
on 
the 
 financial holding 
company s 
activities. The Corporation 
and FirstBank must 
be well-capitalized 
and well-managed 
for regulatory 
 purposes, 
and 
FirstBank 
must 
earn 
 satisfactory 
or 
better 
ratings 
on 
its 
periodic 
Community 
Reinvestment 
Act CRA 
 examinations for the Corporation to preserve its financial holding company status. 
 Under 
federal 
law 
and 
Federal 
Reserve 
Board 
policy, 
a 
bank 
holding 
company 
such 
as 
the 
Corporation 
is 
expected 
to 
act 
as 
a 
 source of strength 
to its banking 
subsidiaries and to 
commit required 
levels of support 
to them. This 
support may be 
required at times 
 when, 
absent 
such 
policy, 
the 
bank 
holding 
company 
might 
not 
otherwise 
provide 
such 
support. 
In 
the 
event 
of 
a 
bank 
holding 
 company s 
bankruptcy, 
any 
commitment 
by the 
bank holding 
company 
to a 
federal bank 
regulatory 
agency to 
maintain capital 
of a 
 subsidiary bank will 
be assumed by 
the bankruptcy trustee 
and be entitled 
to a priority 
of payment. In 
addition, any capital 
loans by a 
 bank 
holding 
company 
to 
any 
of 
its 
subsidiary 
banks 
must 
be 
subordinated 
in 
right 
of 
payment 
to 
deposits 
and 
to 
certain 
other 
 indebtedness 
of 
such 
subsidiary 
bank. 
As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
and 
the 
date 
hereof, 
FirstBank 
was 
and 
is 
the 
only 
banking 
 subsidiary of the Corporation. 
 State Chartered Non-Member Bank and Banking Laws and Regulations
 in General
 FirstBank is 
subject to 
regulation and 
examination by 
the OCIF, 
the CFPB 
and the 
FDIC, and 
is subject 
to comprehensive 
federal 
 and 
state 
(Commonwealth 
of 
Puerto 
Rico) 
regulations 
that 
regulate, 
among 
other 
things, 
the 
scope 
of 
their 
businesses, 
their 
 investments, their reserves 
against deposits, the 
timing and availability 
of deposited funds, 
and the nature 
and amount of 
collateral for 
 certain loans. 

 The 
OCIF, 
the 
CFPB 
and 
the 
FDIC 
periodically 
examine 
FirstBank 
to 
test 
the 
Bank s 
conformance 
to 
safe 
and 
sound 
banking 
 practices and 
compliance with 
various statutory 
and regulatory 
requirements. This 
oversight establishes 
a comprehensive 
framework 
 of 
permissible 
activities, 
and 
the 
supervision 
by 
the 
FDIC 
is 
also 
intended 
for 
the 
protection 
of 
the 
FDIC s 
insurance 
fund 
and 
 depositors. 
These 
regulatory 
authorities 
have 
discretion 
in 
connection 
with 
their 
supervisory 
and 
enforcement 
activities 
and 
 examination policies, including policies 
with respect to the classification of 
assets and the establishment of adequate 
loan loss reserves 
 for regulatory purposes. 
Their enforcement authority 
includes, among other 
things, the ability to 
assess civil monetary 
penalties, issue 
 cease-and-desist 
or 
removal 
orders, 
and 
initiate 
injunctive 
actions 
against 
banking 
organizations 
and 
institution-affiliated 
parties. 
In 
 general, 
these 
enforcement 
actions 
may 
be 
initiated 
for 
violations 
of 
laws 
and 
regulations 
and 
for 
engaging 
in 
unsafe 
or 
unsound 
 practices. 
In addition, 
certain bank 
actions are 
required by 
statute and 
implementing regulations. 
Other actions 
or failure 
to act 
may 
 provide the basis for enforcement action, including the filing of misleading or 
untimely reports with regulatory authorities. 
 Regulatory Capital Requirements
 The federal 
banking agencies 
have implemented 
rules for 
U.S. banks 
that establish 
minimum 
regulatory capital 
requirements, the 
 components 
of 
regulatory 
capital, 
and 
the 
risk-based 
capital 
treatment 
of 
bank 
assets 
and 
off-balance 
sheet 
exposures. 
These 
rules 
 currently 
apply 
to 
the 
Corporation 
and 
FirstBank, 
and 
generally 
are 
intended 
to 
align 
U.S. 
regulatory 
capital 
requirements 
with 
 international regulatory capital standards 
adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision Basel Committee ), in particular, 
 the international capital accord known as Basel III. 
The current rules increase the quantity and quality 
of capital required by, 
among 
 other things, establishing a minimum common equity 
capital requirement and an additional common equity 
Tier 1 capital conservation 
 buffer. 
In addition, the current rules revise and 
harmonize the bank regulators rules for 
calculating risk-weighted assets, by applying 
a 
 variation of 
the Basel 
III Standardized 
Approach for 
the risk-weighting 
of bank 
assets and 
off-balance 
sheet exposures 
to all 
U.S. 
 banking organizations other than large internationally 
active banks.
 International 
regulatory 
developments 
also 
affect 
the 
regulation 
and 
supervision 
of 
U.S. 
banking 
organizations, 
including 
the 
 Corporation 
and 
FirstBank. 
Both 
the 
Basel 
Committee 
and 
the 
Financial 
Stability 
Board 
have 
agreed 
to 
take 
action 
to 
strengthen 
 regulation and 
supervision of the 
financial system 
with greater international 
consistency, 
cooperation, and 
transparency, 
including the 
 adoption of 
Basel III 
and a 
commitment to 
raise capital 
standards and 
liquidity buffers 
within the 
banking system 
under Basel 
III. In 
 addition, 12 U.S.C. 5371 (the Collins Amendment ), 
among other things, eliminates certain trust-preferred 
securities TRuPs from 
 Tier 
1 capital. 
Preferred securities 
issued under 
the U.S. 
Treasury s 
Troubled 
Asset Relief 
Program TARP 
are exempt 
from this 
 change. 
Bank holding 
companies, such 
as the 
Corporation, were 
required to 
fully phase 
out these 
instruments from 
Tier 1 
capital by 

11 
 January 
1, 
2016; 
however, 
these 
instruments 
may 
remain 
in 
Tier 
2 
capital 
until 
the 
instruments 
are 
redeemed 
or 
mature. 
As 
of 
 December 31, 
2022, the 
Corporation had 
 178.3 million 
in TRuPs 
that were 
subject to 
a full 
phase-out from 
Tier 1 
capital under 
the 
 final regulatory capital rules discussed above.
 Consistent 
with 
Basel 
Committee 
actions 
noted 
above, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
Board 
has 
adopted 
risk-based 
and 
leverage 
capital 
 adequacy guidelines 
pursuant to which 
it assesses the 
adequacy of 
capital in examining 
and supervising a 
bank holding 
company and 
 in 
analyzing 
applications 
to 
it 
under 
the 
Bank 
Holding 
Company 
Act. 
The 
Corporation 
and 
FirstBank 
became 
subject 
to 
the 
U.S. 
 Basel III capital rules beginning on January 1, 2015.
 The 
Basel III 
rules 
require 
the 
Corporation 
to 
maintain 
an additional 
capital 
conservation 
buffer 
of 
2.5 
to 
avoid 
limitations on 
 both (i) 
capital distributions e.g.
 , repurchases 
of capital 
instruments, dividends 
and interest payments 
on capital 
instruments) and 
(ii) 
 discretionary bonus payments to executive officers and 
heads of major business lines.
 Under 
the fully 
phased-in Basel 
III rules, 
in order 
to be 
considered 
adequately 
capitalized and 
not subject 
to the 
above-described 
 limitations, 
the Corporation 
is required 
to maintain: 
(i) a 
minimum 
common equity 
Tier 
1 Capital CET1 
to risk-weighted 
assets 
 ratio of 
at least 
4.5 , plus 
the 2.5 
 capital conservation 
buffer, 
resulting in 
a required 
minimum CET1 
ratio of 
at least 
7 ; (ii) 
a 
 minimum ratio 
of total Tier 
1 capital to 
risk-weighted assets 
of at least 
6.0 , plus 
the 2.5 capital 
conservation buffer, 
resulting in 
a 
 required minimum 
Tier 
1 capital 
ratio of 
8.5 ; (iii) 
a minimum 
ratio of 
total Tier 
1 plus 
Tier 
2 capital 
to risk-weighted 
assets of 
at 
 least 8.0 , plus 
the 2.5 capital 
conservation buffer, 
resulting in a required 
minimum total capital ratio 
of 10.5 ; and 
(iv) a required 
 minimum leverage ratio of 4 , calculated as the ratio of Tier 
1 capital to average on-balance sheet (non-risk adjusted) assets. 
 The 
Basel 
III 
rules 
have 
increased 
our 
regulatory 
capital 
requirements 
and 
require 
us 
to 
hold 
more 
capital 
against 
certain 
of 
our 
 assets 
and 
off-balance 
sheet 
exposures. 
Further, 
as 
part 
of 
its 
response 
to 
the 
impact 
of 
COVID-19, 
on 
March 
31, 
2020, 
federal 
 banking agencies 
issued an 
interim final 
rule that 
provided the 
option to 
temporarily delay 
the effects 
of CECL 
on regulatory 
capital 
 for 
two years, 
followed by 
a three 
-year 
transition 
period. 
The interim 
final rule 
provides 
that, 
at the 
election 
of a 
qualified 
banking 
 organization, 
the 
initial 
impact 
of 
the 
adoption 
of 
CECL on 
retained 
earnings 
plus 25 
of 
the 
change 
in 
the 
ACL (excluding 
PCD 
 loans) from January 
1, 2020 to December 
31, 2021 will be 
delayed for two 
years and phased-in at 25 
per year beginning 
on January 
 1, 2022 
over a three 
-year period, resulting 
in a total 
transition period 
of five years. 
The Corporation 
and the Bank 
elected to phase 
in 
 the full effect of CECL on regulatory capital over the five-year transition 
period. 
 The Corporation 
and the 
Bank compute 
risk-weighted assets 
using the 
Standardized Approach 
required by 
the Basel 
III rules. 
The 
 Standardized 
Approach 
expands 
the 
risk-weighting 
categories 
from 
the 
four 
major 
categories 
under 
the 
previous 
regulatory 
capital 
 rules (0 , 20 , 50 , and 100 to a much larger and 
more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the 
assets. 
 In a 
number of 
cases, the 
Standardized Approach 
resulted in 
higher risk 
weights for 
a variety of 
asset categories. 
Specific changes 
to 
 the 
risk-weightings 
of assets 
included, 
among 
other 
things: (i) 
applying 
a 150 
risk 
weight 
instead of 
a 100 
risk 
weight 
for high 
 volatility commercial 
real estate acquisition, 
development and 
construction loans, 
(ii) assigning 
a 150 
risk weight 
to exposures 
that 
 are 90 days past due 
(other than qualifying residential 
mortgage exposures, which remain 
at an assigned risk-weighting 
of 100 ), (iii) 
 establishing a 20 credit conversion factor for the unused portion 
of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is 
 not unconditionally 
cancellable, in 
contrast to 
the 0 
risk-weighting under 
the prior 
rules and 
(iv) requiring 
capital to 
be maintained 
 against 
on-balance-sheet 
and 
off-balance-sheet 
exposures 
that 
result 
from 
certain 
cleared 
transactions, 
guarantees 
and 
credit 
 derivatives, and collateralized transactions (such as repurchase agreement 
transactions).

 Stress-Testing 
and Capital Planning Requirements
 Federal 
regulations 
currently 
do 
not 
impose 
formal 
stress-testing 
requirements 
on 
banking 
organizations 
with 
total 
assets 
of 
less 
 than 100 billion, 
such as the 
Corporation and 
FirstBank. 
The federal banking 
agencies have indicated 
through interagency guidance 
 that the 
capital planning 
and risk 
management 
practices of 
institutions with 
total assets 
of less 
than 100 
billion will 
continue 
to be 
 reviewed through the regular 
supervisory process. Notwithstanding, 
the Corporation monitors its 
capital consistent with the 
safety and 
 soundness expectations 
of the 
federal regulators 
and continues 
to perform 
internal stress 
testing as 
part of 
its annual 
capital planning 
 process. 

 Dividend Restrictions
 
The Federal 
Reserve Board 
has a 
policy 
that, as 
a matter 
of prudent 
banking, 
a bank 
holding 
company should 
generally not 
pay 
 cash 
dividends 
unless 
its 
net 
income 
available 
to 
common 
shareholders 
for 
the 
past 
four 
quarters, 
net 
of 
dividends 
previously 
paid 
 during 
that 
period, 
has 
been 
sufficient 
to 
fully 
fund 
the 
dividends 
and 
the 
prospective 
rate 
of 
earnings 
retention 
appears 
to 
be 
 consistent with the organization s 
capital needs, asset quality, 
and overall current and prospective financial condition. Furthermore, 
the 
 Federal 
Reserve Board s 
regulatory capital 
rule (Regulation 
Q) limits 
the amount 
of capital 
a bank 
holding 
company may 
distribute 
 under certain circumstances. A banking 
organization must maintain 
a capital conservation buffer 
of CET1 capital in an amount 
greater 
 than 2.5 of 
total risk weighted 
assets to avoid being 
subject to limitations on 
capital distributions. The 
Corporation is also subject 
to 
 certain restrictions 
generally imposed 
on Puerto 
Rico corporations 
with respect 
to the declaration 
and payment 
of dividends 
(i.e., that 
 dividends may 
be paid 
out only 
from the 
Corporation s 
capital surplus 
or, 
in the 
absence of 
such excess, 
from the 
Corporation s 
net 
 earnings for such fiscal year and/or the preceding fiscal year). 
 The principal 
source of 
funds for 
the Corporation, 
as a 
parent holding 
company, 
is dividends 
declared and 
paid by 
its subsidiary, 
 FirstBank. The 
ability of 
FirstBank to 
declare and 
pay dividends 
on its 
capital stock 
is regulated 
by the 
Puerto Rico 
Banking Law 
of 
 1933, 
as 
amended 
(the 
 Puerto 
Rico 
Banking 
Law ), 
the 
Federal 
Deposit 
Insurance 
Act 
(the 
 FDIA ), 
and 
FDIC 
regulations. 
In 
 general 
terms, 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
Banking 
Law 
provides 
that when 
the 
expenditures 
of a 
bank 
are greater 
than 
receipts, 
the 
excess 
of 
 expenditures over 
receipts shall 
be charged 
against undistributed 
profits of 
the bank 
and the 
balance, if 
any, 
shall be 
charged 
against 
 the required 
reserve fund 
of the 
bank. If 
the reserve 
fund is 
not sufficient 
to cover 
such balance 
in whole 
or in 
part, the 
outstanding 
 amount must 
be charged 
against the 
bank s 
capital account. 
The Puerto 
Rico Banking 
Law provides 
that, until 
said capital 
has been 
 restored to its original 
amount and the reserve 
fund to 20 of 
the original capital, the 
bank may not declare 
any dividends. In general, 
 regulations 
of 
the 
FDIA 
and 
the 
FDIC 
restrict 
the 
payment 
of 
dividends 
when 
a 
bank 
is 
undercapitalized 
(as 
discussed 
in 
Prompt 
 Corrective 
Action 
below), 
when 
a 
bank 
has 
failed 
to 
pay 
insurance 
assessments, 
or 
when 
there 
are 
safety 
and 
soundness 
concerns 
 regarding such bank. 
 The 
principal 
source 
of 
funds 
for 
the 
Corporation s 
parent 
holding 
company 
is 
dividends 
declared 
and 
paid 
by 
its 
subsidiary, 
 FirstBank. The ability 
of FirstBank to declare 
and pay dividends on 
its capital stock is 
regulated by the Puerto 
Rico Banking Law, 
the 
 Federal 
Deposit 
Insurance 
Act 
(the 
 FDIA ), 
and 
FDIC 
regulations. 
In 
general 
terms, 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
Banking 
Law 
provides 
that 
 when 
the 
expenditures 
of 
a 
bank 
are 
greater 
than 
receipts, 
the 
excess 
of 
expenditures 
over 
receipts 
shall 
be 
charged 
against 
 undistributed profits 
of the bank 
and the balance, 
if any, 
shall be charged 
against the required 
reserve fund 
of the bank. 
If the 
reserve 
 fund 
is not 
sufficient 
to cover 
such 
balance 
in whole 
or 
in part, 
the outstanding 
amount must 
be 
charged 
against the 
bank s 
capital 
 account. The Puerto Rico Banking 
Law provides that, until said capital 
has been restored to its original 
amount and the reserve fund 
to 
 20 
of 
the 
original 
capital, 
the 
bank 
may 
not 
declare 
any 
dividends. 
In 
general, 
the 
FDIA 
and 
the 
FDIC 
regulations 
restrict 
the 
 payment of 
dividends when 
a bank 
is undercapitalized 
(as discussed 
in 
 Prompt 
Corrective 
Action
 
below), when 
a bank 
has failed 
to 
 pay insurance assessments, or when there are safety and soundness concerns regarding 
such bank.

in assets with 
 respect to consumer financial products and services. 
 The 
CFPB s 
primary 
functions 
include 
the 
supervision 
of 
 covered 
persons 
(broadly 
defined 
to 
include 
any 
person 
offering 
or 
 providing a consumer 
financial product or 
service and any 
affiliated service 
provider) for compliance 
with federal 
consumer financial 
 laws. 
It 
implements 
amendments 
to 
and 
has 
primary 
authority 
to 
enforce 
the 
federal 
consumer 
financial 
laws, 
including 
the 
Equal 
 Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth 
in Lending Act TILA and the 
Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act RESPA ), 
among others. 
 The 
CFPB 
also 
has 
broad 
powers 
to 
prescribe 
rules 
applicable 
to 
a 
covered 
person 
or 
service 
provider 
in 
connection 
with 
any 
 transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, 
or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. 

13 
 Among other 
actions, the 
CFPB has 
issued regulations 
setting forth 
mortgage servicing 
rules that 
apply to 
the Bank, 
which affect 
 consumer notices 
regarding delinquency, 
foreclosure alternatives, 
modification applications, 
interest rate 
adjustments and 
options for 
 avoiding 
 force-placed 
insurance. 
Further, 
the 
CFPB has 
adopted 
rules and 
forms 
that 
combine 
certain 
disclosures 
that 
consumers 
 receive in connection 
with applying for and closing on a mortgage loan under the TILA and the RESPA. 
 The Volcker 
Rule 

 Section 13 of the Bank Holding 
Company Act (commonly known as 
the Volcker 
Rule), generally prohibits a banking 
entity such as 
 the Corporation or the 
Bank from acquiring or 
retaining any ownership 
in, or acting as sponsor 
to, a hedge fund 
or private equity fund 
 covered 
fund ). 
The 
Volcker 
Rule 
also 
prohibits 
these 
entities 
from 
engaging, 
for 
their 
own 
account, 
in 
short-term 
proprietary 
 trading of certain securities, derivatives, commodity futures and options on 
these instruments. 

 The Corporation and 
the Bank are not engaged 
in proprietary trading as 
defined in the Volcker 
Rule. In addition, the 
Corporation 
 has reviewed its investments and concluded that they are not considered 
covered funds under the Volcker 
Rule. 

 Community Reinvestment Act and Home Mortgage Disclosure Act Regulations 

 The CRA encourages 
banks to help meet 
the credit needs of 
the local communities in 
which they offer 
services, including low- and 
 moderate-income individuals, consistent with the safe and sound operation 
of the bank. 
 The 
CRA 
requires 
the 
federal 
supervisory 
agencies, 
as 
part 
of 
the 
general 
examination 
of 
supervised 
banks, 
to 
assess 
a 
bank s 
 record of meeting the 
credit needs of its 
community, 
assign a performance rating, 
and take such record 
and rating into account 
in their 
 evaluation 
of certain 
applications by 
such bank, 
such as 
an application 
for approval 
of a 
merger 
or the 
establishment of 
a branch. 
A 
 rating of 
less than satisfactory 
could result 
in the denial 
of such applications. 
The CRA 
also requires 
all institutions 
to make 
public 
 disclosure of their CRA ratings. FirstBank received a satisfactory CRA rating in 
its most recent examination by the FDIC. 
 In 
June 
2022, 
the 
U.S. 
federal 
banking 
regulatory 
agencies 
issued 
a 
joint 
proposal 
to 
amend 
their 
regulations 
implementing 
the 
 CRA. 
The 
proposed 
rules 
would 
materially 
revise 
the 
current 
CRA 
framework, 
including 
new 
assessment 
area 
requirements, 
new 
 methods of calculating 
credit for lending, investment, 
and service activities, and 
additional data collection and 
reporting requirements. 
 The proposed rule 
included analysis indicating 
a significant increase in 
the thresholds for large 
banks to receive Outstanding 
ratings 
 in the future. 
 USA PATRIOT 
Act and Other Anti-Money Laundering Requirements 

 As a regulated 
depository institution, 
FirstBank is subject 
to the 
Bank Secrecy 
Act, which imposes 
a variety of 
reporting and 
other 
 requirements, 
including 
the requirement 
to file 
suspicious 
activity and 
currency 
transaction 
reports that 
are designed 
to assist 
in the 
 detection and prevention 
of money laundering, 
terrorist financing and 
other criminal activities. 
In addition, under 
Title III 
of the USA 
 PATRIOT 
Act of 2001, 
all financial institutions 
are required to 
identify their customers, 
adopt formal and 
comprehensive anti-money 
 laundering programs, 
scrutinize or 
prohibit certain 
transactions of 
special concern, 
and be 
prepared to 
respond to 
inquiries from 
U.S. 
 law enforcement agencies concerning their customers and their transactions. 

 On 
January 
1, 
2021, 
major 
legislative 
amendments 
to 
U.S. 
anti-money 
laundering 
requirements 
became 
effective 
through 
the 
 enactment 
of 
Division 
F 
of 
the 
National 
Defense 
Authorization 
Act 
for 
fiscal 
year 
2021, 
otherwise 
known 
as 
the 
Anti-Money 
 Laundering 
Act 
of 
2020 AML 
Act ). 
The 
AML 
Act 
includes 
a 
variety 
of 
provisions 
designed 
to 
modernize 
the 
anti-money 
 laundering 
regulatory 
regime 
and 
remediate 
gaps 
in 
the 
U.S. s 
approach 
to 
anti-money 
laundering 
and 
countering 
the 
financing 
of 
 terrorism, 
including the 
creation of 
a national 
database of 
absence corporate 
beneficial ownership 
along 
with significantly 
enhanced 
 reporting 
requirements, 
increased 
penalties 
for 
Bank 
Secrecy 
Act 
violations, 
clarification 
of 
Suspicious 
Activity 
Report 
filing 
and 
 sharing 
requirements, 
and 
provisions 
addressing 
the 
adverse 
consequences 
of 
 de-risking, 
namely, 
the 
practice 
of 
financial 
 institutions termination or 
limitation of business relationships 
with clients or classes 
of clients in order 
to manage the risks 
associated 
 with such clients. 
 Regulations implementing the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA 
PATRIOT 
Act are published and primarily enforced by 
the Financial 
 Crimes Enforcement Network FinCEN ), a bureau of the U.S. Treasury. 
Failure of a financial institution, such as the Corporation 
or 
 the 
Bank, 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
Bank 
Secrecy 
Act 
or 
the 
USA 
PATRIOT 
Act 
could 
have 
serious 
legal 
and 
 reputational 
consequences 
for 
the 
institution, 
including 
the 
possibility 
of 
regulatory 
enforcement 
or 
other 
legal 
actions, 
such 
as 
 significant 
civil 
monetary 
penalties. 
The 
Corporation 
is 
also 
required 
to 
comply 
with 
federal 
economic 
and 
trade 
sanctions 
 requirements enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC ), a bureau 
of the U.S. Treasury. 

 The Corporation believes 
it has adopted appropriate 
policies, procedures and controls 
to address compliance with 
the Bank Secrecy 
 Act, USA 
PATRIOT 
Act and 
economic/trade 
sanctions requirements, 
and to 
implement banking 
agency, 
FinCEN, OFAC 
and 
other 
 U.S. Treasury regulations.

 Financial Privacy and Cybersecurity 
 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley 
Act limits the ability 
of financial institutions to 
disclose non-public information 
about consumers to non-
 affiliated 
third 
parties. 
These 
limitations 
require 
disclosure 
of 
privacy 
policies 
to 
consumers 
and, 
in 
some 
circumstances, 
allow 
 consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to 
a non-affiliated third party. 

 The 
federal 
banking 
regulators 
regularly 
issue 
guidance 
regarding 
cybersecurity 
intended 
to 
enhance 
cyber 
risk 
management 
 standards among financial 
institutions. A financial 
institution is expected 
to establish multiple 
lines of defense 
and to ensure 
their risk 
 management processes 
address the 
risk posed 
by potential 
threats to 
the institution. 
A financial 
institution s 
management is 
expected 
 to 
maintain 
sufficient 
processes 
to 
effectively 
respond 
and 
recover 
the 
institution s 
operations 
after 
a 
cyber-attack. 
A 
financial 
 institution 
is 
also 
expected 
to 
develop 
appropriate 
processes 
to 
enable 
recovery 
of 
data 
and 
business 
operations 
if 
a 
critical 
service 
 provider 
of 
the institution 
falls 
victim 
to 
this type 
of 
a 
cyber-attack. 
The Corporation s 
Information 
Security 
Program 
reflects 
these 
 requirements. 
 Limitations on Transactions with Affiliates 
and Insiders 
 Certain transactions between FDIC-insured 
banks financial institutions such 
as FirstBank and its affiliates 
are governed by Sections 
 23A and 
23B of the 
Federal Reserve Act 
and by 
Federal Reserve 
Regulation W. 
An affiliate 
of a bank 
is, in general, 
any corporation 
 or entity 
that controls, 
is controlled 
by, 
or is 
under common 
control with 
the bank, 
including the 
bank s 
parent holding 
company and 
 any companies that are controlled by such holding company. 
 Generally, 
Sections 23A and 23B of 
the Federal Reserve Act (i) 
limit the extent to which 
the bank or its subsidiaries 
may engage in 
 covered 
transactions 
with 
any 
one 
affiliate 
to 
an 
amount 
equal 
to 
10 
of 
such 
bank s 
capital 
stock 
and 
surplus, 
and 
contain 
an 
 aggregate limit 
on all 
such transactions 
with all 
affiliates to 
an amount 
equal to 20 
of such 
bank s 
capital stock and 
surplus and 
(ii) 
 require that 
all covered 
transactions be 
on terms 
that are 
substantially the 
same, or 
at least 
as favorable 
to the 
bank or 
affiliate, 
as 
 those 
provided 
to 
a 
non-affiliate. 
The 
term 
 covered 
transaction 
includes 
the 
making 
of 
loans, 
purchase 
of 
assets, 
issuance 
of 
a 
 guarantee, credit 
derivatives, securities 
lending and 
other similar 
transactions entailing 
the provision 
of financial 
support by 
the bank 
 to an affiliate. In 
addition, loans or other extensions 
of credit by the bank to 
the affiliate are required 
to be collateralized in accordance 
 with the requirements set forth in Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. 

 In 
addition, 
Sections 
22(h) 
and 
(g) 
of 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
Act, 
implemented 
through 
Regulation 
O, 
place 
restrictions 
on 
 commercial bank loans to executive officers, 
directors, and principal stockholders of 
the bank and its affiliates. Under 
Section 22(h) of 
 the Federal Reserve 
Act, bank loans to 
a director, an 
executive officer, 
a greater than 10 
stockholder of the 
bank, and certain related 
 interests of these persons, 
may not exceed, together 
with all other outstanding 
loans to such persons 
and affiliated interests, 
the bank s 
 limit on loans 
to one borrower, 
which is generally 
equal to 15 
of the bank s 
unimpaired capital and 
surplus in the 
case of loans 
that 
 are not fully secured, 
and an additional 10 of 
the bank's unimpaired capital 
and unimpaired surplus in 
the case of loans that 
are fully 
 secured by 
readily marketable 
collateral having 
a market 
value at 
least equal 
to the 
amount of 
the loan. 
Section 22(h) 
of the 
Federal 
 Reserve Act also requires 
that loans to directors, 
executive officers, and 
principal stockholders be made 
on terms that are substantially 
 the same 
as offered 
in comparable 
transactions to 
other persons 
and also 
requires prior 
board approval 
for certain 
loans. In 
addition, 
 the 
aggregate 
amount 
of 
extensions 
of 
credit 
by 
a 
bank 
to 
insiders 
cannot 
exceed 
the 
bank s 
unimpaired 
capital 
and 
surplus. 
 Furthermore, Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act places additional 
restrictions on loans to executive officers. 
 Executive Compensation 
 The federal banking agencies have 
adopted interagency guidance governing 
incentive-based compensation programs, 
which applies 
 to 
all 
banking 
organizations 
regardless 
of 
asset 
size. 
This 
guidance 
uses 
a 
principles-based 
approach 
to 
ensure 
that 
incentive-based 
 compensation arrangements 
appropriately tie 
rewards to 
longer-term performance 
and do 
not undermine 
the safety 
and soundness 
of 
 banking organizations 
or create 
undue risks 
to the 
financial system. 
The interagency 
guidance is 
based on 
three major 
principles: (i) 
 balanced risk-taking 
incentives; (ii) compatibility 
with effective 
controls and 
risk management; and 
(iii) strong 
corporate governance. 

 The guidance further provides 
that, where appropriate, the 
banking agencies will take supervisory 
or enforcement action to ensure 
that 
 material deficiencies that pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the organization 
are promptly addressed. 

 In May 2016, the federal financial regulators proposed 
regulations (first proposed in 2011) governing 
incentive-based compensation 
 practices at 
covered 
banking institutions, 
which 
would 
include, 
among 
others, 
all banking 
organizations 
with assets 
of 
 1 billion 
or 
 greater. 
Portions of these 
proposed rules would 
apply to the 
Corporation and FirstBank. 
Those applicable provisions 
would generally 
 (i) 
prohibit 
types 
and 
features 
of 
incentive-based 
compensation 
arrangements 
that 
encourage 
inappropriate 
risk 
because 
they 
are 
 excessive 
or 
 could 
lead 
to 
material 
financial 
loss 
at 
the 
banking 
institution; 
(ii) 
require 
incentive-based 
compensation 
 arrangements to 
adhere to 
three basic 
principles: (1) 
a balance 
between risk 
and reward; 
(2) effective 
risk management 
and controls; 
 and 
(3) 
effective 
governance; 
and 
(iii) 
require 
appropriate 
board 
of 
directors 
(or 
committee) 
oversight 
and 
recordkeeping 
and 

15 
 disclosures 
to 
the 
banking 
institution s 
primary 
regulatory 
agency. 
The 
nature 
and 
substance 
of 
any 
final 
action 
to 
adopt 
these 
 proposed rules, and the timing of any such action, are not known at this time. 
 On October 26, 
2022, the SEC also 
finalized a rule 
that directs stock exchanges 
to require listed companies 
to implement clawback 
 policies 
to 
recover 
incentive-based 
compensation 
from 
current 
or 
former 
executive 
officers 
in 
the 
event 
of 
certain 
financial 
 restatements, 
and requires 
companies to 
disclose their 
clawback policies 
and their 
actions under 
those policies. 
The stock 
exchanges 
 will be required to file their proposed listing standards with the SEC for 
approval no later than 90 days following the publication of 
the 
 final rules in 
the Federal Register, 
which must be 
effective no 
later than one 
year following 
such publication. 
The rules are 
therefore 
 not expected to take effect until mid-2023 at the earliest. 
 Prompt Corrective Action 

 The 
 prompt 
corrective 
action 
provisions 
of 
the 
FDIA 
require 
the 
federal 
bank 
regulatory 
agencies 
to 
take 
prompt 
corrective 
 action 
against 
any 
insured 
depository 
institution institutions 
that 
are 
undercapitalized. 
The 
FDIA 
establishes 
five 
capital 
 categories: 
well-capitalized, 
adequately 
capitalized, 
undercapitalized, 
significantly 
undercapitalized, 
and 
critically 
undercapitalized. 
 Well-capitalized institutions 
significantly exceed the required minimum level for each relevant 
capital measure. 

 A bank s 
capital category 
may not 
constitute 
an accurate 
representation 
of the 
overall financial 
condition 
or prospects 
of a 
bank, 
 such 
as 
the 
Bank, 
and 
should 
be 
considered 
in 
conjunction 
with 
other 
available 
information 
regarding 
the 
financial 
condition 
and 
 results of operations of such bank. 
 Deposit Insurance 
 FirstBank 
is 
subject 
to 
FDIC 
deposit 
insurance 
assessments, 
which 
increased 
for 
all 
banks, 
including 
FirstBank, 
following 
the 
 increase 
in 
deposit 
insurance 
coverage 
to 
up 
to 
 250,000 
per 
customer 
and 
the 
FDIC s 
expanded 
authority 
to 
increase 
insurance 
 premiums implemented 
by the 
Dodd-Frank Act. 
The FDIA 
further requires 
that the 
designated reserve 
ratio for 
the DIF 
for any 
year 
 not be 
less than 
1.35 of 
estimated insured 
deposits or 
the comparable 
percentage of 
the new 
deposit assessment 
base. 
In addition, 
 the FDIC 
was required 
to take 
the necessary 
actions for 
the reserve 
ratio to 
reach 1.35 
of estimated 
insured deposits 
by September 
 30, 2020. 
The FDIC 
managed to 
reach the 
goal early, 
achieving a 
reserve ratio 
of 1.36 
in September 
2018. However, 
in the 
third 
 quarter of 
2020, the 
FDIC announced 
that the 
reserve ratio 
of the 
DIF fell 
nine basis 
points between 
the first 
and second 
quarters of 
 2020, 
from 1.39 
to 1.30 . 
The decline 
was attributed 
to an 
unprecedented 
surge 
in deposits. 
The FDIC 
approved 
a plan 
that is 
 expected to restore 
the DIF to 
at least 1.35 
within eight years, 
as required by 
the FDIA. Under 
the plan, the 
FDIC will maintain 
the 
 current 
schedules 
of assessment 
rates for 
all banks; 
monitor 
deposit 
balance 
trends, 
potential losses 
and 
other 
factors 
that affect 
the 
 reserve 
ratio; 
and 
provide 
updates 
to 
its 
loss 
and 
income 
projections 
at 
least twice 
a 
year. 
The 
FDIC has 
also 
adopted 
a 
final 
rule 
 raising its 
industry target 
ratio of 
reserves to 
insured deposits 
to 2 , 
65 basis 
points above 
the statutory 
minimum, but 
the FDIC 
has 
 indicated that it does not project that goal to be met for several years. 

 On October 18, 2022, 
the FDIC adopted 
a final rule, applicable 
to all insured depository 
institutions, to increase 
initial base deposit 
 insurance assessment rate schedules 
uniformly by 2 basis points, 
beginning in the first quarterly 
assessment period of 2023. 
The FDIC 
 also 
concurrently 
maintained 
the 
designated 
reserve 
ratio 
for 
the 
DIF 
at 
2 
for 
2023. 
The 
increase 
in 
assessment 
rate 
schedules 
is 
 intended to increase 
the likelihood that 
the reserve ratio 
of the DIF 
reaches the statutory 
minimum of 
1.35 by the 
statutory deadline 
 of September 30, 2028. The new assessment rate schedules 
will remain in effect unless and until the reserve 
ratio meets or exceeds 2 
 in order 
to support growth 
in the DIF 
and progress 
toward the FDIC s 
long-term goal 
of a 2 
designated reserve 
ratio. Progressively 
 lower assessment 
rate schedules 
will take 
effect when 
the reserve 
ratio reaches 
2 and 
again when 
it reaches 
2.5 . The 
Corporation 
 estimates an increase 
of approximately 56 
in deposit insurance 
expense for 2023 
compared to the 
FDIC insurance 
expense levels in 
 2022. 
 FDIC Insolvency Authority
 Under 
Puerto 
Rico banking 
laws, the 
OCIF may 
appoint 
the FDIC 
as conservator 
or receiver 
of a 
failed or 
failing 
FDIC-insured 
 Puerto Rican bank, and 
the FDIA authorizes the FDIC 
to accept such an appointment. 
In addition, the FDIC has 
broad authority under 
 the FDIA 
to appoint 
itself as 
conservator 
or receiver 
of a 
failed or 
failing state 
bank, including 
a Puerto 
Rican bank. 
If the 
FDIC is 
 appointed 
conservator 
or 
receiver 
of 
a 
bank 
upon 
the 
bank s 
insolvency 
or 
the 
occurrence 
of 
other 
events, 
the 
FDIC 
may 
sell 
or 
 transfer some, part or all 
of a bank s 
assets and liabilities to another bank, 
or liquidate the bank and pay 
out insured depositors, as well 
 as uninsured 
depositors and 
other creditors 
to the 
extent of 
the closed 
bank s 
available assets. 
As part 
of its 
insolvency authority, 
the 
 FDIC has 
the authority, 
among other 
things, to 
take possession 
of and 
administer the 
receivership 
estate, 
pay 
out estate 
claims, and 
 repudiate or 
disaffirm certain 
types of 
contracts to 
which the 
bank was 
a party 
if the 
FDIC believes 
such contract 
is burdensome 
and 
 its disaffirmance 
will aid 
in 
the 
administration 
of the 
receivership. 
The 
FDIA 
provides 
that, in 
the 
event 
of 
the 
liquidation 
or 
other 
 resolution of 
an insured 
depository institution, 
including the 
Bank, the 
claims of 
depositors of 
the institution 
(including the 
claims of 
 the 
FDIC 
as 
subrogee 
of 
insured 
depositors) 
and 
certain 
claims 
for 
administrative 
expenses 
of 
the 
FDIC 
as 
a 
receiver 
would 
have 
 priority over 
other general 
unsecured claims 
against the 
institution. If 
the Bank 
were to 
fail, insured 
and uninsured 
depositors, along 

16 
 with the 
FDIC, would 
have priority 
in payment 
ahead of 
unsecured, non-deposit 
creditors, including 
the Corporation, 
with respect 
to 
 any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution. 
 Activities and Investments 
 The 
principal 
activities 
of 
FDIC-insured, 
state-chartered 
banks, 
such 
as 
FirstBank, 
are 
generally 
limited 
to 
those 
that 
are 
 permissible for national 
banks. Similarly, 
under regulations dealing 
with equity investments, an 
insured state-chartered bank 
generally 
 may not directly 
or indirectly acquire or 
retain any equity 
investments of a type, 
or in an amount, 
that is not permissible 
for a national 
 bank. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank System 
 FirstBank is 
a member 
of the 
FHLB system. 
The FHLB 
system consists 
of eleven 
regional FHLBs 
governed and 
regulated by 
the 
 Federal 
Housing 
Finance 
Agency. 
The 
FHLBs 
serve 
as 
reserve 
or 
credit 
facilities 
for 
member 
institutions 
within 
their 
assigned 
 regions. 

 FirstBank is a member 
of the FHLB of 
New York 
and, as such, 
is required to 
acquire and hold 
shares of capital 
stock in the 
FHLB 
 of New York 
in an amount calculated 
in accordance with the 
requirements set forth 
in applicable laws and 
regulations. FirstBank is in 
 compliance 
with 
the 
stock 
ownership 
requirements 
of 
the 
FHLB 
of 
New 
York. 
All 
loans, 
advances 
and 
other 
extensions 
of 
credit 
 made 
by 
the 
FHLB 
to 
FirstBank 
are 
secured 
by 
a 
portion 
of 
FirstBank s 
mortgage 
loan 
or 
securities 
portfolios, 
certain 
other 
 investments and the capital stock of the FHLB held by FirstBank. 
 The board of 
directors of each 
FHLB can increase 
the minimum investment 
requirements if it 
has concluded that 
additional capital 
 is required to meet its own regulatory capital requirements. Any 
increase in the minimum investment requirements outside of 
specified 
 ranges requires 
the approval of 
the Federal Housing 
Finance Agency. 
Because the extent 
of any obligation 
to increase our 
investment 
 in any of 
the FHLBs depends 
entirely upon 
the occurrence of 
a future 
event, the 
amount of any 
future investment 
in the capital 
stock 
 of the FHLBs is not determinable. 
 Ownership and Control
 Because 
of 
FirstBank s 
status 
as 
an 
FDIC-insured 
bank, 
as 
defined 
in 
the 
Bank 
Holding 
Company 
Act, 
the 
Corporation, 
as 
the 
 owner of 
FirstBank s 
common stock, 
is subject to 
certain restrictions 
and disclosure 
obligations under 
various federal laws, 
including 
 the 
Bank 
Holding 
Company 
Act 
and 
the 
Change 
in 
Bank 
Control 
Act 
(the 
 CBCA ). 
Regulations 
adopted 
pursuant 
to 
the 
Bank 
 Holding Company Act and 
the CBCA generally require prior 
Federal Reserve Board or other 
federal banking agency approval or 
non-
 objection for an acquisition 
of control of an insured 
institution (as defined in 
the Act) or holding 
company thereof by any person 
(or 
 persons acting in 
concert). Control is deemed 
to exist if, among 
other things, a person 
(or group of persons 
acting in concert) 
acquires 
 25 or more 
of any class of 
voting stock of 
an insured institution 
or holding company 
thereof. Under the CBCA, 
control is presumed 
 to exist 
subject to 
rebuttal if 
a person 
(or group 
of persons 
acting in 
concert) acquires 
10 or 
more of 
any class 
of voting 
stock and 
 either (i) the 
corporation has 
registered securities under 
Section 12 
of the Exchange 
Act, or (ii) 
no person (or 
group of persons 
acting 
 in 
concert) 
will own, 
control 
or 
hold 
the 
power 
to 
vote 
a 
greater 
percentage 
of that 
class of 
voting 
securities 
immediately 
after 
the 
 transaction. 
The 
concept 
of 
acting 
in 
concert 
is 
broad 
and 
subject 
to 
certain 
rebuttable 
presumptions, 
including, 
among 
others, 
that 
 relatives, business 
partners, management 
officials, affiliates 
and others 
are presumed 
to be acting 
in concert 
with each other 
and their 
 businesses. The regulations of the FDIC implementing the CBCA are generally 
similar to those described above. 

 The Puerto 
Rico Banking 
Law requires 
the approval 
of the 
OCIF for 
changes in 
control of 
a Puerto 
Rico bank. 
See Puerto 
Rico 
 Banking Law below for further detail. 
 Standards for Safety and Soundness 
 The 
FDIA 
requires 
the 
FDIC 
and 
other 
federal 
bank 
regulatory 
agencies 
to 
prescribe 
standards 
of 
safety 
and 
soundness. 
Bank 
 regulators 
have 
various 
remedies 
available 
if 
they 
determine 
that 
the 
financial 
condition, 
capital 
resources, 
asset 
quality, 
earnings 
 prospects, management, 
liquidity, 
or other 
aspects of 
a banking 
organization s 
operations are 
unsatisfactory. 
The regulators 
may also 
 take action 
if they 
determine that 
the banking 
organization or 
its management 
is violating 
or has 
violated any 
law or 
regulation. The 
 regulators 
have 
the 
power 
to, 
among 
other 
things, 
prohibit 
unsafe 
or 
unsound 
practices, 
require 
affirmative 
actions 
to 
correct 
any 
 violation 
or 
practice, 
issue 
administrative 
orders 
that 
can 
be 
judicially 
enforced, 
direct 
increases 
in 
capital, 
direct 
the 
sale 
of 
 subsidiaries 
or 
other 
assets, 
limit 
dividends 
and 
distributions, 
restrict 
growth, 
assess 
civil 
monetary 
penalties, 
remove 
officers 
and 
 directors, and terminate deposit insurance. 
 Engaging in 
unsafe or 
unsound practices 
or failing 
to comply 
with applicable 
laws, regulations, 
and supervisory 
agreements could 
 subject 
the 
Corporation, 
its 
subsidiaries, 
and 
their 
respective 
officers, 
directors, 
and 
institution-affiliated 
parties 
to 
the 
remedies 
 described above, 
and other 
sanctions. In 
addition, the 
FDIC may 
terminate a 
bank s 
deposit insurance 
upon a 
finding that 
the bank s 

17 
 financial condition is unsafe or unsound 
or that the bank has engaged in unsafe 
or unsound practices or has violated 
an applicable rule, 
 regulation, order, or condition enacted 
or imposed by the bank s regulatory 
agency. 
 Brokered Deposits
 FDIC regulations 
adopted 
under the 
FDIA govern 
the receipt 
of brokered 
deposits by 
banks. Well 
-capitalized 
institutions are 
not 
 subject 
to 
limitations 
on 
brokered 
deposits, 
while 
adequately-capitalized 
institutions 
are 
able 
to 
accept, 
renew 
or 
rollover 
brokered 
 deposits only 
with a 
waiver from 
the FDIC 
and subject 
to certain 
restrictions on 
the interest 
paid on 
such deposits. 
Undercapitalized 
 institutions 
are 
not 
permitted 
to 
accept 
brokered 
deposits. 
In 
October 
2020, 
the 
FDIC 
adopted 
revisions 
to 
its 
brokered 
deposit 
 regulations that became 
effective on April 
1, 2021, with 
full compliance extended 
to January 1, 
2022. For brokered 
deposits, the final 
 rule established 
a new framework 
for analyzing 
certain parts of 
the deposit 
broker definition, 
including a 
new interpretation 
for the 
 primary purpose exception and the 
business relationships that meet the exception. 
Pursuant to this revision, during the fourth 
quarter 
 of 2021, certain non-maturity deposits previously reported as brokered 
deposits were recharacterized as non-brokered deposits. 
 COVID-Related Regulatory Activities 
 
During 2020, the federal 
banking agencies took several 
actions to mitigate the 
stress on regulated banks 
resulting from the COVID-
 19 
pandemic. 
These 
actions 
were 
generally 
designed 
to 
facilitate 
the 
ability 
of 
banks 
to 
provide 
responsible 
credit 
and 
liquidity 
to 
 businesses and individuals 
affected by 
the COVID-19 pandemic, 
and mitigate the 
distorting effects 
under regulatory 
capital and other 
 requirements 
resulting 
from 
the 
pandemic. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
CECL 
regulatory 
capital 
relief 
discussed 
above, 
the 
banking 
agencies 
 adopted regulations 
that, among 
other things: 
neutralized the 
regulatory capital 
and liquidity 
effects 
of banks 
participating 
in certain 
 COVID-related 
Federal 
Reserve 
liquidity 
facilities; 
deferred 
appraisal 
and 
valuation 
requirements 
after 
the 
closing 
of 
certain 
 residential 
and 
commercial 
real 
estate 
transactions; 
provided 
temporary 
relief 
for 
banks 
from 
the 
FDIC s 
audit 
and 
reporting 
 requirements 
for banks 
that experienced 
large 
cash inflows 
resulting 
from participation 
in the 
SBA s 
PPP and 
other COVID-related 
 facilities, or 
otherwise resulting 
from the 
effects of 
government stimulus 
efforts. 
These regulatory 
actions were 
taken in 
conjunction 
 with 
federal 
financial 
regulatory 
efforts 
to 
encourage 
banks 
and 
other 
depositories 
to 
provide 
responsible 
credit 
and 
other 
financial 
 assistance to consumers and small businesses in response to the pandemic. 

 Puerto Rico Banking Law
 As 
a 
commercial 
bank 
organized 
under 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
Commonwealth 
of 
Puerto 
Rico, 
FirstBank 
is 
subject 
to 
supervision, 
 examination and regulation by the 
commissioner of OCIF (the Commissioner 
pursuant to the Puerto Rico 
Banking Law of 1933, as 
 amended (the Banking Law ). 
 The Banking Law 
contains various provisions 
relating to FirstBank 
and its affairs, 
including its incorporation 
and organization, 
the 
 rights and responsibilities of 
its directors, officers and 
stockholders and its corporate powers, 
lending limitations, capital requirements, 
 and investment requirements. In addition, 
the Commissioner is given extensive rule-making 
power and administrative discretion under 
 the Banking Law. 
 The Banking Law requires 
every bank to maintain 
a legal reserve, which shall 
not be less than 
20 of its demand 
liabilities, except 
 government deposits (federal, 
state and municipal) that 
are secured by actual 
collateral. The reserve is required 
to be composed of 
any 
 of 
the 
following 
securities 
or 
a 
combination 
thereof: 
(i) legal 
tender 
of 
the 
United 
States; 
(ii) checks 
on 
banks 
or 
trust 
companies 
 located in any 
part of Puerto 
Rico that are 
to be presented 
for collection during 
the day following 
the day on 
which they are 
received; 
 (iii) money deposited 
in other 
banks provided 
said deposits 
are authorized 
by the 
Commissioner and 
subject to 
immediate collection; 
 (iv) federal 
funds 
sold 
to any 
Federal 
Reserve 
Bank 
and 
securities 
purchased 
under 
agreements to 
resell 
executed 
by the 
bank 
with 
 such funds 
that are 
subject to 
be repaid 
to the 
bank on 
or before 
the close 
of the 
next 
business day; 
and 
(v) any other 
asset that 
the 
 Commissioner identifies from time to time. 
 Section 
17 
of 
the 
Banking 
Law 
permits 
Puerto 
Rico 
commercial 
banks 
to 
make 
loans 
to 
any 
one 
person, 
firm, 
partnership 
or 
 corporation in an aggr 
egate amount of up 
to 15 of the sum 
of: (i) the bank s 
paid-in capital; (ii) the bank s 
reserve fund; (iii) 50 of 
 the bank s 
retained earnings, subject 
to certain limitations; 
and (iv) any other 
components that the 
Commissioner may determine 
from 
 time to time. If such loans are secured by 
collateral worth at least 25 of the amount of the 
loan, the aggregate maximum amount may 
 reach 33.33 of 
the sum of 
the bank s 
paid-in capital, reserve 
fund, 50 of 
retained earnings, subject 
to certain limitations, 
and such 
 other components 
that the 
Commissioner may 
determine from 
time to 
time. There 
are no 
restrictions under 
the Banking 
Law on 
the 
 amount of loans that may 
be wholly secured by 
bonds, securities and other 
evidences of indebtedness of 
the government of the 
United 
 States, 
or 
of 
the 
Commonwealth 
of 
Puerto 
Rico, 
or 
by 
bonds, 
not 
in 
default, 
of 
municipalities 
or 
instrumentalities 
of 
the 
 Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. 

 The Banking Law 
requires that Puerto 
Rico commercial banks prepare 
each year a balance 
summary of their 
operations and submit 
 such balance 
summary 
for approval 
at a 
regular meeting 
of stockholders, 
together with 
an explanatory 
report thereon. 
The Banking 

18 
 Law also requires 
that at least 
10 of the 
yearly net income 
of a Puerto 
Rico commercial bank 
be credited annually 
to a reserve 
fund 
 until such reserve fund is in amount equal to the total paid-in-capital of the bank. 
 The 
Banking 
Law 
also 
provides 
that 
when 
the 
expenditures 
of 
a 
Puerto 
Rico 
commercial 
bank 
are 
greater 
than 
its 
receipts, 
the 
 excess of the expenditures 
over receipts must be 
charged against the 
undistributed profits of the 
bank, and the balance, 
if any, 
charged 
 against 
the 
reserve 
fund, 
as a 
reduction 
thereof. 
If 
there 
is no 
reserve 
fund 
sufficient 
to cover 
such balance 
in 
whole or 
in 
part, 
the 
 outstanding amount 
must be 
charged against 
the capital 
account and 
no dividend 
may be declared 
until said 
capital has 
been restored 
 to its original amount and the amount in the reserve fund equals 20 of the original 
capital. 
 The Finance Board, which 
is composed of nine members 
from enumerated Puerto Rico 
Government agencies, instrumentalities and 
 public 
corporations, 
including 
the 
Commissioner, 
has 
the 
authority 
to 
regulate 
the 
maximum 
interest 
rates 
and 
finance 
charges 
that 
 may be 
charged on 
loans to 
individuals 
and unincorporated 
businesses in 
Puerto Rico. 
The current 
regulations of 
the Finance 
Board 
 provide that the applicable 
interest rate on loans to 
individuals and unincorporated 
businesses, including real estate 
development loans 
 but excluding certain 
other personal and 
commercial loans 
secured by mortgages 
on real estate 
properties, is 
to be determined 
by free 
 competition. Accordingly, 
the regulations do 
not set a maximum 
rate for charges 
on retail installment 
sales contracts, small 
loans, and 
 credit card purchases. Furthermore, there is no 
maximum rate set for installment sales contracts involving 
motor vehicles, commercial, 
 agricultural and industrial equipment, commercial electric appliances and 
insurance premiums. 
 International Banking Center Regulatory Act of Puerto Rico IBE Act 52 

 The business and operations 
of FirstBank International Branch FirstBank IBE or the 
 IBE division of FirstBank 
and FirstBank 
 Overseas Corporation (the IBE 
subsidiary of FirstBank) are subject 
to supervision and regulation 
by the Commissioner. 
FirstBank and 
 FirstBank 
Overseas 
Corporation 
were 
created 
under 
Puerto 
Rico 
Act 
52-1989, 
as 
amended, 
known 
as 
the 
 International 
Banking 
 Center 
Regulatory 
Act 
(the 
IBE 
Act 
52), 
which 
provides 
for 
total 
Puerto 
Rico 
tax 
exemption 
on 
net 
income 
derived 
by 
an 
IBE 
 operating in 
Puerto Rico 
on the specific 
activities identified 
in the 
IBE Act 
52. An 
IBE that 
operates as 
a unit 
of a 
bank pays 
income 
 taxes at the corporate standard 
rates to the extent that 
the IBE s net 
income exceeds 20 of the bank s 
total net taxable income. Under 
 the IBE Act 52, certain 
sales, encumbrances, assignments, mergers, 
exchanges or transfers of shares, 
interests or participation(s) in the 
 capital 
of 
an 
IBE 
may 
not be 
initiated 
without 
the 
prior 
approval 
of the 
Commissioner. 
The 
IBE 
Act 
52 
and 
the regulations 
issued 
 thereunder 
by 
the 
Commissioner 
(the 
 IBE 
Regulations 
limit 
the 
business 
activities 
that 
may 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
an 
IBE. 
Such 
 activities are limited in part to persons and assets located outside of Puerto 
Rico. 
 Pursuant to 
the IBE Act 
52 and the 
IBE Regulations, 
each of FirstBank 
IBE and FirstBank 
Overseas Corporation 
must maintain 
in 
 Puerto 
Rico 
books 
and 
records 
of 
its 
transactions 
in 
the 
ordinary 
course 
of 
business. 
FirstBank 
IBE 
and 
FirstBank 
Overseas 
 Corporation 
are also 
required to 
submit to 
the Commissioner 
quarterly 
and annual 
reports of 
their financial 
condition and 
results of 
 operations, including annual audited financial statements. 
 The IBE Act 
52 empowers 
the Commissioner 
to revoke 
or suspend, after 
notice and hearing, 
a license issued 
thereunder if, 
among 
 other things, the IBE fails to 
comply with the IBE Act 52, the IBE 
Regulations or the terms of its license, or 
if the Commissioner finds 
 that the business or affairs of the IBE are conducted in a manner 
that is not consistent with the public interest. 
 In 2012, the Puerto Rico 
government approved Act Number 
273 Act 273 ). 
Act 273 replaces, prospectively, 
IBE Act 52 with the 
 objective of 
improving the 
conditions for 
conducting international 
financial transactions 
in Puerto Rico. 
An IBE 
existing on 
the date 
 of approval 
of Act 
273, such 
as FirstBank 
IBE and 
FirstBank Overseas 
Corporation, can 
continue operating 
under IBE 
Act 52, 
or it 
 can 
voluntarily 
convert 
to 
an 
International 
Financial 
Entity IFE 
under 
Act 
273 
so 
it 
may 
broaden 
its 
scope 
of 
Eligible 
IFE 
 Activities, as defined 
below, 
and obtain 
a grant of 
tax exemption under 
Act 273. As 
of the date 
of the issuance 
of this Annual 
Report 
 on Form 10-K, FirstBank IBE and FirstBank Overseas Corporation 
are operating under IBE Act 52. 

19 
 IFEs 
are 
licensed 
by 
the 
Commissioner 
and 
authorized 
to conduct 
certain 
Act 
273 
specified 
financial 
transactions Eligible 
IFE 
 Activities ). Once licensed, an 
IFE can request a grant 
of tax exemption Tax 
Grant from the Puerto Rico 
Department of Economic 
 Development 
and Commerce, 
which will 
enumerate 
and secure 
the following 
tax benefits 
provided by 
Act 273 
as contractual 
rights 
 i.e.
 , regardless of future changes in Puerto Rico law) for a 15-year period: 
 (i)
 to the IFE: 

a fixed 4 Puerto Rico income tax rate on the net income derived by the IFE from 
its Eligible IFE Activities; and 
 
 full property and municipal license tax exemptions on such activities. 

 (ii)
 to its shareholders: 

6 income tax rate on distributions to Puerto Rico resident 
shareholders of earnings and profits derived from the Eligible IFE 
 Activities; and 

full Puerto Rico income tax exemption on such distributions to non-Puerto 
Rico resident shareholders. 

The primary purpose of IFEs 
is to attract Unites States and 
foreign investors to Puerto Rico. 
Consequently, 
Act 273 authorizes IFEs 
 to engage 
in traditional 
banking and 
financial transactions, 
principally 
with non-residents 
of Puerto 
Rico. Furthermore, 
the scope 
of 
 Eligible IFE Activities encompasses a wider variety of transactions than 
those previously authorized to IBEs. 

 Act 
187, 
as 
amended, 
enacted 
on 
November 
17, 
2015, 
requires 
an 
IBE 
to 
obtain 
from 
the 
Commissioner 
a 
Certificate 
of 
 Compliance every two years that certifies its compliance with the provisions 
of IBE Act 52. 
 Puerto Rico Income Taxes 
 Under the 
Puerto Rico Internal 
Revenue Code 
of 2011, 
as amended (the 
 2011 PR 
Code ), the 
Corporation and 
its subsidiaries are 
 treated 
as 
separate 
taxable 
entities 
and 
are 
not 
entitled 
to 
file 
consolidated 
tax 
returns 
and, 
thus, 
the 
Corporation 
is 
generally 
not 
 entitled 
to 
utilize 
losses 
from 
one 
subsidiary 
to 
offset 
gains 
in 
another 
subsidiary. 
Accordingly, 
to 
obtain 
a 
tax 
benefit 
from 
a 
net 
 operating 
loss NOL ), 
a 
particular 
subsidiary 
must 
be 
able 
to 
demonstrate 
sufficient 
taxable 
income 
within 
the 
applicable 
NOL 
 carry-forward 
period. 
The 2011 
PR Code 
provides 
a dividend 
received deduction 
of 100 
on dividends 
received from 
 controlled 
 subsidiaries subject to taxation in Puerto Rico and 85 on dividends 
received from other taxable domestic corporations. 

The 
Corporation 
has 
maintained 
an 
effective 
tax 
rate 
lower 
than 
the 
maximum 
statutory 
rate 
in 
Puerto 
Rico, 
which 
has 
resulted 
 mainly 
from 
investments 
in 
government 
obligations 
and 
MBS generally 
exempt 
from 
U.S. and 
Puerto 
Rico 
income 
taxes and 
from 
 doing business 
through an 
IBE unit 
of the 
Bank, and 
through the 
Bank s 
subsidiary, 
FirstBank Overseas 
Corporation, whose 
interest 
 income and gain on sales is exempt from Puerto Rico income taxation. 
 United States Income Taxes 

 As 
a 
Puerto 
Rico 
corporation, 
First 
BanCorp. 
is 
treated 
as 
a 
foreign 
corporation 
for 
U.S. 
and 
USVI 
income 
tax 
purposes 
and, 
 accordingly, 
is generally 
subject to 
U.S. and 
USVI income 
tax only 
on its income 
from sources 
within the 
U.S. and 
USVI or 
income 
 effectively 
connected with 
the conduct 
of a 
trade or 
business in 
those jurisdictions. 
Any such 
tax paid

 Risk Factors 
 Below 
is a 
discussion 
about material 
risks 
and 
uncertainties that 
could 
impact 
the Corporation s 
businesses, 
results 
of operations 
 and financial condition, 
including by causing 
the Corporation s 
actual results to differ 
materially from those projected 
in any forward-
 looking statements. Other risks 
and uncertainties, including those 
not currently known to the 
Corporation or its management and 
those 
 that 
the 
Corporation 
or 
its management 
currently 
deems 
to 
be 
immaterial, 
could 
also 
materially 
adversely 
affect 
the Corporation 
in 
 future periods. Thus, the following 
should not be considered a complete 
discussion of all of the risks and 
uncertainties the Corporation 
 may face. See the discussion under Forward-Looking Statements, in 
this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 RISKS RELATING TO 
THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUR INDUSTRY 

 The impacts 
of rising 
interest rates 
and inflation 
may reduce 
demand for 
new loan 
originations and 
refinancings and 
increase 
 competition for borrowers, thus reducing net interest income. 

 Shifts in 
short-term 
interest rates 
have 
reduced net 
interest income 
in the 
past and, 
in the 
future, may 
reduce net 
interest income, 
 which 
is the 
principal 
component 
of our 
earnings. Net 
interest income 
is the 
difference 
between 
the amounts 
received by 
us on 
our 
 interest-earning assets and the 
interest paid by us on 
our interest-bearing liabilities. Differences 
in the re-pricing structure of 
our assets 
 and liabilities 
may result 
in changes 
in our 
profits when 
interest rates 
change. 
For instance, 
higher interest 
rates increase 
the cost 
of 
 mortgage and 
other loans 
to consumers 
and businesses 
and may 
reduce future 
demand for 
such loans, 
which may 
negatively impact 
 our 
profits 
by 
reducing 
the 
amount 
of 
loan 
interest 
income 
due 
to 
declines 
in 
volume. 
Interest 
rates 
are 
highly 
sensitive 
to 
many 
 factors that 
are beyond 
our control, 
including general 
economic conditions, 
inflationary trends, 
changes in 
government spending 
and 
 debt issuances and 
policies of various 
governmental and 
regulatory agencies, 
in particular, 
the Federal Reserve. 
Throughout 2022 
the 
 Federal Reserve raised 
the target range 
for the federal 
funds rate on seven 
separate occasions and 
has indicated that 
ongoing increases 
 may be appropriate. 
 Additionally, 
basis risk is 
the risk of 
adverse consequences resulting 
from unequal changes 
in the difference, 
also referred to 
as the 
 spread or 
basis, between 
the rates 
for two 
or more 
different 
instruments with 
the same 
maturity and 
occurs when 
market rates 
for 
 different financial 
instruments or 
the indices 
used to 
price assets and 
liabilities change 
at different 
times or 
by different 
amounts. For 
 example, the interest expense 
for liability instruments might 
not change by the 
same amount as interest income 
received from loans 
or 
 investments. 
To 
the 
extent 
that 
the 
interest 
rates 
on 
loans 
and 
borrowings 
change 
at 
different 
rates 
and 
by 
different 
amounts, 
the 
 margin between 
our variable rate-based 
assets and the cost 
of the interest-bearing 
liabilities might be 
compressed and adversely 
affect 
 net interest income. 

 Further, 
rising interest 
rates reduce 
the value 
of our 
fixed-rate securities. 
Any unrealized 
loss from 
these portfolios 
impacts other 
 comprehensive 
income, stockholders 
equity, 
and the 
tangible common 
equity ratio. 
Any realized 
loss from 
these portfolios 
impacts 
 regulatory capital ratios. 

 Changes in prepayments may adversely affect net interest income. 
 Net 
interest 
income 
could 
also 
be 
affected 
by 
prepayments 
of 
MBS. 
Generally, 
when 
rates 
rise, 
prepayments 
of 
principal 
and 
 interest 
will 
decrease, 
and 
the 
duration 
of 
MBS 
securities 
will 
increase. 
Conversely, 
when 
rates 
fall, 
prepayments 
of 
principal 
and 
 interest 
will 
increase, 
and 
the 
duration 
of 
mortgage-backed 
securities 
will 
decrease. 
Such 
acceleration 
in 
the 
prepayments 
of 
MBS 
 would lower yields on 
these securities, as the amortization 
of premiums paid upon 
the acquisition of these securities 
would accelerate. 
 Conversely, 
acceleration in 
the prepayments 
of MBS 
would increase 
yields on 
securities purchased 
at a 
discount, as 
the accretion 
of 
 the discount 
would 
accelerate. Also, 
net interest 
income 
in future 
periods might 
be affected 
by our 
investment 
in callable 
securities 
 because decreases in interest rates might prompt the early redemption of such securities. 
 The transition 
from LIBOR 
to alternative 
rates and 
other potential 
interest rate 
reforms may 
affect the 
interest rates 
we pay 
or 
 receive. 

A transition away 
from the widespread 
use of LIBOR to 
alternative rates is 
underway and will 
continue until full 
cessation of this 
 reference 
rate. 
These 
changes 
may 
cause 
such 
rates 
to 
perform 
differently 
than 
in 
the 
past, 
or 
to 
disappear 
entirely, 
or 
have 
other 
 consequences which cannot be predicted. 
 A group 
of market 
participants convened 
by the 
Federal 
Reserve, 
the 
Alternative 
Reference 
Rate Committee 
(the 
 ARRC ), 
has 
 selected 
the 
Secured 
Overnight 
Financing 
Rate SOFR 
as 
its 
recommended 
alternative 
to 
LIBOR. 
The 
Federal 
Reserve 
Bank 
of 
 New 
York 
started 
to 
publish 
SOFR 
in 
April 
2018. SOFR 
is 
a 
broad 
measure 
of 
the 
cost 
of 
overnight 
borrowings 
collateralized 
by 
 Treasury 
securities 
that 
was 
selected 
by 
the 
ARRC 
due 
to 
the 
depth 
and 
robustness 
of 
the 
U.S. 
Treasury 
repurchase 
market. 
The 
 passage 
of 
the 
Adjustable 
Interest 
Rate 
Act 
(the 
 LIBOR 
Act 
by 
U.S. 
Congress, 
and 
the 
Federal 
Reserve s 
implementing 
rule, 
 should decrease 
the risk 
of contracts 
that are 
not remediated 
prior to 
the cessation 
deadline by 
providing the 
terms for 
a transition 
to 
 SOFR. 

22 
 The 
market 
transition 
away 
from 
LIBOR 
to 
an 
alternative 
reference 
rate, 
such 
as 
SOFR, 
is 
complex 
and 
could 
have 
a 
range 
of 
 adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
In particular, any such transition could: 
 
 Adversely 
affect 
the 
interest 
rates 
received 
or 
paid 
on, 
the 
revenue 
and 
expenses 
associated 
with 
or 
the 
value 
of 
the 
 Corporation s 
LIBOR-based 
assets 
and 
liabilities, 
which 
include 
certain 
variable 
rate 
loans, 
primarily 
commercial 
and 
 construction 
loans, 
private 
label 
MBSs, 
the 
Corporation s 
junior 
subordinated 
debentures, 
and 
certain 
other 
financial 
 arrangements such 
as derivatives. 
As of 
December 31, 
2022, the 
most significant 
of the Corporation s 
LIBOR-based assets 
 and liabilities consisted of 
 1.4 billion of variable-rate 
commercial and construction 
loans (including unused commitments), 
 124.4 
million 
of 
Puerto 
Rico 
municipalities 
bonds 
held 
as 
part 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
held-to-maturity 
debt 
securities 
 portfolio, 44.6 
million of 
U.S. agencies 
debt securities 
and private 
label MBS 
held as 
part of 
the Corporation s 
available-
 for-sale debt securities portfolio, and 183.8 million of junior subordinated 
debentures; 
 
 Prompt 
inquiries 
or 
other 
actions 
from 
regulators 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
preparation 
and 
readiness 
for 
the 
 replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate; and 
 
 Result in 
disputes, 
litigation 
or 
other 
actions 
with 
counterparties 
regarding 
the 
interpretation 
and 
enforceability 
of 
certain 
 fallback language in LIBOR-based contracts. 

 The 
transition 
away 
from 
LIBOR 
to 
an 
alternative 
reference 
rate 
has 
required 
the 
transition 
to, 
or 
development 
of, 
appropriate 
 systems and analytics 
to effectively 
transition the Corporation s 
risk management and 
other processes from 
LIBOR-based products 
to 
 those based 
on the 
applicable alternative 
reference rate, 
such as 
SOFR. The 
LIBOR Transition 
Working 
Group LTWG ), 
which is 
 composed 
by 
officers 
of 
the 
major 
areas 
affected 
such 
as 
Treasury, 
Legal, 
Corporate 
Loans, 
Credit, 
Operations, 
Systems, 
Asset-
 Liability Management, Risk, Accounting, 
Financial Reporting, Public Relations, and 
Strategic Planning, are in charge 
of executing the 
 LIBOR transition workplan. 
The LTWG 
is overseen by the Corporation s 
Management Investments 
Asset-Liability Committee and 
 the Board 
of Directors 
Asset-Liability 
Committee. 
Effective 
December 
31, 2021, 
the Corporation 
discontinued 
originations that 
use 
 U.S. 
Dollar 
LIBOR 
as 
a 
reference 
rate. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Corporation 
continues 
working 
with 
the 
update 
of 
systems, 
processes, 
 documentation 
and 
models, 
with 
additional 
updates 
expected 
through 
2023. 
There 
can 
be 
no 
guarantee 
that 
these 
efforts 
will 
 successfully mitigate the operational risks associated with the transition away 
from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate. 
 The manner and impact of the transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference 
rate, as well as the effect of these developments on 
 our funding costs, loan and investment securities portfolios, asset-liability management, 
and business, is uncertain. 

 Difficult market 
and general 
economic conditions 
have affected 
the financial 
industry and 
may continue 
to adversely 
affect us 
 in the future. 
 Given that most of our business is in Puerto Rico and the 
U.S. and given the degree of interrelation 
between Puerto Rico s economy 
 and that 
of the 
U.S., we 
are exposed 
to downturns 
in the 
U.S. economy, 
including factors 
such as 
employment levels 
in the 
U.S. and 
 real estate 
valuations. 
The deterioration 
of these 
conditions adversely 
affected 
us in 
the past 
and in 
the future 
could adversely 
affect 
 the 
credit 
performance 
of 
mortgage 
loans, 
and 
result 
in 
significant 
write-downs 
of 
asset 
values 
by 
financial 
institutions, 
including 
 government-sponsored entities as well as major commercial banks 
and investment banks. 

 In particular, we may face the following 
risks: 

Our ability 
to assess the 
creditworthiness of 
our customers 
may be impaired 
if the models 
and approaches 
we use to 
select, 
 manage, and underwrite the loans become less predictive of future behaviors. 

The 
models 
used 
to 
estimate 
losses 
inherent 
in 
the 
credit 
exposure, 
particularly 
those 
under 
CECL, 
require 
difficult, 
 subjective, and 
complex judgments, 
including forecasts 
of economic 
conditions and 
how these 
economic predictions 
might 
 impair 
the 
ability 
of 
the borrowers 
to 
repay 
their 
loans, which 
may 
no longer 
be 
accurately estimated 
and 
which 
may, 
in 
 turn, impact the reliability of the models. 

Our 
ability 
to 
borrow 
from 
other 
financial 
institutions 
or 
to 
engage 
in 
sales 
of 
mortgage 
loans 
to 
third 
parties 
(including 
 mortgage 
loan 
securitization 
transactions 
with 
government-sponsored 
entities 
and 
repurchase 
agreements) 
on 
favorable 
 terms, or at 
all, could 
be adversely 
affected by 
further disruptions 
in the capital 
or credit 
markets or 
other events, 
including 
 deteriorating investor expectations. 

Competitive dynamics 
in the 
industry could 
change as 
a result 
of strategic 
growth opportunities 
in connection 
with current 
 market conditions. 

23 
 
 Expected 
future 
regulation 
of 
our 
industry 
may 
increase 
our 
compliance 
costs 
and 
limit 
our 
ability 
to 
pursue 
business 
 opportunities. 

There may be downward pressure on our stock price. 

 Any deterioration 
of economic 
conditions in 
the U.S. 
and disruptions 
in the 
financial markets 
could adversely 
affect our 
ability to 
 access capital, 
our business, 
financial condition, 
and results 
of operations. 
Unfavorable or 
uncertain economic 
and market 
conditions 
 have 
been 
and 
could 
cause 
declines 
in 
economic 
growth, 
business 
activity 
or 
investor 
or 
business 
confidence 
limitations 
on 
the 
 availability or 
increases in 
the cost 
of credit 
and capital 
increases in inflation 
or interest rates 
high unemployment 
natural disasters 
 epidemics and pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic); or a combination 
of these or other factors. 
 Additionally, 
the 
residential 
mortgage 
loan 
origination 
business 
is 
impacted 
by 
home 
values 
and 
has 
historically 
been 
cyclical, 
 enjoying periods of strong growth and profitability followed by periods 
of shrinking volumes and industry-wide losses. During periods 
 of rising interest 
rates, including the 
series of interest rate 
increases that occurred 
in 2022, the refinancing 
of many mortgage 
products 
 tends to decrease as the economic incentives for borrowers to refinance their 
existing mortgage loans are reduced. 

 Any sustained 
period of 
increased delinquencies, 
foreclosures, or 
losses could 
adversely affect 
our ability 
to sell 
loans, the 
prices 
 we receive 
for loans, 
the values 
of mortgage 
loans held 
for sale, 
or residual 
interests in 
securitizations, which 
could adversely 
affect 
 our 
financial 
condition 
and 
results 
of 
operations. 
In 
addition, 
any 
additional 
material 
decline 
in 
real 
estate 
values 
would 
further 
 weaken the loan-to-value 
ratios and increase 
the possibility of 
loss if a 
borrower defaults. In 
such event, we 
will be subject 
to the risk 
 of loss on such real estate arising from borrower defaults to the extent not covered 
by third-party credit enhancement. 
 The currently 
evolving situation 
related to 
the ongoing 
COVID-19 pandemic 
may impact 
the Corporation s 
business, financial 
 condition and results of operations.
 The ongoing COVID-19 
pandemic created a global 
public health crisis that has 
resulted in challenging 
economic conditions for our 
 business 
and 
is 
likely 
to 
continue 
to 
do 
so. 
The 
economic 
impact 
of 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic 
has 
caused 
significant 
volatility 
and 
 disruption 
in the 
financial markets 
of Puerto 
Rico and 
the other 
markets in 
which the 
Corporation operates. 
Further, 
the uncertainty 
 surrounding 
future 
economic 
conditions 
has 
challenged 
management's 
ability 
to 
estimate 
the 
pandemic's 
impact 
on 
credit 
quality, 
 revenues, and assets values. 
 The Corporation 
may also 
face residual 
risk related 
to its 
participation in 
the SBA PPP 
program established 
by the 
CARES Act 
of 
 2020. 
The Corporation s 
participation 
in 
the 
SBA PPP 
and 
any 
other 
such 
programs 
or 
stimulus 
packages 
may 
give 
rise to 
claims, 
 including 
by governments, 
regulators, 
or customers 
or through 
class action 
lawsuits, or 
judgments 
against the 
Corporation 
that 
may 
 result in the 
payment of damages 
or the imposition 
of fines, penalties 
or restrictions by 
regulatory authorities, or 
result in reputational 
 harm. 
The 
occurrence 
of 
any 
of 
the 
foregoing 
could 
have 
a 
material 
adverse 
effect 
on 
the 
Corporation s 
results 
of 
operations 
or 
 financial condition. 

 The 
full 
extent 
to which 
the COVID-19 
pandemic 
further 
impacts 
our 
business, results 
of 
operations, 
and 
financial 
condition, 
as 
 well 
as 
our 
regulatory 
capital 
and 
liquidity 
ratios, 
will 
depend 
on 
future 
developments, 
which 
are 
highly 
uncertain 
and 
cannot 
be 
 predicted, including 
the duration of 
the COVID-19 
pandemic and its 
impact on 
the global economy, 
as well as 
any future 
resumption 
 of responsive 
actions taken by 
governmental authorities 
and other third 
parties. Even after 
the COVID-19 
pandemic has subsided, 
we 
 may continue 
to experience materially 
adverse impacts to 
our business and 
our results of 
operations as 
a result of 
its global economic 
 impact. 
 We operate in a highly 
competitive industry and market area. 

 We 
face 
substantial 
competition 
in 
all 
areas 
of 
our 
operations 
from 
a 
variety 
of 
different 
competitors, 
including 
other 
banks, 
 insurance 
companies, 
mortgage 
banking 
companies, 
small 
loan 
companies, 
automobile 
financing 
companies, 
leasing 
companies, 
 brokerage 
firms 
with 
retail 
operations, 
credit 
unions, 
certain 
retailers, 
fintech 
companies 
and 
digital 
platforms. 
The 
Corporation s 
 ability 
to 
compete 
effectively 
depends 
on 
the 
relative 
performance 
of 
its 
products, 
the 
degree 
to 
which 
the 
features 
of 
its 
products 
 appeal 
to 
customers, 
and 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
the 
Corporation 
meets 
clients 
needs 
and 
expectations. 
The 
Corporation s 
ability 
to 
 compete also depends on its ability to attract and retain professional and other 
personnel, and on its reputation. 
 The 
Corporation 
encounters 
intense competition 
in attracting 
and 
retaining 
deposits 
and 
in 
its consumer 
and 
commercial 
lending 
 activities. The 
Corporation 
competes for 
loans with 
other financial 
institutions. 
The Corporation s 
ability to 
originate loans 
depends 
 primarily on the rates and 
fees charged and 
the service it provides to 
its borrowers in making 
prompt credit decisions. There 
can be no 
 assurance that 
in the 
future the 
Corporation will 
be able 
to increase 
its deposit 
base, originate 
loans in 
the manner 
or on 
the terms 
on 
 which it has done so in the past, or otherwise compete effectively.

 The Corporation s 
credit quality and 
the value of the 
portfolio of Puerto 
Rico government securities 
has been, and 
in the future 
 may 
be, 
adversely 
affected 
by 
Puerto 
Rico s 
economic 
condition, 
and 
may 
be 
affected 
by 
actions 
taken 
by 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
 government or the PROMESA oversight board to address the ongoing fiscal and 
economic challenges in Puerto Rico. 
 A significant 
portion 
of the 
Corporation s 
business activities 
and credit 
exposure 
is concentrated 
in the 
Commonwealth of 
Puerto 
 Rico, which has experienced an economic and fiscal crisis for more than a decade. 
 On 
November 
10, 
2022, 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
Planning 
Board PRPB 
presented 
the 
Economic 
Report 
to 
the 
Governor, 
which 
 provides 
an 
analysis 
of 
Puerto 
Rico s 
economy 
during 
fiscal 
year 
2021 
and 
a 
short-term 
forecast 
for 
fiscal 
years 
2022 
and 
2023. 
 According to the 
PRPB, Puerto Rico s 
real gross national 
product GNP expanded 
by 1.0 in fiscal 
year 2021, significantly 
above 
 the PRPB s 
original 
baseline projection 
of a 
2.0 
contraction. According 
to the 
report, real 
GNP growth 
was primarily 
driven by 
a 
 sharp increase 
in personal 
consumption expenditures 
reflecting the 
relaxation of 
COVID-related restrictions, 
as well 
as the 
impact of 
 the 
substantial 
disaster 
relief funding 
deployed 
over 
the period. 
To 
a 
lesser extent, 
growth 
in 
fiscal 
year 
2021 
was also 
driven 
by a 
 higher level of 
investments in machinery, 
equipment, and construction. 
These favorable variances 
were partially offset 
by an increase 
 in imports, 
a reduction 
in exports, 
and a 
negative change 
in the 
level of 
inventories. For 
fiscal years 
2022 and 
2023, the 
Puerto Rico 
 economy is forecasted to grow 4.0 and 0.7 in real 
terms, according to the PRPB s baseline 
projection. Among the key assumptions 
 included in 
this forecast 
is the 
positive impact 
expected from 
the ongoing 
disbursements of 
disaster recovery 
funds 2.8 
billion and 
 4.0 billion 
in fiscal 
years 2022 
and 2023, 
respectively), 
as well 
as the 
stimulus from 
remaining pandemic 
relief funds 1.1 billion 
 and 632 
million in 
fiscal years 
2022 and 
2023, respectively), 
and the inclusion 
of Puerto 
Rico in 
the Earned 
Income Tax 
Credit and 
 the Child Tax Credit 
since 2021. 

 The 
2022 
Fiscal 
Plan 
contains 
an 
updated 
macroeconomic 
forecast 
that 
reflects 
the 
adverse 
impact 
of 
the 
pandemic-induced 
 recession at 
the end of 
fiscal year 
2020, followed 
by a 
forecasted rebound 
and recovery 
in fiscal years 
2021 through 
2023. Similar 
to 
 the 
previous 
fiscal 
plan, 
the 
2022 
Fiscal 
Plan 
incorporates 
a 
real 
growth 
series 
that 
was 
adjusted 
for 
the 
short-term 
income 
effects 
 resulting from 
the extraordinary 
unemployment insurance 
and other pandemic 
-related direct transfer 
programs. Specifically, 
the 2022 
 Fiscal Plan 
estimates that 
Puerto Rico s 
GNP will 
grow by 
5.2 in 
fiscal year 
2022, followed 
by a 
0.6 growth 
in fiscal 
year 2023. 
 Excluding 
the 
effect 
on 
household 
income 
from 
the 
unprecedented 
pandemic-related 
federal 
government 
stimulus, 
the 
2022 
Fiscal 
 Plan estimates that real GNP growth would be 2.6 and 0.9 in fiscal years 
2022 and 2023, respectively. 
 Over the 
past few 
years, Puerto 
Rico has 
benefited from 
historical levels 
of federal 
support, creating 
new opportunities 
to address 
 high-priority needs. 
The 2022 
Fiscal Plan 
projects that 
approximately 84 
billion of 
disaster relief 
funding in 
total, from 
federal and 
 private sources, will be disbursed in the reconstruction process over a period 
of 18 years (2018 to 2035). 

 As of December 
31, 2022, the 
Corporation had 338.9 
million of direct 
exposure to the 
Puerto Rico government, 
its municipalities 
 and public corporations. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 
 183.4 million of the exposure consisted of loans and obligations 
of 
 municipalities in Puerto Rico 
that are supported by 
assigned property tax revenues 
and for which, in most 
cases, the good faith, 
credit, 
 and 
unlimited 
taxing 
power 
of 
the 
applicable 
municipality 
have 
been 
pledged 
to 
their 
repayment, 
and 
 114.0 
million 
of 
loans 
and 
 obligations which are supported by 
one or more specific sources of municipal 
revenues. The municipalities are required by 
law to levy 
 special property taxes 
in such amounts as 
are required for the 
payment of all of 
their respective general obligation 
bonds and notes. In 
 addition 
to 
municipalities, 
the 
total 
direct 
exposure 
also 
included 
 10.8 
million 
in 
loans 
to 
an 
affiliate 
of 
PREPA, 
 27.4 
million 
in 
 loans to 
an agency 
of the 
Puerto Rico 
central 
government, and 
obligations 
of the 
Puerto Rico 
government, 
specifically a 
residential 
 pass-through 
MBS 
issued 
by 
the 
PR 
Housing 
Finance 
Authority PRHFA ), 
at 
an 
amortized 
cost 
of 
 3.3 
million 
as 
part 
of 
its 
 available-for-sale debt securities portfolio (fair value of 2.2 million as of 
December 31, 2022). 
 In 
addition, 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
had 
 84.7 
million 
in 
exposure 
to 
residential 
mortgage 
loans 
that 
are 
 guaranteed 
by the 
PRHFA. 
Residential 
mortgage 
loans guaranteed 
by the 
PRHFA 
are 
secured 
by 
the underlying 
properties 
and 
the 
 guarantees serve to cover 
shortfalls in collateral in the event 
of a borrower default. 
The regulations adopted by 
the PRHFA 
require the 
 establishment of 
adequate reserves 
to guarantee 
the solvency 
of its 
mortgage loans 
insurance program 
As of 
June 30, 
2021, the 
most 
 recent date 
as of 
which information 
is available, 
the PRHFA 
had a 
liability of 
approximately 5 
million as 
an estimate 
of the 
losses 
 inherent in the portfolio. 
 As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
had 
 2.3 
billion 
of public 
sector 
deposits 
in 
Puerto 
Rico. 
Approximately 
24 
of 
the 
 public sector deposits as of 
December 31, 2022 was from municipalities 
and municipal agencies in Puerto 
Rico and 76 was from 
the 
 public corporation, the Puerto Rico central government and agencies, and 
U.S. federal government agencies in Puerto Rico. 
 Instability in economic conditions, 
delays in the receipt of 
disaster relief funds allocated 
to Puerto Rico, and 
the potential impact on 
 asset 
values 
resulting 
from 
past 
or 
future 
natural 
disaster 
events, 
when 
added 
to 
Puerto 
Rico s 
ongoing 
fiscal 
challenges, 
could 
 materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, 
results of operations and capital position.

 A 
deterioration 
in 
economic 
conditions 
in 
the 
U.S. 
Virgin 
Islands 
and 
British 
Virgin 
Islands 
could 
harm 
our 
results 
of 
 operations. 

 For 
many 
years, 
the 
USVI 
has 
been 
experiencing 
a 
number 
of 
fiscal 
and 
economic 
challenges 
that 
have 
deteriorated 
the 
overall 
 financial 
and 
economic 
conditions 
in 
the 
area. 
On 
March 
4, 
2022, 
the 
United 
States 
Bureau 
of 
Economic 
Analysis 
(the 
 BEA 
 released 
its 
estimates 
of 
gross 
domestic 
product GDP 
for 
2020. 
According 
to 
the 
BEA, 
the 
USVI s 
real 
GDP 
decreased 
2.2 . 
 Also, the 
BEA revised 
its previously 
published 
real GDP 
growth 
estimate for 
2019 from 
2.2 
to 2.8 . 
According 
to the 
BEA, the 
 decline in real 
GDP for 2020 
reflected decreases 
in exports 
of services, private 
fixed investment, 
personal consumption 
expenditures, 
 and 
government 
spending 
primarily 
as a 
result 
of the 
effects 
of 
the COVID-19 
pandemic. 
These decreases 
were partly 
offset 
by an 
 increase in 
private inventory 
investment, reflecting 
an increase 
in crude 
oil and 
other petroleum 
products imported 
and stored 
in the 
 islands. In 
addition, there 
were reductions 
in imports 
of goods 
including consumer 
goods and 
equipment, and 
in imports 
of services. 
 According 
to the 
BEA, expenditures 
funded by 
the various 
federal grants 
and transfer 
payments are 
reflected in 
the GDP 
estimates; 
 however, 
the full 
effects 
of the 
pandemic 
cannot be 
quantified in 
the GDP 
statistics for 
the USVI 
because the 
impacts are 
generally 
 embedded in source data and cannot be separately identified. 

 Nonetheless, 
over 
the 
past 
two 
years, 
the 
USVI 
has 
been 
recovering 
from 
the 
adverse 
impact 
caused 
by 
COVID-19 
and 
has 
 continued to make progress 
on its rebuilding efforts 
related to Hurricanes Irma 
and Maria in 2017. 
According to data published 
by the 
 government, 
over 
 1.4 
billion 
in 
disaster 
recovery 
funds 
were 
disbursed 
during 
2021 
and 
2022, 
up 22 
from 
the 
preceding 
2-year 
 period. On the fiscal front, revenues have trended positively 
and the USVI Government successfully completed the 
restructuring of the 
 government employee 
retirement system. Although 
no official 
GDP data has 
been released 
for 2021 
and/or 2022, the 
aforementioned 
 developments, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
positive 
trend 
reflected 
by 
key 
economic 
indicators 
such 
as 
visitor 
arrivals, 
non-farm 
payrolls 
and 
 unemployment rate potentially indicate that the territory has experienced 
an overall economic recovery since 2020. 

PROMESA 
does 
not 
apply 
to the 
USVI 
and, 
as such, 
there 
is currently 
no federal 
legislation 
permitting 
the restructuring 
of 
the 
 debts of 
the USVI 
and 
its public 
corporations 
and instrumentalities. 
To 
the extent 
that the 
fiscal condition 
of the 
USVI government 
 continues to 
deteriorate, the 
U.S. Congress 
or the government 
of the 
USVI may enact 
legislation allowing 
for the restructuring 
of the 
 financial 
obligations 
of 
the 
USVI 
government 
entities 
or 
imposing 
a 
stay 
on 
creditor 
remedies, 
including 
by 
making 
PROMESA 
 applicable to the USVI. 

 As of 
December 31, 
2022, the 
Corporation had 
 38.0 million 
in loans 
to USVI 
government and 
public corporations, 
compared to 
 39.2 million as of December 31, 
2021. As of December 31, 2022, 
all loans were currently performing 
and up to date on principal 
and 
 interest payments. 

 A 
deterioration 
in 
economic 
conditions 
in 
USVI 
and 
the 
BVI 
region 
could 
adversely 
affect 
our 
business, 
financial 
condition, 
 liquidity, results of operations 
and capital position. 
 We are subject to ESG risks that 
could adversely affect our reputation and the market price of our securities. 
 The 
Corporation 
is 
subject 
to 
a 
variety 
of 
risks 
arising 
from ESG matters. ESG matters 
include 
climate 
risk, 
hiring 
practices, 
the 
 diversity 
of our 
work force, 
and racial 
and 
social justice 
issues involving 
our personnel, 
customers 
and 
third 
parties with 
whom 
we 
 otherwise do 
business. Risks arising 
from ESG matters may 
adversely affect, 
among other things, 
our reputation 
and the market 
price 
 of our securities. 
 For 
example, 
we 
may 
be 
exposed 
to 
negative 
publicity 
based 
on 
the 
identity 
and 
activities 
of 
those 
to 
whom 
we 
lend 
and 
with 
 which we 
otherwise do 
business and 
the public s 
view of 
the approach 
and performance 
of our 
customers and 
business partners 
with 
 respect 
to ESG matters. 
Any 
such 
negative 
publicity 
could 
arise 
from 
adverse 
news 
coverage 
in 
traditional 
media 
and 
could 
also 
 spread 
through 
the 
use 
of 
social 
media 
platforms. 
The 
Corporation s 
relationships 
and 
reputation 
with 
its 
existing 
and 
prospective 
 customers 
and 
third 
parties 
with 
which 
we 
do 
business 
could 
be 
damaged 
if 
we 
were 
to 
become 
the 
subject 
of 
any 
such 
negative 
 publicity. This, 
in turn, 
could have 
an adverse 
effect 
on 
our ability 
to 
attract 
and retain 
customers 
and 
employees 
and could 
have 
a 
 negative impact on our business, financial condition 
and results of operations. 
 Additionally, 
concerns over 
the long-term 
impacts of 
climate change 
have led 
and will 
continue to 
lead to 
governmental efforts 
to 
 mitigate 
those 
impacts. 
Consumers 
and 
businesses 
also 
may 
change 
their 
behavior 
on 
their 
own 
as 
a 
result 
of 
these 
concerns. 
The 
 Corporation 
and 
its 
customers 
will 
need 
to 
respond 
to 
new 
laws 
and 
regulations 
as 
well 
as 
consumer 
and 
business 
preferences 
 resulting from climate change concerns. 
 Finally, 
regulatory 
authorities, 
shareholders, 
customers 
and 
other 
stakeholders 
are 
considering 
how 
corporations 
are 
addressing 
 ESG 
issues. 
Regulations 
already 
adopted 
or 
being 
considered 
may 
expand 
mandatory 
and 
voluntary 
reporting, 
diligence 
and 
 disclosure on specific ESG topics, such as greenhouse gas 
emissions and other climate matters. These requirements 
would likely result 
 in 
increased ESG related 
compliance 
costs, 
which 
could 
result 
in 
increases 
to 
our 
overall 
operational 
costs. 
Failure 
to 
adapt 
to 
or 

26 
 comply 
with 
regulatory 
requirements 
or 
investor 
or 
stakeholder 
expectations 
and 
standards 
could 
negatively 
impact 
our 
reputation, 
 ability to do business with certain partners, and our stock price. 

 Our 
results 
of 
operations 
could 
be 
adversely 
affected 
by 
natural 
disasters, 
political 
crises, 
negative 
global 
climate 
patterns 
or 
 other catastrophic events.
 Natural 
disasters, which 
nature and 
severity may 
be impacted 
by climate 
change, 
such as 
hurricanes, 
floods, extreme 
cold 
events 
 and 
other 
adverse 
weather 
conditions; 
political 
crises, 
such 
as 
terrorist 
attacks, 
war, 
labor 
unrest, 
other 
political 
instability, 
trade 
 policies 
and 
sanctions, 
including 
the 
repercussions 
of 
the 
ongoing 
conflict 
between 
Russia 
and 
Ukraine; 
negative 
global 
climate 
 patterns, especially 
in water 
stressed regions; 
or other 
catastrophic events, 
such as 
fires or 
other disasters 
occurring at 
our locations, 
 whether occurring in 
Puerto Rico, the U.S., or 
internationally, 
could cause a significant 
adverse effect on the 
economy and disrupt our 
 operations. 
Certain areas 
in which 
our business 
is concentrated, 
including 
Puerto 
Rico and 
the USVI, 
are particularly 
susceptible 
to 
 earthquakes, hurricanes, 
and major 
storms. Further, 
climate change 
may increase 
both the 
frequency and 
severity of 
extreme weather 
 conditions 
and 
natural 
disasters, 
which 
may 
affect 
our 
business 
operations, 
either 
in 
a 
particular 
region 
or 
globally, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
 activities of our 
customers. The Corporation 
is also not 
able to predict 
the positive or 
negative effects 
that future events 
or changes to 
 the U.S. or global economy, 
financial markets, or regulatory and business environment could have on 
our operations. 
 Climate change may materially 
adversely affect the Corporation's business and results of operations. 
 Concerns over 
the long-term effects 
of climate change 
have led and 
will continue to 
lead to governmental 
efforts around 
the world 
 to 
mitigate 
those 
impacts. 
Consumers 
and 
businesses 
also 
may 
voluntarily 
change 
their behavior 
as a 
result 
of 
these 
concerns. 
The 
 Corporation 
and 
its 
customers 
will 
need 
to 
respond 
to 
new 
laws 
and 
regulations 
as 
well 
as 
consumer 
and 
business 
preferences 
 resulting 
from 
climate 
change 
concerns. 
The 
Corporation 
and 
its 
customers 
may 
face 
cost 
increases, 
asset 
value 
reductions 
and 
 operating process 
changes. The 
impact on 
our customers 
will likely 
vary depending 
on their 
specific attributes, 
including reliance 
on 
 or role in fossil fuel activities. Among the impacts to the Corporation, we could 
face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some 
 customers 
or in 
the value 
of assets 
securing 
loans. The 
Corporation s 
efforts 
to take 
these risks 
into account 
in making 
lending and 
 other 
decisions, 
including 
increasing 
our 
business 
with 
climate-responsible 
companies, 
may 
not 
be 
effective 
in 
protecting 
the 
 Corporation from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in 
consumer or business behavior. 
 Deterioration in collateral values may result in additional losses. 

 Our business is affected by the value of the assets securing our loans or underlying 
our investments. 

 We 
had a 
commercial and 
construction loan 
portfolio held 
for investment 
in the 
amount of 
 5.4 billion 
as of 
December 31, 
2022. 
 Due to 
their nature, 
these loans 
entail a 
higher credit 
risk than 
consumer and 
residential mortgage 
loans, since 
they are larger 
in size, 
 concentrate 
more 
risk 
in 
a 
single 
borrower 
and 
are 
generally 
more 
sensitive 
to 
economic 
downturns. 
Furthermore, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
 slowdown 
in the 
real estate 
market, 
it may 
be difficult 
to dispose 
of the 
properties 
securing 
these loans 
upon any 
foreclosure of 
the 
 properties. We 
may incur losses over the near term, either because of continued 
deterioration in the quality of loans or because of sales 
 of 
problem 
loans, 
which 
would 
likely 
accelerate 
the 
recognition 
of 
losses. Any 
such 
losses 
could 
adversely 
impact 
our 
overall 
 financial performance and results of operations. 
 Deterioration 
of the 
value of 
real estate 
collateral securing 
our construction, 
commercial and 
residential mortgage 
loan portfolios, 
 whether 
located in 
Puerto Rico 
or elsewhere, 
would result 
in increased 
credit losses. As 
of December 
31, 2022, 
approximately 
20 
 and 25 of our loan portfolio held for investment consisted of commercial 
mortgage and residential real estate loans, respectively. 
 Whether the collateral 
that underlies our 
loans is located 
in Puerto Rico, the 
USVI, the BVI, or 
the U.S. mainland, 
the performance 
 of our 
loan portfolio 
and the 
collateral value 
backing the 
transactions are 
dependent upon 
the performance 
of, and 
conditions within, 
 each 
specific 
real 
estate 
market. 
As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
our 
commercial 
mortgage 
and 
construction 
real 
estate 
loans 
held 
for 
 investment in 
the Puerto 
Rico and 
Virgin 
Islands regions 
and Florida 
region amounted 
to 1.9 
billion and 
 0.6 billion, 
respectively, 
 which constituted 22 of the total loan portfolio held for investment. 

 We 
measure credit 
losses for 
collateral dependent 
loans based 
on the 
fair value 
of the 
collateral, which 
is generally 
obtained from 
 appraisals, adjusted 
for undiscounted 
selling costs 
as appropriate. 
Updated appraisals 
are obtained 
when we 
determine that 
loans are 
 collateral 
dependent 
and 
are 
updated 
annually 
thereafter. 
In 
addition, 
appraisals 
are 
also 
obtained 
for 
certain 
residential 
mortgage 
 loans on a spot 
basis based on specific 
characteristics, such as delinquency 
levels, and age of 
the appraisal. The appraised 
value of the 
 collateral may decrease, or we may 
not be able to recover collateral at 
its appraised value. A significant decline 
in collateral valuations 
 for 
collateral 
dependent 
loans 
has 
required 
and, 
in 
the 
future, 
may 
require, 
increases 
in 
our 
credit 
loss 
expense 
on 
loans. Any 
such 
 increase would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition 
and results of operations. 

27 
 Labor shortages and constraints in the supply chain could adversely affect 
our clients operations as well as our operations. 
 Many 
sectors in 
Puerto 
Rico, the 
United 
States, the 
Virgin 
Islands and 
around 
the world 
are experiencing 
a shortage 
of workers. 
 Many of our commercial clients have 
been impacted by this shortage along with 
disruptions and constraints in the supply 
chain, which 
 could 
adversely 
impact 
their 
operations 
and 
could 
lead 
to 
reduced 
cash 
flow 
and 
difficulty 
in 
making 
loan 
repayments. 
The 
 Corporation s 
industry 
has 
also 
been 
affected 
by 
the 
shortage 
of 
workers, 
as 
well 
as 
increasing 
wages 
for 
entry 
level 
and 
certain 
 professional roles. This may 
lead to open positions remaining 
unfilled for longer periods of time, 
which may affect the level of 
service 
 provided by the Corporation, or a need to increase wages to attract workers. 

 The failure of other financial institutions could adversely affect 
us. 
 Our ability to engage in 
routine financing transactions could 
be adversely affected 
by future failures of financial 
institutions and the 
 actions and 
commercial 
soundness of 
other financial 
institutions. Financial 
institutions are 
interrelated as 
a result of 
trading, clearing, 
 counterparty 
and 
other relationships. 
We 
have 
exposure 
to different 
industries 
and 
counterparties 
and 
routinely 
execute 
transactions 
 with counterparties 
in the financial 
services industry, 
including brokers 
and dealers, 
commercial banks, 
investment banks, 
investment 
 companies and other 
institutional clients. In 
certain of these transactions, 
we are required to 
post collateral to secure 
the obligations to 
 the 
counterparties. 
In the 
event 
of 
a bankruptcy 
or 
insolvency 
proceeding 
involving 
one of 
such counterparties, 
we 
may 
experience 
 delays in recovering 
the assets posted as 
collateral, or we 
may incur a 
loss to the extent 
that the counterparty 
was holding collateral 
in 
 excess of the obligation to such counterparty or under other circumstances. 
 In addition, many of these transactions 
expose us to credit risk in 
the event of a default by our 
counterparty or client. The credit 
risk 
 may be exacerbated when 
the collateral held by us cannot 
be realized or is liquidated 
at prices not sufficient 
to recover the full amount 
 of the loan 
or derivative 
exposure due to 
us. Any losses 
resulting from 
our routine funding 
transactions may 
materially and adversely 
 affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 RISKS RELATING TO 
THE CORPORATION S 
BUSINESS 
 Certain funding sources may not be available to us and our funding sources may 
prove insufficient and/or costly to replace. 

 FirstBank 
relies 
primarily 
on 
customer 
deposits, 
the 
issuance 
of 
brokered 
CDs, 
and 
advances 
from 
the 
FHLB 
of 
New 
York 
to 
 maintain its lending 
activities and to replace 
certain maturing liabilities. 
As of December 31, 
2022, we had 105.8 
million in brokered 
 CDs outstanding, 
representing approximately 
1 of our 
total deposits. Approximately 
 55.7 million, or 
53 in brokered 
CDs mature 
 over the twelve months 
ending December 31, 2023, and 
the average remaining term to 
maturity of the brokered CDs outstanding 
as of 
 December 31, 2022 was approximately 1.6 
years. None of these brokered CDs are callable at the Corporation s 
option. In addition, the 
 Corporation had 
 675 million 
of FHLB 
advances outstanding 
as of 
December 31, 
2022, of 
which 475.0 
million are 
short-term and 
 are scheduled 
to mature 
within the 
next three 
months and 
 200 million 
are long-term 
and are 
scheduled to 
mature over 
three to 
five 
 years. 

 Although FirstBank has historically been 
able to replace maturing deposits and 
advances, we may not be able 
to replace these funds 
 in the future if our financial condition or general 
market conditions change. If we are unable to maintain access to funding 
sources, our 
 results of operations and liquidity would be adversely affected. 
 Alternate 
sources 
of 
funding 
may 
carry 
higher 
costs 
than 
sources 
currently 
utilized. 
If 
we 
are 
required 
to 
rely 
heavily 
on 
more 
 expensive funding sources, profitability would be adversely affected. 

 We 
may 
determine 
to 
seek 
debt 
financing 
in 
the 
future 
to 
achieve 
our 
long-term 
business 
objectives. 
Additional 
borrowings, 
if 
 sought, may not be available to us, or if available, may 
not be on acceptable terms. The availability of additional 
financing will depend 
 on 
a 
variety 
of 
factors, 
such 
as 
market 
conditions, 
the 
general 
availability 
of 
credit, 
our 
credit 
ratings 
and 
our 
credit 
capacity. 
The 
 recent rising interest 
rate environment has 
and may continue 
to increase the 
borrowing costs associated 
with any additional 
financing. 
 In addition, FirstBank 
may seek to sell 
loans as an additional 
source of liquidity. 
If additional financing 
sources are unavailable or 
are 
 not available on acceptable terms, our profitability and future prospects could 
be adversely affected. 
 Downgrades in our credit ratings could further increase the cost of borrowing 
funds. 
 The 
Corporation s 
ability to 
access new 
non-deposit 
sources of 
funding 
could be 
adversely 
affected 
by downgrades 
in our 
credit 
 ratings. The Corporation s 
liquidity is to a 
certain extent contingent upon 
its ability to obtain 
external sources of funding 
to finance its 
 operations. The 
Corporation s 
current credit 
ratings and 
any downgrades 
in such 
credit ratings 
can hinder 
the Corporation s 
access to 
 new 
forms 
of 
external 
funding 
and/or 
cause 
external 
funding 
to 
be 
more 
expensive, 
which 
could 
in 
turn 
adversely 
affect 
results 
of 
 operations. 

28 
 We depend on 
cash dividends from FirstBank to meet our cash obligations. 
 As a holding company, 
dividends from FirstBank, our banking subsidiary, 
have provided a substantial portion of our cash flow used 
 to 
service 
the 
interest 
payments 
on 
our 
TRuPs 
and 
other 
obligations. 
FirstBank 
is 
limited 
by 
law 
in 
its 
ability 
to 
make 
dividend 
 payments 
and other 
distributions 
to us 
based 
on its 
earnings and 
capital position. 
A failure 
by 
FirstBank 
to generate 
sufficient 
cash 
 flow to make dividend payments to us may have a negative impact on our results of 
operations and financial condition. 

 Our level of non-performing assets may adversely affect our future results of 
operations. 

 Non-performing 
assets decreased 
by 28.9 
million to 
 129.2 million 
as of 
December 31, 
2022, or 
18 , from 
 158.1 million 
as of 
 December 31, 
2021. As of 
December 31, 2022, 
we continued to 
have a relevant 
amount of nonaccrual 
loans, even though 
nonaccrual 
 loans decreased 
by 20.8 
million to 
 89.9 million 
as of 
December 31, 
2022, or 
19 , from 
 110.7 
million as 
of December 
31, 2021. 
 Our 
nonaccrual 
loans represent 
approximately 
1 of 
our 11.6 
billion 
loan 
portfolio 
as of 
December 31, 
2022. 
If we 
are unable 
to 
 effectively maintain the quality 
of our loan portfolio, our financial 
condition and results of operations 
may be materially and adversely 
 affected. 
 Our allowance for credit losses ACL may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and 
we may be required to materially 
 increase our ACL, which may adversely affect our capital 
ratios, financial condition and results of operations. 

 We are subject, among 
other things, to the risk of loss from loan defaults and 
foreclosures with respect to the loans we originate and 
 purchase. We 
recognize periodic 
credit loss 
expenses on 
loans, which 
leads to 
reductions in 
our income 
from operations, 
in order 
to 
 maintain 
our ACL 
on loans 
at a 
level that 
our management 
deems to 
be appropriate 
based upon 
an assessment 
of the 
quality 
of the 
 loan and lease portfolios. 
Management may fail to 
accurately estimate the level of 
credit losses or may 
have to increase our 
credit loss 
 expense 
on 
loans in 
the 
future as 
a 
result 
of 
new 
information 
regarding 
existing 
loans, 
future 
increases 
in 
nonaccrual 
loans 
beyond 
 what 
was 
forecasted, 
foreclosure 
actions 
and 
loan 
modifications, 
changes 
in 
current 
and 
expected 
economic 
and 
other 
conditions 
 affecting 
borrowers 
or 
for 
other 
reasons 
beyond 
our 
control. 
In 
addition, 
the 
bank 
regulatory 
agencies 
periodically 
review 
the 
 adequacy 
of 
our 
ACL 
on 
loans 
and 
may 
require 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
credit 
loss 
expense 
on 
loans 
or 
the 
recognition 
of 
additional 
 classified loans and loan charge-offs, based on 
judgments that differ from those of management. 

 The level 
of the 
ACL reflects 
management s 
estimates based 
upon various 
assumptions and 
judgments as 
to specific 
credit risks; 
 evaluation of 
industry concentrations; 
loan loss 
experience; current 
loan portfolio 
quality; present 
economic, political 
and regulatory 
 conditions; 
unidentified 
losses inherent 
in the 
current 
loan portfolio 
and reasonable 
and supportable 
forecasts. The 
determination 
of 
 the 
appropriate 
level 
of 
the 
ACL 
on 
loans 
inherently 
involves 
a 
high 
degree 
of 
subjectivity 
and 
requires 
management 
to 
make 
 significant estimates and judgments 
regarding current credit risks 
and future trends, all 
of which may undergo 
material changes. If our 
 estimates 
prove 
to 
be 
incorrect, 
our 
ACL 
on 
loans 
may 
not 
be 
sufficient 
to 
cover 
losses 
in 
our 
loan 
portfolio 
and 
our 
credit 
loss 
 expense on loans could increase substantially. 

 In addition, any increases in our credit loss expense on 
loans or any loan losses in excess of our ACL on loans could have a material 
 adverse effect on our future capital ratios, financial condition 
and results of operations. 

 The Corporation s force-placed 
insurance policies could be disputed by the customer. 
 The Corporation 
maintains force-placed 
insurance policies 
that have 
been put 
into place 
when a 
borrower s 
insurance policy 
on a 
 property has been canceled, 
lapsed or was deemed 
insufficient and the 
borrower did not 
secure a replacement policy. 
A borrower may 
 make 
a claim 
against the 
Corporation 
under 
such force 
-placed insurance 
policy and 
the failure 
of the 
Corporation 
to resolve 
such a 
 claim 
to 
the 
borrower s 
satisfaction 
may 
result 
in 
a 
dispute 
between 
the 
borrower 
and 
the 
Corporation, 
which 
if 
not 
adequately 
 resolved, could have an adverse effect on the Corporation. 
 Defective and repurchased loans may harm our business and financial condition. 

 In 
connection 
with 
the 
sale 
and 
securitization 
of 
loans, 
we 
are 
required 
to 
make 
a 
variety 
of 
customary 
representations 
and 
 warranties relating 
to the 
loans sold 
or securitized. 
Our obligations 
with respect 
to these 
representations and 
warranties are 
generally 
 outstanding 
for 
the 
life 
of 
the 
loan, 
and 
relate 
to, 
among 
other 
things, 
the 
following: 
(i) 
compliance 
with 
laws 
and 
regulations; 
(ii) 
 underwriting 
standards; 
(iii) 
the 
accuracy 
of 
information 
in 
the 
loan 
documents 
and 
loan 
files; 
and 
(iv) 
the 
characteristics 
and 
 enforceability of the loan. 
 A loan that 
does not comply 
with the representations 
and warranties made 
may take longer 
to sell, may impact 
our ability to obtain 
 third-party 
financing 
for 
the 
loan, 
and 
may 
not 
be 
saleable 
or 
may 
be 
saleable 
only 
at 
a 
significant 
discount. 
If 
such a 
loan 
is 
sold 
 before 
we 
detect 
non-compliance, 
we 
may 
be 
obligated 
to repurchase 
the 
loan 
and 
bear 
any 
associated 
loss directly, 
or 
we 
may 
be 
 obligated 
to 
indemnify 
the purchaser 
against 
any 
loss, 
either 
of 
which 
could 
reduce 
our cash 
available 
for 
operations 
and 
liquidity. 

29 
 Management 
believes 
that 
it has 
established 
controls 
to 
ensure 
that 
loans 
are 
originated 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
secondary 
market s 
 requirements, but certain employees may make mistakes or may deliberately 
violate our lending policies. 
 Our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, our risk management 
policies and procedures may be inadequate and 
 operational risks could adversely affect our consolidated 
results of operations. 

 We 
may fail 
to identify 
and manage 
risks related 
to a 
variety of 
aspects of 
our business, 
including, but 
not limited 
to, operational 
 risk, 
interest 
rate 
risk, 
trading 
risk, 
fiduciary 
risk, 
legal 
and 
compliance 
risk, 
liquidity 
risk 
and 
credit 
risk. 
We 
have 
adopted 
and 
 periodically 
improve 
various 
controls, 
procedures, 
policies 
and 
systems 
to 
monitor 
and 
manage 
risk. 
Any 
improvements 
to 
our 
 controls, procedures, 
policies and 
systems, however, 
may not 
be adequate 
to identify 
and manage 
the risks in 
our various 
businesses. 
 If our 
risk framework 
is ineffective, 
either because 
it fails to 
keep pace 
with changes in 
the financial 
markets or 
our businesses or 
for 
 other 
reasons, 
we 
could 
incur 
losses, 
suffer 
reputational 
damage, 
or 
find 
ourselves 
out 
of 
compliance 
with 
applicable 
regulatory 
 mandates or expectations. 

 We may also be 
subject to disruptions from external events, such as natural disasters and 
cyber-attacks, which could cause delays or 
 disruptions 
to 
operational 
functions, 
including 
information 
processing 
and 
financial 
market 
settlement 
functions. 
In 
addition, 
our 
 customers, 
vendors 
and 
counterparties 
could 
suffer 
from 
such 
events. 
Should 
these 
events 
affect 
us, 
or 
the 
customers, 
vendors 
or 
 counterparties with 
which we 
conduct business, 
our consolidated 
results of 
operations could 
be negatively 
affected. When 
we record 
 balance 
sheet 
reserves 
for 
probable 
loss 
contingencies 
related 
to 
operational 
losses, 
we 
may 
be 
unable 
to 
accurately 
estimate 
our 
 potential 
exposure, 
and 
any 
reserves 
we 
establish 
to 
cover 
operational 
losses 
may 
not 
be 
sufficient 
to 
cover 
our 
actual 
financial 
 exposure, which 
may have 
a material 
impact on 
our consolidated 
results of 
operations or 
financial condition 
for the 
periods in 
which 
 we recognize the losses. 
 Our failure to attract and retain a qualified workforce could harm our overall business 
and results of operations. 

 The Corporation s 
success depends, 
in large 
part, on its 
ability to attract 
and retain 
skilled, experienced personnel. 
Competition for 
 qualified 
candidates 
in 
the 
activities 
and 
markets 
that 
the 
Corporation 
and 
FirstBank 
serves 
is 
intense, 
and 
while 
the 
Corporation 
 invests significantly 
in the training 
and development of 
its employees, 
it may not 
be able to 
hire people or 
to retain them. 
In addition, 
 high inflation 
has impacted 
both cost 
structure and 
employee demand 
for wage 
growth, which 
may lead 
to sustained 
higher turnover 
 rates. 
If 
the 
Corporation 
is 
unable 
to 
retain 
its 
most 
qualified 
employees, 
its 
performance 
and 
competitive 
positioning 
could 
be 
 materially adversely affected. 
 Our businesses may be adversely affected by litigation. 
 We 
have, in 
the past, 
been party 
to claims 
and legal 
actions by 
our customers, 
or subject 
to regulatory 
supervisory actions 
by the 
 government on 
behalf of 
customers, relating 
to our 
performance of 
fiduciary or 
contractual responsibilities. 
In the 
past, we 
have also 
 been 
subject 
to 
securities 
class 
action 
litigation 
by 
our 
shareholders 
and 
we 
have 
also 
faced 
employment 
lawsuits 
and 
other 
legal 
 claims. In 
any future 
claims or 
actions, demands 
for substantial 
monetary damages 
may be 
asserted against 
us, resulting 
in financial 
 liability 
or 
an 
adverse 
effect 
on 
our 
reputation 
among 
investors 
or 
on 
customer 
demand 
for 
our 
products 
and 
services. 
A 
securities 
 class 
action 
suit 
against 
us 
in 
the 
future 
could 
result 
in 
substantial 
costs, 
potential 
liabilities 
and 
the 
diversion 
of 
management s 
 attention 
and 
resources. 
We 
may 
be 
unable 
to 
accurately 
estimate 
our 
exposure 
to 
litigation 
risk 
when 
we 
record 
balance 
sheet 
 reserves for probable loss contingencies. 
As a result, reserves we establish to 
cover any settlements or judgments may 
not be sufficient 
 to 
cover 
our 
actual 
financial 
exposure, 
which 
has 
occurred 
in 
the 
past 
and 
may 
occur 
in 
the 
future, 
resulting 
in 
a 
material 
adverse 
 impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. 

 In 
the 
ordinary 
course 
of 
our 
business, 
we 
are 
also 
subject 
to 
various 
regulatory, 
governmental 
and 
law 
enforcement 
inquiries, 
 investigations and 
subpoenas. These 
may be 
directed generally 
to participants 
in the 
businesses in 
which we 
are involved 
or may 
be 
 specifically directed 
at us. In 
regulatory enforcement 
matters, claims for 
disgorgement, the 
imposition of penalties 
and the imposition 
 of other remedial sanctions are possible. 

 The resolution 
of legal 
actions or 
regulatory matters, 
when unfavorable, 
has had, 
and could 
in the 
future have, 
a material 
adverse 
 effect on our consolidated results of operations for 
the quarter in which such actions or matters are resolved or a reserve is established. 

 Our businesses may be negatively affected by adverse publicity or 
other reputational harm. 
 Our relationships 
with many of 
our customers 
are predicated upon 
our reputation 
as a fiduciary 
and a service 
provider that adheres 
 to 
the 
highest 
standards 
of 
ethics, 
service 
quality 
and 
regulatory 
compliance. 
Adverse 
publicity, 
regulatory 
actions, 
litigation, 
 operational failures, the failure to meet customer expectations and other 
issues with respect to one or more of our businesses, including 
 FirstBank as our banking 
subsidiary, could 
materially and adversely affect 
our reputation, or our ability 
to attract and retain customers 
 or obtain 
sources of 
funding for 
the same 
or other 
businesses. Preserving 
and enhancing 
our reputation 
also depends 
on maintaining 
 systems and procedures that 
address known risks and regulatory 
requirements, as well as our 
ability to identify and mitigate 
additional 

30 
 risks 
that 
arise 
due 
to 
changes 
in 
our 
businesses, 
the 
market 
places 
in 
which 
we 
operate, 
the 
regulatory 
environment 
and 
customer 
 expectations. 
If we 
fail to 
promptly address 
matters that 
bear on 
our reputation, 
our reputation 
may be 
materially adversely 
affected 
 and our business may suffer.
 Any impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets may adversely affect 
our operating results. 
 If our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we may be 
required to record a significant charge to earnings. 
 Goodwill is 
tested for 
impairment on 
an annual 
basis, and 
more frequently 
if events 
or circumstances 
lead management 
to believe 
 the values of 
goodwill may 
be impaired. 
Other intangible assets 
are amortized 
over the projected 
useful lives of 
the related intangible 
 asset, 
generally 
on 
a 
straight-line 
basis, 
and 
these 
assets 
are 
reviewed 
periodically 
for 
impairment 
when 
events 
or 
changes 
in 
 circumstances 
indicate 
that 
the 
fair 
value 
may 
not 
exceed 
their 
carrying 
amount. 
Factors 
that 
may 
be 
considered 
a 
change 
in 
 circumstances 
indicating 
that 
the 
carrying 
value 
of 
the 
goodwill 
or 
amortizable 
intangible 
assets 
may 
not 
be 
recoverable 
includes 
 reduced future 
cash flow estimates, 
decreases in the 
current market 
price of 
our common 
shares, negative 
information concerning 
the 
 terminal value of similarly situated insured depository institutions, and 
slower growth rates in the industry. 
 The goodwill 
annual impairment 
evaluation process 
includes a 
qualitative assessment 
of events 
and circumstances 
that may 
affect 
 the reporting unit's fair value 
to determine whether it was more 
likely than not that the fair 
value of any reporting unit was 
less than its 
 carrying amount, including goodwill. If the result of the 
qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than 
not that the carrying 
 value of 
goodwill exceeds 
its fair 
value, a 
quantitative analysis 
is made 
to determine 
the amount 
of goodwill 
impairment. Analyzing 
 goodwill 
includes 
consideration 
of 
various 
factors 
that 
continue 
to 
rapidly 
evolve 
and 
for 
which 
significant 
uncertainty 
remains, 
 including the 
pace of 
economic recovery 
from the 
ongoing impacts 
of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 
Further weakening 
in the 
economic 
 environment, such as decline in the performance 
of the reporting units or other factors, could cause the 
fair value of one or more of the 
 reporting 
units 
to 
fall 
below 
their 
carrying 
value, 
resulting 
in 
a 
goodwill 
impairment 
charge. 
Actual 
values 
may 
differ 
significantly 
 from this assessment. Such 
differences could result 
in future impairment of 
goodwill that would, 
in turn, negatively 
impact our results 
 of 
operations 
and 
the 
reporting 
unit 
to 
which 
the 
goodwill 
relates. 
During 
the 
fourth 
quarter 
of 
2022, 
management 
performed 
a 
 qualitative 
analysis 
of 
the 
carrying 
amount 
of 
goodwill, 
and 
concluded 
that 
it 
is 
more-likely-than-not 
that 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
the 
 reporting units exceeded their carrying value. Therefore, no quantitative 
analysis was required. 

 As of 
December 31, 
2022, the 
book value 
of our 
goodwill was 
 38.6 million, 
which was 
recorded at 
FirstBank. 
If an 
impairment 
 determination 
is 
made 
in 
a 
future 
reporting 
period, 
our 
earnings 
and 
book 
value 
of 
goodwill 
will 
be 
reduced 
by 
the 
amount 
of 
the 
 impairment. If an 
impairment loss is 
recorded, it will 
have little or 
no impact on 
the tangible book 
value of our 
common stock, or 
our 
 regulatory capital 
levels, but such 
an impairment 
loss could significantly 
reduce FirstBank s 
earnings and 
thereby restrict FirstBank s 
 ability to make dividend payments to us without prior 
regulatory approval, because Federal Reserve policy states 
that the bank holding 
 company dividends should be paid from current earnings. 

 Recognition of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable 
income by the Bank. 

 As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
had 
a 
deferred 
tax 
asset 
of 
 155.6 
million 
(net 
of 
a 
valuation 
allowance 
of 
 185.5 
 million, including 
a valuation 
allowance of 
 149.5 million 
against the 
deferred tax 
assets of 
FirstBank). Under 
the 2011 
PR Code, 
as 
 amended, the 
Corporation and 
its subsidiaries, 
including FirstBank, 
are treated 
as separate 
taxable entities 
and are 
not entitled 
to file 
 consolidated tax 
returns. Accordingly, 
in order to 
obtain a tax 
benefit from a 
net operating loss NOL ), a 
particular subsidiary 
must 
 be able to 
demonstrate sufficient 
taxable income 
within the applicable 
NOL carry-forward 
period. Pursuant 
to the 2011 
PR Code, the 
 carry-forward period 
for NOLs 
incurred during 
taxable years 
that commenced 
after December 
31, 2004 
and ended 
before January 
1, 
 2013 
is 
12 
years; 
for 
NOLs 
incurred 
during 
taxable 
years 
commencing 
after 
December 
31, 
2012, 
the 
carryover 
period 
is 
10 
years. 
 Accounting for 
income taxes 
requires that 
companies assess 
whether a 
valuation allowance 
should be 
recorded against 
their deferred 
 tax asset based 
on an assessment 
of the amount 
of the deferred 
tax asset that 
is more 
likely than 
not to be 
realized. Due to 
significant 
 estimates 
utilized 
in 
determining 
the valuation 
allowance 
and 
the potential 
for 
changes 
in facts 
and 
circumstances 
in 
the future, 
the 
 Corporation 
may 
not 
be 
able 
to 
reverse 
the 
remaining 
valuation 
allowance 
or 
may 
need 
to 
increase 
its 
current 
deferred 
tax 
asset 
 valuation allowance. 
 The Corporation s 
judgments regarding tax accounting 
policies and the resolution of 
tax disputes may impact the 
Corporation s 
 earnings and cash 
flow, and 
changes in the tax 
laws of multiple 
jurisdictions can materially 
affect our operations, 
tax obligations, 
 and effective tax rate. 

 Significant 
judgment 
is 
required 
in 
determining 
the 
Corporation s 
effective 
tax 
rate 
and 
in 
evaluating 
its 
tax 
positions. 
The 
 Corporation 
provides 
for 
uncertain 
tax 
positions 
when 
such 
tax 
positions 
do 
not 
meet 
the 
recognition 
thresholds 
or 
measurement 
 criteria prescribed by applicable GAAP. 

 Fluctuations in federal, 
state, local, and foreign 
taxes or a change 
to uncertain tax positions, 
including related interest 
and penalties, 
 may impact 
the Corporation s 
effective tax 
rate. When particular 
tax matters arise, 
a number 
of years may 
elapse before such 
matters 

31 
 are audited 
and finally 
resolved. In 
addition, 
the Puerto 
Rico Department 
of Treasury PRTD ), 
the U.S. 
Internal 
Revenue Service 
 IRS ), 
and 
the 
tax 
authorities 
in 
the 
jurisdictions 
in 
which 
we 
operate 
may 
challenge 
our 
tax 
positions 
and 
we 
may 
estimate 
and 
 provide 
for 
potential liabilities 
that may 
arise out 
of tax 
audits to 
the extent 
that uncertain 
tax positions 
fail to 
meet the 
recognition 
 standard under 
applicable GAAP. 
Unfavorable resolution 
of any 
tax matter 
could increase 
the effective 
tax rate 
and could 
result in 
a 
 material increase in our tax expense. Resolution of a tax issue may require 
the use of cash in the year of resolution. 
 First BanCorp. is subject 
to Puerto Rico income 
tax on its income 
from all sources. FirstBank 
is treated as a 
foreign corporation for 
 U.S. and USVI income 
tax purposes and is generally 
subject to U.S. and 
USVI income tax only 
on its income from 
sources within the 
 U.S. 
and 
USVI 
or 
income 
effectively 
connected 
with 
the 
conduct 
of 
a 
trade 
or 
business 
in 
those 
regions. 
The 
USVI 
jurisdiction 
 imposes 
income 
taxes 
based 
on 
the 
U.S. 
Internal 
Revenue 
Code 
under 
the 
 mirror 
system 
established 
by 
the 
Naval 
Service 
 Appropriations Act of 1922. However, 
the USVI jurisdiction also imposes an additional 10 surtax on the USVI tax liability, 
if any. 
 These 
tax 
laws 
are 
complex 
and 
subject 
to 
different 
interpretations. 
We 
must 
make 
judgments 
and 
interpretations 
about 
the 
 application 
of 
these 
inherently 
complex 
tax 
laws 
when 
determining 
our 
provision 
for 
income 
taxes, 
our 
deferred 
tax 
assets 
and 
 liabilities, and 
our valuation 
allowance. In 
addition, legislative 
changes, particularly 
changes in 
tax laws, 
could adversely 
impact our 
 results of operations. 
 Changes in applicable 
tax laws in 
Puerto Rico, the 
U.S., or other 
jurisdictions or tax 
authorities new interpretations 
could result in 
 increases in our overall taxes and the Corporation s 
financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted. 
 Our ability to use our NOL carryforwards may be limited.
 The Corporation 
has U.S. 
and USVI 
sourced NOL 
carryforwards. Section 
382 of 
the U.S. 
Internal Revenue 
Code Section 
382 
 limits the 
ability to 
utilize U.S. 
and USVI 
NOLs for income 
tax purposes, 
respectively, 
at such 
jurisdictions following 
an event 
of an 
 ownership 
change. Generally, 
an ownership 
change occurs 
when 
certain shareholders 
increase their 
aggregate ownership 
by more 
 than 50 percentage 
points over their 
lowest ownership percentage 
over a three-year 
testing period. Section 
1034.04(u) of the 
2011 PR 
 Code 
is 
significantly 
similar 
to 
Section 
382. 
However, 
Act 
60-2019 
amended 
the 
PR 
Code 
to 
repeal 
the 
corporate 
NOL 
carryover 
 limitations upon change in control for taxable years beginning after December 
31, 2018. 

 Upon the occurrence of a Section 382 ownership change, the use of 
NOLs attributable to the period prior to the ownership change is 
 subject 
to 
limitations 
and 
only 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
U.S. 
and 
USVI 
NOLs, 
as 
applicable, 
may 
be 
used 
by 
the 
Corporation 
to 
offset 
the 
 annual 
U.S. 
and 
USVI 
taxable 
income, 
if 
any. 
In 
2017, 
the 
Corporation 
completed 
a 
formal 
ownership 
change 
analysis 
within 
the 
 meaning of Section 382 covering a 
comprehensive period, and concluded that 
an ownership change, for U.S. and 
USVI purposes only, 
 had 
occurred 
during 
such 
period. 
The 
Section 
382 
limitation 
has 
resulted 
in 
higher 
U.S. 
and 
USVI 
income 
tax 
liabilities 
than 
we 
 would have incurred in the absence of such limitation. 

 It is possible that 
the utilization of our 
U.S. and USVI NOLs 
could be further limited 
due to future changes 
in our stock ownership, 
 as 
a 
result 
of 
either 
sales 
of 
our 
outstanding 
shares 
or 
issuances 
of 
new 
shares 
that 
could 
separately 
or 
cumulatively 
trigger 
an 
 ownership 
change 
and, 
consequently, 
a 
Section 
382 
limitation. 
Any 
further 
Section 
382 
limitations 
may 
result 
in 
greater 
U.S. 
and 
 USVI tax 
liabilities 
than 
we would 
incur 
in the 
absence 
of such 
a limitation 
and 
any 
increased liabilities 
could 
adversely affect 
our 
 earnings and cash 
flow. 
We 
may be able to 
mitigate the adverse 
effects associated with 
a Section 382 
limitation in the U.S. 
and USVI 
 to the extent that we could credit any resulting 
additional U.S. and USVI tax liability against our tax liability 
in Puerto Rico. However, 
 our 
ability 
to 
reduce 
our 
Puerto 
Rico 
tax 
liability 
through 
such 
a 
credit 
or 
deduction 
will 
depend 
on 
our 
tax 
profile 
at 
each 
annual 
 taxable period, which is dependent on various factors. 
 RISKS RELATING TO 
TECHNOLOGY AND CYBERSECURITY 

 We 
must respond 
to rapid 
technological changes, 
and these 
changes may 
be more 
difficult or 
expensive than 
anticipated. 
We 
 may also be negatively 
affected if we fail 
to identify and address 
operational risks associated 
with the introduction of 
or changes to 
 products and services. 
 Like 
most 
financial 
institutions, 
FirstBank 
significantly 
depends 
on 
technology 
to 
deliver 
its 
products 
and 
other 
services 
and 
to 
 otherwise conduct 
business. To 
remain technologically 
competitive and 
operationally efficient, 
FirstBank invests 
in system 
upgrades, 
 new 
technological 
solutions, 
and 
other 
technology 
initiatives. 
If 
competitors 
introduce 
new 
products 
and 
services 
embodying 
new 
 technologies, 
or if 
new industry 
standards and 
practices emerge, 
our existing 
product 
and service 
offerings, 
technology and 
systems 
 may become obsolete. 
Furthermore, if we fail 
to adopt or develop 
new technologies or 
to adapt our products 
and services to emerging 
 industry standards, 
we may 
lose current 
and future 
customers, which 
could have 
a material 
adverse effect 
on our 
business, financial 
 condition and 
results of 
operations. The 
financial services 
industry is 
changing rapidly 
and, in 
order to 
remain competitive, 
we must 
 continue 
to 
enhance 
and 
improve 
the 
functionality 
and 
features 
of 
our 
products, 
services 
and 
technologies. 
These 
changes 
may 
be 
 more difficult or expensive to implement than we anticipate. 

32 
 When 
we 
launch 
a 
new 
product 
or 
service, 
introduce 
a 
new 
platform 
for 
the 
delivery 
or 
distribution 
of 
products 
or 
services 
 (including mobile 
connectivity and 
cloud computing), 
or make changes 
to an existing 
product or service, 
we may not 
fully appreciate 
 or 
identify 
new operational 
risks that 
may 
arise 
from those 
changes, 
or 
we may 
fail 
to 
implement 
adequate 
controls 
to mitigate 
the 
 risks 
associated 
with 
those 
changes. 
Significant 
failure 
in 
this regard 
could 
diminish 
our ability 
to 
operate 
our 
business or 
result 
in 
 potential 
liability 
to 
our 
customers 
and 
third 
parties, 
increased 
operating 
expenses, 
weaker 
competitive 
standing, 
and 
significant 
 reputational, legal 
and regulatory 
costs. Any 
of the 
foregoing consequences 
could materially 
and adversely 
affect our 
businesses and 
 results of operations. 
 Our 
operational 
or 
security 
systems 
or 
infrastructure, 
or 
those 
of 
third 
parties, 
could 
fail 
or 
be 
breached. 
Any 
such 
future 
 incidents could 
potentially disrupt 
our business 
and adversely 
impact our 
results of 
operations, liquidity, 
and financial 
condition, 
 as well as cause legal or reputational harm.
 The potential 
for operational 
risk exposure 
exists throughout our 
business and, 
as a result 
of our 
interactions with, and 
reliance on, 
 third 
parties, 
is 
not 
limited 
to 
our 
own 
internal 
operational 
functions. 
Our 
operational 
and 
security 
systems 
and 
infrastructure, 
 including our computer systems, 
data management, and internal 
processes, as well as those 
of third parties that 
perform key aspects of 
 our 
business 
operations, 
such 
as 
data 
processing, 
information 
security, 
recording 
and 
monitoring 
transactions, 
online 
banking 
 interfaces and services, 
internet connections, and 
network access are 
integral to our 
performance. We 
rely on our 
employees and third 
 parties in 
our day-to-day 
and ongoing 
operations, 
who may, 
because of 
human error, 
misconduct, 
malfeasance, 
failure, or 
breach of 
 our or of third-party systems or infrastructure, expose us to risk. 

Our ability to 
implement backup systems 
and other safeguards 
with respect to 
third-party systems is more 
limited than with 
respect 
 to 
our 
own 
systems. 
In 
addition, 
our 
financial, 
accounting, 
data 
processing, 
backup, 
or 
other 
operating 
or 
security 
systems 
and 
 infrastructure may fail to 
operate properly or become 
disabled, damaged, or otherwise 
compromised as a result of 
a number of factors, 
 including 
events that 
are wholly 
or partially 
beyond our 
control. 
We 
may 
need to 
take our 
systems offline 
if they 
become infected 
 with malware or a computer 
virus or because of another form of 
cyberattack. If backup systems are utilized, 
they may not process data 
 as quickly as our primary 
systems and some data might 
not have been saved to backup 
systems, potentially resulting in a 
temporary or 
 permanent loss of such data. 

We 
frequently update 
our systems 
to support 
our operations 
and growth 
and to 
remain compliant 
with applicable 
laws, rules, 
and 
 regulations. In 
addition, we 
review and 
strengthen our 
security systems 
in response 
to any 
cyber incident. 
Such strengthening 
entails 
 significant 
costs 
and 
risks 
associated 
with 
implementing 
new 
systems 
and 
integrating 
them 
with 
existing 
ones, 
including 
potential 
 business interruptions and 
the risk that this 
strengthening may not 
be entirely effective. 
Implementation and testing 
of controls related 
 to 
our 
computer 
systems, 
security 
monitoring, 
and 
retaining 
and 
training 
personnel 
required 
to 
operate 
our 
systems 
also 
entail 
 significant costs. 
Such operational 
risk exposures 
could adversely 
impact our 
operations, liquidity, 
and financial 
condition, as 
well as 
 cause 
reputational 
harm. 
In 
addition, 
we 
may 
not 
have 
adequate 
insurance 
coverage 
to 
compensate 
for 
losses 
from 
a 
major 
 interruption. 
 Cyber-attacks, 
system 
risks 
and 
data 
protection 
breaches 
could 
adversely 
affect 
our 
ability 
to 
conduct 
business, 
manage 
our 
 exposure to risk or 
expand our business, result 
in the disclosure or 
misuse of confidential 
or proprietary information, 
increase our 
 costs to 
maintain and 
update our 
operational and 
security systems 
and infrastructure, 
and present 
significant reputational, 
legal 
 and regulatory costs
 .
 Our 
business 
is 
highly 
dependent 
on 
the 
security, 
controls 
and 
efficacy 
of 
our 
infrastructure, 
computer 
and 
data 
management 
 systems, 
as 
well 
as 
those 
of 
our 
customers, 
suppliers, 
and 
other 
third 
parties. 
To 
access 
our 
network, 
products 
and 
services, 
our 
 employees, 
customers, suppliers, 
and other 
third parties, 
including downstream 
service providers, 
the financial 
services industry 
and 
 financial 
data 
aggregators, 
with 
whom 
we 
interact, 
on 
whom 
we 
rely 
or 
who 
have 
access 
to 
our 
customers' 
personal 
or 
account 
 information, increasingly 
use personal mobile 
devices or computing 
devices that are 
outside of our 
network and control 
environments 
 and 
are 
subject 
to 
their 
own 
cybersecurity 
risks. 
Our 
business 
relies 
on 
effective 
access 
management 
and 
the 
secure 
collection, 
 processing, 
transmission, 
storage and 
retrieval 
of confidential, 
proprietary, 
personal and 
other 
information 
in our 
computer 
and data 
 management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management 
systems and networks of third parties. 

 Information 
security 
risks 
for 
financial 
institutions 
have 
significantly 
increased 
in 
recent 
years, 
especially 
given 
the 
increasing 
 sophistication and activities 
of organized 
computer criminals, hackers, 
and terrorists and 
our expansion of 
online and digital 
customer 
 services to 
better 
meet our 
customer s 
needs. 
These threats 
may 
derive 
from fraud 
or malice 
on the 
part of 
our employees 
or third-
 party 
providers 
or 
may 
result 
from 
human 
error 
or 
accidental 
technological 
failure. 
These 
threats 
include 
cyber-attacks, 
such 
as 
 computer viruses, 
malicious or 
destructive code, 
phishing attacks, 
denial of 
service attacks, or 
other security 
breach tactics 
that could 
 result 
in 
the 
unauthorized 
release, 
gathering, 
monitoring, 
misuse, 
loss, 
destruction, 
or 
theft 
of 
confidential, 
proprietary, 
and 
other 
 information, including 
intellectual property, 
of ours, our 
employees, our customers, 
or third parties, 
damages to systems, 
or otherwise 
 material 
disruption 
to 
our 
or 
our 
customers 
or 
other 
third 
parties 
network 
access 
or 
business 
operations, 
both 
domestically 
and 
 internationally.

Security 
Program 
that 
continuously 
monitors 
cyber-related 
risks 
and 
ultimately 
ensures 
 protection 
for 
the 
processing, 
transmission 
and 
storage 
of confidential, 
proprietary, 
and other 
information 
in our 
computer 
systems, 
 and networks as well as 
vendor management program 
to oversee third party and 
vendor risks, there is no 
guarantee that we will not 
be 
 exposed to or 
be affected 
by a cybersecurity 
incident. 
Cyber threats are 
rapidly changing and 
future attacks or 
breaches could lead 
to 
 other 
security 
breaches 
of 
the networks, 
systems, 
or 
devices 
that 
our 
customers 
use 
to 
access our 
integrated 
products 
and 
services, 
 which, 
in 
turn, 
could 
result 
in 
unauthorized 
disclosure, 
release, 
gathering, 
monitoring, 
misuse, 
loss 
or 
destruction 
of 
confidential, 
 proprietary, 
and 
other 
information 
(including 
account 
data 
information) 
or 
data 
security 
compromises. 
As 
cyber 
threats 
continue 
to 
 evolve, we 
may be required 
to expend significant 
additional resources to 
modify or enhance 
our protective measures, 
investigate, and 
 remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents and develop 
our capabilities to respond and recover. 
The full extent of a 
 particular cyberattack, 
and the 
steps that 
the Corporation 
may need 
to take 
to investigate 
such attack, 
may not 
be immediately 
clear, 
 and it 
could take 
considerable additional 
time for us 
to determine 
the complete 
scope of 
information compromised, 
at which time 
the 
 impact 
on the 
Corporation 
and measures 
to recover 
and restore 
to a 
business-as-usual 
state may 
be difficult 
to assess. 
These factors 
 may 
also 
inhibit 
our 
ability 
to 
provide 
full 
and 
reliable 
information 
about 
the 
cyberattack 
to 
our 
customers, 
third-party 
vendors, 
 regulators, and the public. 

 A successful penetration or circumvention of our system security, 
or the systems of our customers, suppliers, and other third parties, 
 could cause us serious negative consequences, including significant 
operational, reputational, legal, and regulatory costs and concerns. 

Any of these 
adverse consequences could 
adversely impact our 
results of operations, 
liquidity, 
and financial condition. 
In addition, 
 our 
insurance 
policies 
may 
not 
be 
adequate 
to 
compensate 
us 
for 
the 
potential 
costs 
and 
other 
losses 
arising 
from 
cyber-attacks, 
 failures of 
information technology 
systems, or 
security breaches, 
and such 
insurance policies 
may not 
be available 
to us in 
the future 
 on 
economically 
reasonable 
terms, or 
at 
all. 
Insurers 
may 
also 
deny 
us 
coverage 
as to 
any 
future 
claim. 
Any of 
these 
results 
could 
 harm our growth prospects, financial condition, business, and reputation. 
 The Corporation is subject 
to stringent and changing 
privacy laws, regulations, 
and standards as well 
as policies, contracts, and 
 other 
obligations 
related 
to 
data 
privacy 
and 
security. 
Our 
failure 
to 
comply 
with 
privacy 
laws and 
regulations, 
as 
well as 
other 
 legal obligations, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 State, 
federal, 
and 
foreign 
governments 
are 
increasingly 
enacting 
laws 
and 
regulations 
governing 
the 
collection, 
use, 
retention, 
 sharing, transfer, 
and security 
of personally 
identifiable information 
and data. 
A variety 
of federal, 
state, local, 
and foreign 
laws and 
 regulations, 
orders, 
rules, 
codes, 
regulatory 
guidance, 
and 
certain 
industry 
standards 
regarding 
privacy, 
data 
protection, 
consumer 
 protection, 
information 
security, 
and 
the 
processing 
of 
personal 
information 
and 
other 
data 
apply 
to 
our 
business. 
State 
laws 
are 
 changing 
rapidly, 
and 
new 
legislation 
proposed 
or 
enacted 
in 
a 
number 
of 
other 
states 
imposes, 
or 
has 
the 
potential 
to 
impose, 
 additional obligations 
on companies 
that process 
confidential, sensitive 
and personal 
information, and 
will continue 
to shape 
the data 
 privacy 
environment 
nationally. 
The 
U.S. 
federal 
government 
is 
also 
focused 
on 
privacy 
matters. 
Any 
failure 
by 
us 
or 
any 
of 
our 
 business 
partners 
to 
comply 
with 
applicable 
laws, 
rules, 
and 
regulations 
may 
result 
in 
investigations 
or 
actions 
against 
us 
by 
 governmental entities, private 
claims and litigation, fines, 
penalties or other liabilities. 
Such events may increase 
our expenses, expose 
 us to 
liabilities, and 
impair our reputation, 
which could have 
a material 
adverse effect 
on our business. 
While we 
aim to comply 
with 
 applicable data protection 
laws and obligations 
in all material 
respects, there 
is no assurance 
that we will 
not be subject 
to claims that 
 we 
have 
violated 
such 
laws 
and 
obligations, 
will 
be 
able 
to 
successfully 
defend 
against 
such 
claims, 
or 
will 
not 
be 
subject 
to 
 significant fines 
and penalties 
in the 
event of 
non-compliance. Additionally, 
to the 
extent multiple 
state-level laws 
are introduced 
in 
 the U.S. with 
inconsistent or conflicting 
standards and there 
is no federal 
law to preempt 
such laws, compliance 
with such laws 
could 
 be difficult and costly, 
or impossible, to achieve, and we could be subject to fines and penalties in the event 
of non-compliance. 
 RISK RELATING 
TO THE REGULATION 
OF OUR INDUSTRY

We are subject to certain regulatory 
restrictions that may adversely affect our operations. 
 We 
are subject 
to supervision 
and regulation 
by the 
Federal Reserve 
Board and 
the FDIC. 
We 
are a 
bank holding 
company and 
a 
 financial holding 
company under 
the Bank 
Holding Company 
Act of 
1956, as 
amended. The 
Bank is 
also subject 
to supervision 
and 
 regulation by OCIF. 
 Under 
federal 
law, 
financial 
holding 
companies 
are 
permitted 
to 
engage 
in 
a 
broader 
range 
of 
 financial 
activities 
than 
those 
 permitted 
to 
bank 
holding 
companies 
that 
are 
not 
financial 
holding 
companies. 
A 
financial 
holding 
company 
that 
ceases 
to 
meet 
 certain 
standards 
is 
subject 
to 
a 
variety 
of 
restrictions, 
depending 
on 
the 
circumstances, 
including 
the 
prohibition 
from 
undertaking 
 new activities 
or acquiring 
shares or 
control of 
other companies. 
If we 
fail to 
comply with 
the requirements 
from our 
regulators, 
we 
 may 
become 
subject 
to 
regulatory 
enforcement 
action 
and 
other 
adverse 
regulatory 
actions 
that 
might 
have 
a 
material 
and 
adverse 
 effect on our operations. 

 The FDIC insures 
deposits at 
FDIC-insured depository 
institutions up 
to certain limits 
(currently, 
 250,000 per depositor 
account). 
 The FDIC charges insured 
depository institutions premiums to 
maintain the DIF. 
In the event of a bank 
failure, the FDIC takes control 

34 
 of a failed 
bank and, if 
necessary, 
pays all insured 
deposits up to 
the statutory deposit 
insurance limits using 
the resources of 
the DIF. 
 The FDIC 
is required 
by law to 
maintain adequate 
funding of 
the DIF, 
and the 
FDIC may 
increase premium 
assessments to 
maintain 
 such 
funding. 
The 
Dodd-Frank 
Wall 
Street 
Reform 
and 
Consumer 
Protection 
Act 
(the 
 Dodd-Frank 
Act 
requires 
the 
FDIC 
to 
 increase the DIF s 
reserves against future losses, which 
will require institutions with assets 
greater than 10 billion, such as 
FirstBank, 
 to bear an increased responsibility for funding the prescribed reserve to support 
the DIF. 

 The FDIC 
may further 
increase FirstBank s 
premiums or 
impose additional 
assessments or 
prepayment requirements 
in the 
future. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act removed the statutory cap for the reserve ratio, leaving 
the FDIC free to set this cap going forward. 

 Our 
compensation 
practices 
are 
subject 
to 
oversight 
by 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
Board 
and 
the 
FDIC. 
Any 
deficiencies 
in 
our 
 compensation 
practices 
may 
be 
incorporated 
into 
our 
supervisory 
ratings, 
which 
can 
affect 
our 
ability 
to 
make 
acquisitions 
or 
 perform other actions. In addition, 
the regulation of our compensation practices has and may continue to change 
in the future. 
 Our 
compensation 
practices 
are subject 
to 
oversight 
by 
the Federal 
Reserve 
Board 
and 
the FDIC. 
As discussed 
in 
Item 
1 
of 
this 
 Annual Report 
on Form 10-K, 
the Corporation 
currently is subject 
to the interagency 
guidance governing 
the incentive compensation 
 activities of regulated 
banks and bank 
holding companies, 
and other financial 
regulators have also 
implemented regulations 
regarding 
 compensation 
practices. 
Our 
failure 
to 
satisfy 
these 
restrictions 
and 
guidelines 
could 
expose 
us 
to 
adverse 
regulatory 
criticism, 
 lowered supervisory ratings, and restrictions on our operations and acquisition activities. 

 The scope and 
content of the U.S. 
financial regulators policies 
on executive compensation 
are continuing to develop 
and are likely 
 to continue evolving in 
the future. It cannot be 
determined at this time whether 
compliance with such policies 
will adversely affect the 
 ability of the Corporation and its subsidiaries to hire, retain and motivate their key employees. 
 We 
are 
subject 
to 
regulatory 
capital 
adequacy 
guidelines, 
and, 
if 
we 
fail 
to 
meet 
these 
guidelines, 
our 
business 
and 
financial 
 condition will be adversely affected. 

 We 
are subject 
to stringent 
regulatory 
capital requirements. 
Although 
the Corporation 
and FirstBank 
met general 
well-capitalized 
 capital ratios 
as of 
December 31, 
2022, and 
we expect 
both companies 
will continue 
to exceed 
the minimum 
risk-based and 
leverage 
 capital 
ratio 
requirements 
for 
well-capitalized 
status 
under 
the 
current 
capital 
rules, 
we 
cannot 
assure 
that 
we 
will 
remain 
at 
such 
 levels. 
If 
we 
fail 
to 
meet 
these 
minimum 
capital 
guidelines 
and 
other 
regulatory 
requirements, 
our 
business 
and 
financial 
condition 
 will be materially and adversely affected. 
If we fail to maintain certain capital 
levels or are deemed not well managed under 
regulatory 
 exam procedures, 
or if we 
experience certain 
regulatory violations, 
our status as 
a financial 
holding company, 
and our ability 
to offer 
 certain financial products will be compromised and our financial condition and 
results of operations could be adversely affected. 

 Monetary 
policies 
and 
regulations 
of 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
Board 
could 
adversely 
affect 
our 
business, 
financial 
condition 
and 
 results of operations. 
 In addition 
to being 
affected 
by general 
economic conditions, 
our earnings 
and growth 
are affected 
by the 
policies of 
the Federal 
 Reserve Board. An important 
function of the Federal 
Reserve Board is to regulate 
the money supply and 
credit conditions. Among the 
 instruments 
used 
by 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
Board 
to 
implement 
these 
objectives 
are 
open 
market 
operations 
in 
U.S. 
government 
 securities, 
adjustments 
of 
the 
discount 
rate 
and 
changes 
in 
reserve 
requirements 
for 
bank 
deposits. 
These 
instruments 
are 
used 
in 
 varying combinations to 
influence overall economic 
growth and the 
distribution of credit, 
bank loans, investments 
and deposits. Their 
 use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid 
on deposits. 

 The monetary policies 
and regulations of 
the Federal Reserve Board, 
which during 2022 
included, but were not 
limited to, multiple 
 increases in 
the federal 
funds rate 
to reduce 
inflation, have 
had a 
significant effect 
on the 
operating results 
of commercial 
banks and 
 are 
expected 
to 
continue 
to 
do 
so 
in 
the 
future. 
The 
effects 
of 
such 
policies 
upon 
our 
business, 
financial 
condition 
and 
results 
of 
 operations have been and may continue to be adverse. 

 We 
are subject 
to numerous 
laws designed 
to protect 
consumers, including 
the Community 
Reinvestment Act 
and fair 
lending 
 laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions. 

 The 
Community 
Reinvestment 
Act, 
the 
Equal 
Credit 
Opportunity 
Act, 
the 
Fair 
Housing 
Act 
and 
other 
fair 
lending 
laws 
and 
 regulations impose nondiscriminatory 
lending requirements on financial 
institutions. The U.S. Department 
of Justice and other 
federal 
 agencies 
are 
responsible 
for 
enforcing 
these 
laws and 
regulations. 
A successful 
regulatory 
challenge 
to 
an 
institution's performance 
 under the Community Reinvestment 
Act, the Equal Credit 
Opportunity Act, the Fair 
Housing Act or any 
of the other fair lending 
laws 
 and regulations 
could result in 
a wide variety 
of sanctions, including 
damages and civil 
money penalties, injunctive 
relief, restrictions 
 on mergers and acquisitions 
activity, restrictions 
on expansion and restrictions on entering 
new business lines. Private parties may 
also 
 have the 
ability to 
challenge an 
institution's performance 
under fair 
lending laws 
in private 
class action 
litigation. Such 
actions could 
 have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition 
and results of operations. 

35 
 We 
face 
a 
risk 
of 
noncompliance 
and 
enforcement 
action 
related 
to 
the 
Bank 
Secrecy 
Act 
and 
other 
anti-money 
laundering 
 statutes and regulations. 
 The 
Bank 
Secrecy 
Act, 
the 
USA 
PATRIOT 
Act, 
and 
other 
laws 
and 
regulations 
require 
financial 
institutions 
to 
institute 
and 
 maintain 
an 
effective 
anti-money 
laundering 
program 
and 
file 
suspicious 
activity 
and 
currency 
transaction 
reports 
as 
appropriate, 
 among 
other 
duties. 
The 
Financial 
Crimes 
Enforcement 
Network 
is 
authorized 
to 
impose 
significant 
civil 
money 
penalties 
for 
 violations 
of 
those 
requirements 
and 
has 
recently 
engaged 
in 
coordinated 
enforcement 
efforts 
with 
the 
individual 
federal 
banking 
 regulators, as well 
as the U.S. Department 
of Justice s 
Drug Enforcement Administration. 
We 
are also subject 
to increased scrutiny 
of 
 our compliance with 
trade and economic sanctions 
requirements and rules enforced 
by OFAC. 
If our policies, procedures 
and systems 
 are deemed 
deficient, we 
would be 
subject to 
liability, 
including fines 
and regulatory 
actions, which 
may include 
restrictions on 
our 
 ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory 
approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business 
plan, including 
 our acquisition plans. Failure 
to maintain and implement adequate 
programs to combat money 
laundering and terrorist financing 
could 
 also have serious reputational consequences 
for us. Any of these results 
could have a material adverse 
effect on our business, financial 
 condition and results of operations.

 DIVIDENDS 
 Since November 
2018, the 
Corporation has 
made quarterly 
cash dividend 
payments on 
its shares 
of common 
stock. On 
April 27, 
 2022, the Corporation announced that 
it had increased the quarterly cash 
dividend payment on common stock, 
from 0.10 to 0.12 per 
 share, 
commencing 
in 
the 
second 
quarter 
of 
2022. 
In 
addition, 
on 
February 
9, 
2023 
the 
Corporation 
announced 
that 
its 
Board 
of 
 Directors 
had 
declared 
a 
quarterly 
cash 
dividend 
of 
 0.14 
per 
common 
share, 
which 
represents 
an 
increase 
of 
17 
or 
 0.02 
per 
 common 
share 
compared 
to 
its 
most 
recent 
dividend 
paid 
in 
December 
2022. 
The 
dividend 
is 
payable 
on 
March 
10, 
2023 
to 
 shareholders of 
record at 
the close 
of business 
on February 
24, 2023. 
The Corporation 
intends to 
continue to 
pay quarterly 
dividends 
 on common stock. However, 
the Corporation s common 
stock dividends, including the declaration, timing and 
amount, remain subject 
 to 
consideration 
and 
approval 
by 
the 
Corporation s 
Board 
Directors 
at 
the 
relevant 
times. 
Information 
regarding 
restrictions 
on 
 dividends, is set forth in Item 1, Business -Supervision and Regulation 
 
Dividend Restrictions and incorporated herein by reference. 

 The 2011 
PR Code, as 
amended, requires the 
withholding of income 
taxes from dividend 
income sourced 
within Puerto Rico 
to be 
 received 
by 
any 
individual, 
resident 
of 
Puerto 
Rico 
or 
not, 
trusts 
and 
estates 
and 
by 
non-resident 
custodians, 
partnerships, 
and 
 corporations. 
 Residents of Puerto Rico 
 A special tax of 15 withheld at 
source is imposed, in lieu of a regular 
tax, on any eligible dividends paid to 
individuals, trusts, and 
 estates. 
Eligible 
dividends 
include 
dividends 
paid 
by 
a 
domestic 
Puerto 
Rico 
corporation. 
However, 
the 
taxpayer 
can 
perform 
an 
 election to be excluded from the 15 special tax and be taxed at regular 
rates. Once this election is made it is irrevocable. The election 
 allows the 
taxpayer to 
include in 
ordinary income 
the eligible 
dividends received 
and take 
a credit 
for the 
amount of 
tax withheld 
in 
 excess, if any. 

 Individuals that 
are residents 
of Puerto 
Rico are 
subject to 
an alternative 
minimum tax AMT on 
the AMT 
Net Income 
if their 
 regular 
tax 
liability 
is 
less 
than 
the 
alternative 
minimum 
tax 
liability. 
The 
AMT 
applies 
to 
individual 
taxpayers 
whose 
AMT

 STOCK REPURCHASES 
 Since 
April 
2021, 
the 
Corporation s 
Board 
of 
Directors 
has 
announced 
two 
repurchase 
program 
authorizations 
for 
repurchases 
 totaling 
up 
to 
 650 
million 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
outstanding 
stock. 
Repurchases 
under 
the 
program 
may 
be 
executed 
through 
open 
 market 
purchases, 
accelerated 
share 
repurchases 
and/or 
privately 
negotiated 
transactions 
or 
plans, 
including 
under 
plans 
complying 
 with Rule 
10b5-1 under 
the Exchange 
Act. 
During 2022, 
the Corporation 
repurchased 3,409,697 
shares of 
its common

the 
 50 million

The 
 amount 
and 
timing 
of

repurchases 
will 
be 
based 
on 
various 
factors, 
including 
our 
capital

 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 First BanCorp. 
is a diversified 
financial holding 
company headquartered 
in San Juan, 
Puerto Rico offering 
a full range 
of financial 
 products to 
consumers and 
commercial customers 
through various 
subsidiaries. First 
BanCorp. 
is the 
holding company 
of FirstBank 
 Puerto 
Rico FirstBank 
or the 
 Bank 
and 
FirstBank 
Insurance 
Agency. 
Through 
its wholly 
-owned 
subsidiaries, 
the Corporation 
 operates 
in 
Puerto 
Rico, 
the 
United 
States 
Virgin 
Islands USVI ), 
the 
British 
Virgin 
Islands BVI ), 
and 
the 
state 
of 
Florida, 
 concentrating on 
commercial banking, 
residential mortgage loans, 
credit cards, personal 
loans, small loans, 
auto loans and 
leases, and 
 insurance agency activities. 
 SIGNIFICANT EVENTS 
 Economy 
 The Corporation 
remains cautiously optimistic 
on economic conditions 
in Puerto Rico, 
its principal market. 
Total 
non-farm payroll 
 employment 
rose 
to 
a 
decade 
high 
of 
927,100 
in 
December 
2022, 
or 
a 
4 
year-over-year 
increase. 
Moreover, 
the 
most 
recent 
 Economic Development 
Bank for 
Puerto Rico s 
Economic Activity 
Index EDB-EAI ), 
which is 
highly correlated 
to Puerto 
Rico s 
 real gross 
national product GNP in 
both level 
and annual 
growth rates, 
showed a 
2.6 growth 
for the 
first nine 
months of 
2022. 
 Although 
global 
expectations 
point 
to 
an 
economic 
slowdown 
in 
the 
United 
States, 
the 
Corporation 
expects 
growth 
in 
the 
local 
 economy 
to 
be 
sustained 
by 
the 
large 
amount 
of 
federal 
disaster 
relief 
funds 
that 
are 
pending 
to 
be 
disbursed. 
Over 
 45 
billion 
 remaining 
obligated 
disaster 
recovery 
funding 
has 
been 
earmarked 
to 
support 
broad 
based 
economic 
development 
and 
rebuilding 
 initiatives. 

 Growth 
in 
economic 
activity, 
the 
robustness 
of 
the 
labor 
market, 
supply 
chain 
complications 
and 
geopolitical 
matters, 
have 
 contributed to rising 
inflation. In response, 
the Federal Reserve (the 
 FED has raised interest 
rates and has 
been reducing the 
size of 
 its balance 
sheet. Furthermore, 
the FED 
signaled that 
it would 
continue to 
implement these 
policy actions 
in order 
to bring 
inflation 
 down. The 
timing and 
impact of 
inflation and 
rising interest 
rates on 
our business 
and related 
financial results 
will depend 
on future 
 developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult 
to predict. 
 
We 
delivered positive 
results in 
2022, driven 
by continued 
execution of 
strategic initiatives 
including loan 
and lease 
growth, 
and 
 expanded 
fee 
income 
while 
maintaining 
disciplined 
expense 
management. 
Credit 
continues 
to 
perform 
well, 
reflecting 
lower 
 nonaccrual and adversely 
classified loan balances, 
as well as charge 
-off rates that 
are still lower 
than pre-pandemic 
levels. We 
remain 
 vigilant to 
changing global 
economic conditions 
and the 
effect that 
restrictive monetary 
policies may 
continue to 
have on 
the overall 
 inflationary 
environment. 
We 
believe 
that 
the Corporation 
is well 
equipped 
to manage 
rising market 
challenges 
going into 
the 
next 
 cycle. 
We 
are 
highly 
encouraged 
by 
the 
growth 
prospects 
in 
our 
main 
market, 
which 
should 
continue 
to 
benefit 
from 
rebuilding 
 activity over the next few years.

 Return of Capital to Shareholders 
 In 2022, the 
Corporation returned 
approximately 363 
million, or 119 
of 2022 earnings, 
to its shareholders 
through 275 
million 
 in repurchases of common stock and the payment of 88 million in common 
stock dividends. 

 For the year ended December 
31, 2022, the Corporation repurchased 
approximately 19.4 million shares of 
common stock for a total 
 purchase 
price 
of 
 275.0 
million 
under 
previously 
publicly-announced 
stock 
repurchase 
programs. 
Of 
this 
total, 
 225.0 
million 
of 
 common 
stock, 
representing 
16.0 
million 
common 
shares 
at 
a 
weighted-average 
price 
of 
 14.06, 
were 
repurchased 
under 
the 
 350 
 million 
stock 
repurchase 
program 
announced 
on 
April 
27, 
2022 
(the 
 2022 
Repurchase 
Plan ). 
As 
of 
February 
21, 
2023, 
the 
 Corporation 
has 
repurchased 
approximately 
18.1 
million 
shares 
of 
common 
stock 
totaling 
 254.9 
million 
through 
open 
market 
 purchases 
under 
the 
2022 
Repurchase 
Plan. 
With 
the 
additional 
purchases, 
the 
Corporation 
has 
 95.1 
million 
remaining 
for 
share 
 repurchases under the 2022 Repurchase Plan. 
 On February 
9, 2023, 
the Corporation s 
Board of 
Directors declared 
a quarterly 
cash dividend 
of 0.14 
per common 
share, which 
 represents an 
increase of 
 0.02 per 
common share, 
or a 
17 increase, 
compared to 
its most 
recent dividend 
paid in 
December 2022. 
 The dividend 
is payable 
on March 
10, 
2023 to 
shareholders of 
record 
at the 
close of 
business on 
February 
24, 2023. 
The increased 
 quarterly dividend level equates to an annualized dividend of 0.56 per common 
share. 
 LIBOR Transition
 On January 1, 2022, 
the publication of certain 
U.S. Dollar USD LIBOR 
settings ceased. The 
publication of the most 
commonly 
 used 
overnight, 
one-month, 
three-month, 
six-month 
and 
twelve-month 
USD 
LIBOR 
will 
cease 
immediately 
after 
June 
30, 
2023, 
 except that 
per the 
UK Financial 
Conduct Authority 
(the FCA 
proposal, the 
one-, three-, 
and six-month 
tenors will 
continue to 
be 
 published on a non-representative, synthetic basis until September 
30, 2024. 

 The Adjustable 
Interest Rate 
Act (the 
 LIBOR Act ), 
that was 
enacted in 
March 2022, 
provides 
a statutory 
framework to 
replace 
 USD LIBOR 
for 
contracts 
governed 
by 
U.S. 
law 
that 
do 
not have 
clear 
and 
practicable 
provisions 
for 
replacing 
USD LIBOR 
after 
 June 
30, 
2023 tough 
legacy 
contracts ). 
On 
December 
16, 
2022, 
the 
FED 
adopted 
final 
rule 
12 
C.F.R. 
Part 
253, 
 Regulation 
 Implementing 
the LIBOR 
Act (Regulation 
ZZ) (the 
 Final Rule ). 
The Final 
Rule identifies 
replacement benchmark 
rates based 
on 
 the 
Secured 
Overnight 
Financing 
Rate SOFR 
to 
replace 
the 
aforementioned 
USD LIBOR 
settings 
that 
will 
cease 
after 
June 
30, 
 2023 
in 
contracts 
subject 
to 
the 
LIBOR 
Act. 
Under 
the 
final 
rule, 
tough 
legacy 
contracts 
will 
be 
converted 
by 
operation 
of 
law 
to 
 various forms of SOFR, along with a spread 
adjustment, upon a LIBOR replacement date (i.e., 
the first London banking day after June 
 30, 2023). 
The spread 
adjustment was 
designed to 
compensate for 
USD LIBOR 
being higher 
than SOFR in 
two regards. 
First, USD 
 LIBOR 
is 
an 
unsecured 
rate 
while 
SOFR 
is 
a 
secured 
rate. 
Second, 
USD 
LIBOR 
includes 
term 
premia. 
In 
addition, 
the 
final 
rule 
 codifies 
safe harbor 
protections 
for 
selection or 
use of 
SOFR as 
a replacement 
benchmark 
and 
clarifies who 
would be 
considered 
a 
 determining person 
able to 
elect a 
replacement benchmark 
when USD 
LIBOR ceases 
to be 
published as 
representative on 
June 30, 
 2023. 

 As of 
December 31, 
2022, the 
Corporation s 
risk exposure 
to USD 
LIBOR consisted 
of the 
following: (i) 
 1.4 billion 
of variable-
 rate 
commercial 
and 
construction 
loans 
(including 
unused 
commitments), 
(ii) 
 44.6 
million 
of 
U.S. 
agencies 
debt 
securities 
and 
 private label mortgage-backed securities MBS held as part 
of the available-for-sale 
debt securities portfolio, (iii) 
 124.4 million of 
 Puerto 
Rico 
municipalities 
bonds 
held 
as 
part 
of 
the 
held-to-maturity 
debt 
securities 
portfolio, 
and 
(iv) 
 183.8 
million 
of 
junior 
 subordinated 
debentures 
reported 
as 
other 
borrowings 
in 
the 
accompanying 
audited 
consolidated 
statements 
of 
financial 
condition 
 included 
in 
Item 
8 
of 
this 
Form 
10-K. 
Most 
of 
these 
contracts 
contain 
adequate 
features 
to 
convert 
to 
an 
alternative 
interest 
rate; 
 however, 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
contracts 
totaling 
approximately 
 338.6 
million 
do 
not 
contain 
fallback 
language 
mainly 
 consisting of the aforementioned 
Puerto Rico municipalities bonds held 
as part of the held-to-maturity debt 
securities portfolio and the 
 junior 
subordinated 
debentures. 
The 
Corporation 
expects 
to 
follow 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
LIBOR 
Act 
and 
Regulation 
ZZ 
for 
the 
 transition of any residual exposure after June 30, 2023. 

 The Corporation 
continues to 
execute its 
LIBOR transition 
workplan. Effective 
December 31, 
2021, the 
Corporation discontinued 
 originations 
that 
use 
USD 
LIBOR 
as 
a 
reference 
rate. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Corporation 
continues 
working 
with 
the 
update 
of 
systems, 
 processes, documentation, and models, with additional updates expected 
through 2023.

 OVERVIEW OF RESULTS 
OF OPERATIONS
 First 
BanCorp.'s 
results 
of 
operations 
depend 
primarily 
on 
its 
net 
interest 
income, 
which 
is 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
interest 
 income 
earned 
on 
its 
interest-earning 
assets, 
including 
investment 
securities 
and 
loans, 
and 
the 
interest 
expense 
incurred 
on 
its 
 interest-bearing 
liabilities, 
including 
deposits 
and 
borrowings. 
Net 
interest 
income 
is 
affected 
by 
various 
factors, 
including 
the 
 following: 
(i) 
the 
interest 
rate 
environment; 
(ii) 
the 
volumes, 
mix, 
and 
composition 
of 
interest-earning 
assets, 
and 
interest-bearing 
 liabilities; and 
(iii) the 
repricing characteristics 
of these 
assets and 
liabilities. The 
Corporation's results 
of operations 
also depend 
on 
 the provision 
for credit 
losses, non-interest 
expenses (such 
as personnel, 
occupancy, 
the deposit 
insurance premium 
and other 
costs), 
 non-interest income (mainly 
service charges and 
fees on deposits, cards 
and processing income, 
and insurance income), 
gains (losses) 
 on sales of investments, gains (losses) on mortgage banking activities, and 
income taxes. 
 The 
Corporation 
had 
net 
income 
of 
 305.1 
million, 
or 
 1.59 
per 
diluted 
common 
share, 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022, 
 compared 
to 
 281.0 
million, 
or 
 1.31 
per 
diluted 
common 
share, 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December

 The key 
drivers of 
the Corporation s 
GAAP financial 
results for 
the year 
ended December 
31, 2022, 
compared to 
the year 
ended 
 December 31, 2021, include the following: 
 
 Net interest income for 
the year ended December 
31, 2022 was 795.3 
million, compared to 729.9 
million for the year ended 
 December 31, 
2021. The 
increase in 
interest income 
primarily reflects 
a 39 
basis points 
increase in 
the net 
interest margin 
to 
 4.12 . The 
increase in 
the net interest 
margin was 
mainly driven 
by a 
higher interest 
rate environment 
driving an 
increase in 
 yields on 
variable-rate commercial 
loans, 
interest-bearing cash 
balances maintained 
at the 
FED, and 
MBS, partially 
offset by 
 higher cost of funds. 
See Net Interest Income below for additional information. 
 
 The 
provision 
for 
credit 
losses 
on 
loans, 
finance 
leases, 
unfunded 
loan 
commitments 
and 
debt 
securities 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
 December 31, 2022 
was an expense 
of 27.7 million, 
compared to a 
net benefit of 
 65.7 million for 
2021. The increase 
in the 
 overall 
provision 
reflects 
the 
growth 
in 
the 
loan 
portfolio, 
primarily 
consumer 
loans, 
and 
the 
uncertainty 
in 
the 
near-term 
 macroeconomic 
outlook. 
The benefit 
reported 
in 2021 
reflected improvement 
related 
to reduced 
uncertainties relating 
to the 
 economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily reflected in 
the commercial and residential mortgage loan portfolios. 
 Net 
charge-offs 
totaled 
 34.2 
million 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022, 
or 
0.31 
of 
average 
loans, 
compared 
to 
net 
 charge-offs 
of 55.1 
million, or 
0.48 of 
average loans, 
for the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2021. Total 
net charge-offs 
for the 
 year ended 
December 31, 
2021 included 
 23.1 million 
in net 
charge-offs 
related to 
a bulk 
sale of 
 52.5 million 
of residential 
 mortgage nonaccrual 
loans and related 
servicing advance receivables. 
Adjusted for those 
net charge-offs, 
total net charge 
-offs 
 in 2021 
on a 
non-GAAP basis 
were 32.0 
million, 
or 0.28 
of average 
loans. 
The increase 
in adjusted 
net charge 
-offs 
was 
 primarily 
reflected in 
consumer 
loans, as 
well as 
lower commercial 
loans loss 
recoveries. See 
 Provision 
for Credit 
Losses 
 and Risk Management below for analyses of the ACL and non-performing assets and 
related ratios. 
 
 The Corporation 
recorded non-interest 
income of 
 123.1 million 
for the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2022, compared 
to 121.2 
 million for 
2021. The 
 1.9 million 
increase was 
primarily driven 
by higher 
transactional fee 
income from 
card and 
merchant 
 transactions, 
a 
higher 
realization 
of 
purchased 
income 
tax 
credits, 
and 
an 
increase 
in 
service 
charges 
and 
fees 
on 
deposit 
 accounts, 
partially offset 
by a 
decrease in 
revenues from 
mortgage banking 
activities, primarily 
related to 
a lower 
volume of 
 sales. See Non-Interest Income below for additional information. 

Non-interest expenses 
for the year 
ended December 31, 
2022 were 
 443.1 million, compared 
to 489.0 million 
in 2021. Non-
 interest 
expenses 
for 
2021 
included 
 26.4 
million 
of 
merger 
and 
restructuring 
costs 
associated 
with 
the 
acquisition 
and 
 integration 
of Banco 
Santander 
Puerto 
Rico BSPR 
and 
 3.0 
million of 
COVID-19 pandemic 
-related 
expenses, primarily 
 related 
to 
additional 
cleaning, 
safety 
materials, 
and 
security 
measures. 
Adjusted 
for 
the 
above-mentioned 
merger 
and 
 restructuring 
costs and 
COVID-19 
expenses, 
on 
a 
non-GAAP basis, 
total 
non-interest 
expenses 
in 
2022 
decreased 
by 16.5 
 million, 
when 
compared 
to 
adjusted 
total 
non-interest 
expenses 
in 
2021, 
mainly 
driven 
by 
a 
decrease 
in 
outsourcing 
 technology service fees, higher 
gains on other real 
estate owned OREO activities, 
as well as reductions 
in the amortization 
 of intangible 
assets and 
charges to 
legal and 
operational reserves. 
The efficiency 
ratio for 
the year 
ended December 
31, 2022 
 was 
48.25 , 
as 
compared 
to 
57.45 
for 
2021. 
See 
 Non-Interest 
Expenses 
and 
 Special 
Items 
below 
for 
additional 
 information. 

For 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
recorded 
an 
income 
tax 
expense 
of 
 142.5 
million, 
compared 
to 
 146.8 million 
for 2021. 
The variance 
was primarily 
related to 
a lower 
effective tax 
rate as 
a result 
of a 
higher proportion 
of 
 exempt to 
taxable income 
when compared 
to 2021, 
partially offset 
by higher 
pre-tax income. 
As of 
December 31, 
2022, the 
 Corporation s 
net deferred 
tax asset 
amounted to 
 155.6 million 
(net of 
a valuation 
allowance of 
 185.5 million, 
including a 
 valuation 
allowance 
of 
 149.5 
million 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
banking 
subsidiary, 
FirstBank), 
compared 
to 
a 
net 
deferred 
tax 
 asset 
of 
 208.4 
million 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2021. 
See 
 Income 
Taxes 
below 
and 
Note 
22 
 
Income 
Taxes, 
to 
the 
audited 
 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K 
for additional information. 

As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
total 
assets 
were 
approximately 
 18.6 
billion, 
down 
 2.2 
billion 
from 
December 
31, 
2021. 
The 
 decrease includes 
a 2.1 billion 
decline in cash 
and cash equivalents 
mainly in 
connection with customer 
deposit withdrawals 
 and maturities, 
as well 
as capital 
return to 
stockholders. In 
addition, there 
was a 571.4 
million decrease 
in total 
investments, 
 driven 
by 
net 
unrealized 
losses 
of 
available-for-sale 
debt 
securities 
of 
 718.6 
million 
recorded 
during 
the 
year 
attributed 
to 
 changes 
in 
market 
interest 
rates. 
These 
variances 
were 
partially 
offset 
by 
growth 
of 
 469.3 
million 
in 
total 
loans. 
See 
 Financial Condition and Operating Data Analysis below for additional information. 

As of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
total liabilities 
were 
 17.3 
billion, 
down 
 1.4 
billion 
from 
December 
31, 
2021. 
The decline 
was 
 mainly 
driven 
by 
a 
 1.6 
billion 
decrease 
in 
total 
deposits, 
partially 
offset 
by 
a 
 250.1 
million 
net 
increase 
in 
borrowings, 
 primarily short-term 
advances from 
the FHLB and 
repurchase agreements. 
The decline 
in total deposits 
reflected the 
effect of 
 customers 
allocation 
of 
cash 
into 
higher 
yielding 
alternatives 
and 
elevated 
customer 
spending, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
reduction 
in 
 transactional account balances of government deposits. See 
 Risk Management Liquidity Risk and Capital Adequacy below 
 for additional information about the Corporation s 
funding sources and strategy. 

45 
 
 The 
Bank s 
primary 
sources 
of 
funding 
are 
consumer 
and 
commercial 
core 
deposits. 
As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
these 
core 
 deposits 
funded 
71 
of 
total 
assets. 
Other 
sources 
of 
liquidity 
include 
non-core 
deposits, 
such 
as 
brokered 
CDs 
and 
 government 
deposits as 
well 
as repurchase 
agreements 
and 
FHLB 
advances. 
The 
Bank 
maintains 
borrowing 
capacity 
at 
the 
 FHLB 
and 
the 
FED 
Discount 
Window. 
Although 
currently 
not 
in 
use, 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
had 
 approximately 
 1.3 
billion 
available 
for 
funding 
under 
the 
FED s 
Discount 
Window 
and 
 644.2 
million 
available 
for 
 additional borrowing capacity on FHLB lines of credit based on collateral 
pledged at these entities. 
 
 As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation s 
stockholders 
equity 
was 
 1.3 
billion, 
a 
decrease 
of 
 776.2 
million 
from 
 December 31, 2021. 
The decline was driven 
by a 718.6 
million decrease in 
the fair value 
of available-for-sale 
debt securities 
 recorded as 
part of 
accumulated other 
comprehensive loss 
in the 
consolidated statements 
of financial 
condition, as 
a result 
of 
 changes 
in 
market 
interest 
rates. The 
decrease 
in 
total stockholders 
equity 
also reflects 
the 
purchase 
of 
approximately 
19.4 
 million 
shares 
of 
common 
stock 
for 
a 
total 
purchase 
price 
of 
approximately 
 275.0 
million 
and 
 88.2 
million 
in 
dividends 
 declared to common 
stock shareholders during 
2022. These variances 
were partially offset 
by earnings generated during 
2022. 
 The 
Corporation s 
common 
equity 
tier 
1 CET1 
capital, 
tier 
1 
capital, 
total 
capital, 
and 
leverage 
ratios 
were 
16.53 , 
 16.53 , 19.21 , 
and 10.70 , 
respectively, 
as of 
December 31, 
2022, compared 
to CET1 
capital, tier 
1 capital, 
total capital, 
 and leverage ratios 
of 17.80 , 17.80 , 
20.50 , and 10.14 , respectively, 
as of December 31, 
2021. 
See Risk Management

 Total 
loan 
production, 
including 
purchases, 
refinancings, 
renewals, 
and 
draws 
from 
existing 
revolving 
and 
non-revolving 
 commitments, but 
excluding the 
utilization activity 
on outstanding 
credit cards, 
increased by 
 42.9 million 
to 4.9 
billion for 
 the 
year 
ended 
December 31, 
2022, 
compared 
to 4.8 
billion 
for 2021. 
The Corporation 
originated 
 283.6 
million 
of Small 
 Business 
Administration 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program SBA 
PPP 
loans 
during 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2021. 
 Excluding 
SBA 
PPP 
loan 
originations, 
total 
loan 
originations 
increased 
by 
 326.5 
million 
consisting 
of 
a 
 231.5 
million 
 increase 
in 
consumer 
loan 
originations 
and 
a 
 249.7 
million 
increase 
in 
commercial 
and 
construction 
loan 
originations, 
 partially offset by a 154.7 million decrease in residential mortgage 
loan originations. 

Total 
non-performing assets 
were 129.2 
million as 
of December 
31, 2022, 
a decrease 
of 28.9 
million, from 
December 31, 
 2021. 
The 
decrease 
was 
driven 
by: 
(i) 
a 
 12.8 
million 
decrease 
in 
nonaccrual 
commercial 
and 
construction 
loans, 
mainly 
 related 
to 
 8.5 
million 
in 
loans 
restored 
to 
accrual 
status 
and 
collections; 
(ii) 
a 
 12.3 
million 
reduction 
in 
nonaccrual 
 residential mortgage loans, 
mostly driven by collections 
and foreclosures; and 
(iii) a 8.1 million 
decrease in OREO and 
other 
 assets, mainly 
associated with 
sales of 
OREO residential 
properties in 
the Puerto 
Rico region. 
These variances 
were partially 
 offset 
by 
an 
increase 
of 
 4.3 
million 
in 
nonaccrual 
consumer 
loans. 
See 
 Risk 
Management 
 
Nonaccrual 
Loans 
and 
Non-
 Performing Assets below for additional information. 
 
 Adversely classified commercial and 
construction loans decreased by 
 83.7 million to 93.6 million 
as of December 31, 2022, 
 compared to 
December 31, 
2021. The 
decrease was 
mostly driven 
by 31.8 
million in 
payoffs and 
paydowns associated 
with 
 six commercial and construction loans, 
each in excess of 1 million, 
the sale of a 23.9 million commercial 
and industrial loan 
 participation 
in the 
Florida region, 
and the 
upgrades in 
the credit 
risk classification 
of three 
commercial 
and industrial 
loans 
 totaling 
 12.3 
million. 
The 
Corporation 
monitors 
its 
loan 
portfolio 
to 
identify 
potential 
at-risk

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The 
accounting 
principles 
of 
the 
Corporation 
and 
the 
methods 
of 
applying 
these 
principles 
conform 
to 
GAAP. 
In 
preparing 
the 
 consolidated 
financial 
statements, 
management 
is 
required 
to 
make 
estimates, 
assumptions, 
and 
judgments 
that 
affect 
the 
amounts 
 recorded for assets, 
liabilities and contingent 
liabilities as of 
the date of 
the financial statements 
and the reported 
amounts of revenues 
 and 
expenses 
during 
the 
reporting 
periods. 
Accounting 
estimates 
require 
assumptions 
and 
judgments 
about 
uncertain 
matters 
that 
 could 
have 
a 
material 
effect 
on 
the 
consolidated 
financial 
statements. 
The 
Corporation s 
critical 
accounting 
estimates 
that 
are 
 particularly 
susceptible 
to 
significant 
changes 
include 
the 
following: 
(i) 
the 
ACL; 
(ii) 
valuation 
of 
financial 
instruments; 
and 
(iii) 
 income taxes. Actual results could differ from estimates and assumptions 
if different outcomes or conditions prevail. 

 Allowance for Credit Losses
 The Corporation 
maintains an ACL 
for loans 
and finance 
leases based upon 
management s 
estimate of the 
lifetime expected 
credit 
 losses in the loan portfolio, as of the balance sheet date, excluding 
loans held for sale. Additionally, 
the Corporation maintains an ACL 
 for 
held-to-maturity 
or 
available-for-sale 
debt 
securities, 
and 
other 
off-balance 
sheet 
credit 
exposures e.g.
 , unfunded 
loan 
 commitments). For loans and finance leases, unfunded loan commitments, 
and held-to-maturity debt securities, the estimate of lifetime 
 credit losses 
includes the 
use of 
quantitative models 
that incorporate 
forward-looking macroeconomic 
scenarios that 
are applied 
over 
 the 
contractual 
lives 
of 
the 
portfolios, 
adjusted, 
as 
appropriate, 
for 
prepayments 
and 
permitted 
extension 
options 
using 
historical 
 experience. 
For 
purposes 
of 
the 
ACL 
for 
lending 
commitments, 
such 
allowance 
is 
determined 
using 
the 
same 
methodology 
as 
the 
 ACL 
for 
loans, 
while 
also 
taking 
into 
consideration 
the 
probability 
of 
drawdowns 
or 
funding, 
and 
whether 
such 
commitments 
are 
 cancellable by us. The 
ACL for available-for-sale debt 
securities is measured using a 
risk-adjusted discounted cash flow 
approach that 
 also 
considers 
relevant 
current 
and 
forward-looking 
economic 
variables 
and 
the 
ACL 
is 
limited 
to 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
fair 
 value of the security 
and its amortized cost. 
Judgment is specifically applied 
in the determination of 
economic assumptions, the length 
 of 
the 
initial 
loss 
forecast 
period, 
the 
reversion 
of 
losses 
beyond 
the 
initial 
forecast 
period, 
historical 
loss 
expectations, 
usage 
of 
 macroeconomic 
scenarios, 
and 
qualitative 
factors, 
which 
may 
not 
be 
adequately 
captured 
in 
the 
loss 
model, 
as 
further 
discussed 
 below. 
 The macroeconomic 
scenarios utilized by 
the Corporation include 
variables that have 
historically been key 
drivers of increases and 
 decreases 
in 
credit 
losses. 
These 
variables 
include, 
but 
are 
not 
limited 
to, 
unemployment 
rates, 
housing 
and 
commercial 
real 
estate 
 prices, gross domestic 
product levels, retail 
sales, interest rate 
forecasts, corporate 
bond spreads, and 
changes in equity 
market prices. 
 The 
Corporation 
derives 
the 
economic 
forecasts 
it 
uses 
in 
its 
ACL 
model 
from 
Moody's 
Analytics. 
The 
latter 
has 
a 
large 
team 
of 
 economists, database managers and operational engineers with a history 
of producing monthly economic forecasts for over 25 years. 
 The 
Corporation 
has 
currently 
set 
an 
initial 
forecast 
period reasonable 
and 
supportable 
period 
of 
two 
years 
and 
a 
reversion 
 period of up to three 
years, utilizing a straight-line 
approach and reverting back 
to the historical macroeconomic 
mean for Puerto Rico 
 and the Virgin 
Islands regions. For the 
Florida region, the methodology 
considers a reasonable and 
supportable forecast period 
and an 
 implicit reversion towards the historical 
trend that varies for each macroeconomic 
variable. After the reversion period, 
a historical loss 
 forecast 
period 
covering 
the 
remaining 
contractual 
life, 
adjusted 
for 
prepayments, 
is 
used 
based 
on 
the 
change 
in 
key 
historical 
 economic variables 
during representative 
historical expansionary 
and recessionary periods. 
Changes in economic 
forecasts impact the 
 probability 
of 
default PD ), 
loss-given 
default LGD ), 
and 
exposure 
at 
default EAD 
for 
each 
instrument, 
and 
therefore 
 influence the amount of future cash flows for each instrument that the Corporation 
does not expect to collect. 
 Further, 
the 
Corporation 
periodically 
considers 
the 
need 
for 
qualitative 
adjustments 
to 
the 
ACL. 
Qualitative 
adjustments 
may 
be 
 related to and include, 
but not be limited to, 
factors such as the 
following: (i) management s 
assessment of economic forecasts 
used in 
 the 
model 
and 
how 
those 
forecasts 
align 
with 
management s 
overall 
evaluation 
of 
current 
and 
expected 
economic 
conditions; 
(ii) 
 organization specific 
risks such 
as credit 
concentrations, collateral 
specific risks, 
nature, 
and size 
of the portfolio 
and external 
factors 
 that may 
ultimately impact 
credit quality, 
and (iii) 
other limitations 
associated with 
factors such 
as changes 
in underwriting 
and loan 
 resolution 
strategies, 
among 
others. 
The 
qualitative 
factors 
applied 
at 
December 
31, 
2022, 
and 
the 
importance 
and 
levels 
of 
the 
 qualitative 
factors 
applied, 
may 
change 
in 
future 
periods 
depending 
on 
the 
level 
of 
changes 
to 
items 
such 
as 
the 
uncertainty 
of 
 economic 
conditions 
and 
management's 
assessment 
of 
the 
level 
of 
credit 
risk 
within 
the loan 
portfolio 
as 
a 
result 
of 
such 
changes, 
 compared 
to the 
amount of 
ACL calculated 
by the 
model. 
The evaluation 
of qualitative 
factors 
is inherently 
imprecise 
and 
requires 
 significant management judgment. 

49 
 The ACL can also be 
impacted by factors outside the Corporation s 
control, which include unanticipated 
changes in asset quality of 
 the 
portfolio, 
such 
as deterioration 
in 
borrower 
delinquencies, 
or 
credit 
scores 
in 
our 
residential 
real 
estate 
and 
consumer 
portfolio. 
 Further, 
the current 
fair 
value of 
collateral 
is utilized 
to assess 
the 
expected 
credit losses 
when 
a financial 
asset is 
considered 
to be 
 collateral dependent. 
 Our process 
for determining 
the ACL is 
further discussed

 Policies,

scenarios to estimate the 
ACL, changes in key 
economic variables, and

 sensitivity analysis performed as of December 31, 2022. 
 Valuation 
of financial instruments
 The measurement 
of fair value 
is fundamental 
to the Corporation s 
presentation of 
its financial condition 
and results of 
operations. 
 The 
Corporation 
holds 
debt 
and 
equity 
securities, 
derivatives, 
and 
other 
financial 
instruments 
at 
fair 
value. 
The 
Corporation s 
 significant assets 
reflected at 
fair value 
on a 
recurring basis 
on the 
Corporation s 
financial statements 
consisted 
of available-for-sale 
 debt 
securities 
amounting 
to 
 5.6 
billion 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2022. 
In 
addition, 
fair 
value 
is 
also 
used 
for 
measuring 
other 
non-
 recurring fair value assets such as collateral dependent loans, OREO, and loans 
held for sale. 
 Assets 
and 
liabilities 
carried 
at 
fair 
value 
inherently 
include 
subjectivity 
and 
may 
require 
the 
use 
of 
significant 
assumptions, 
 adjustments and 
judgment including, 
among others, 
discount rates, 
cash flows, 
default rates, 
and loss 
rates. 
A significant 
change 
in 
 assumptions 
may 
result 
in 
a 
significant 
change 
in 
fair 
value, 
which 
in 
turn, 
may 
result 
in 
a 
higher 
degree 
of 
financial 
statement 
 volatility 
and 
could 
result 
in 
significant 
impact 
on 
our 
results 
of 
operations, 
financial 
condition 
or 
disclosures 
of 
fair 
value 
 information. 
 
The 
fair value 
of a 
financial 
instrument 
is the 
amount 
that would 
be received 
to 
sell an 
asset or 
paid 
to transfer 
a 
liability 
in 
an 
 orderly transaction 
between market 
participants at 
the measurement 
date. The 
Corporation categorizes 
the fair 
value of 
its available-
 for-sale 
debt 
securities 
using 
a 
three-level 
hierarchy 
for 
fair 
value 
measurements 
that 
distinguishes 
between 
market 
participant 
 assumptions 
developed 
based 
on 
market 
data 
obtained 
from 
sources 
independent 
of 
the 
Corporation 
(observable 
inputs) 
and 
the 
 Corporation s 
own 
assumptions 
about 
market 
participant 
assumptions 
developed 
based 
on 
the 
best 
information 
available 
in 
the 
 circumstances 
(unobservable 
inputs). 
The 
hierarchy 
of 
inputs 
used 
in 
determining 
the 
fair 
value 
maximizes 
the 
use 
of 
observable 
 inputs and 
minimizes the 
use of 
unobservable inputs 
by requiring 
that observable 
inputs be 
used when 
available. The 
hierarchy level 
 assigned 
to each 
security 
in the 
Corporation s 
investment portfolio 
was based 
on management s 
assessment of 
the transparency 
and 
 reliability of the inputs used to estimate the fair values at the measurement 
date. 

 The fair value 
of available-for-sale debt 
securities was based 
on unadjusted quoted 
market prices (as 
is the case with 
U.S. Treasury 
 securities 
and 
equity 
securities 
with 
readily 
determinable 
fair 
values), 
when 
available 
(Level 
1). 
If 
quoted 
market 
prices 
are 
 unavailable, the 
fair value 
is based on 
market prices 
for comparable 
assets (as is 
the case 
with MBS 
and U.S. 
agency debt 
securities) 
 that are 
based on 
observable market 
parameters, 
including benchmark 
yields, reported 
trades, quotes 
from brokers 
or dealers, 
issuer 
 spreads, 
bids, 
offers, 
and 
reference 
data, 
including 
market 
research 
operations, 
when 
available 
(Level 
2). 
Observable 
prices 
in 
the 
 market 
already consider 
the risk 
of nonperformance. 
If listed 
prices or 
quotes 
are not 
available, fair 
value 
is based 
upon discounted 
 cash flow 
models that 
use unobservable 
inputs due 
to the 
limited market 
activity of 
the instrument, 
as is 
the case 
with private 
label 
 MBS held 
by the 
Corporation (Level 
3). Assets 
are classified 
in their 
entirety based 
on the 
lowest level 
of input 
that is 
significant to 
 their fair value measurement.
 Private label MBS 
are collateralized 
by fixed-rate 
mortgages on single-family 
residential properties 
in the U.S. 
with original 
FICO 
 scores 
over 
700 
and 
moderate 
loan-to-value 
ratios 
(under 
80 ), 
as 
well 
as 
moderate 
delinquency 
levels. 
The 
interest 
rate 
on 
the 
 securities 
is variable, 
tied to 
3-month 
LIBOR, 
and 
limited to 
the weighted 
-average 
coupon of 
the underlying 
collateral. 
The market 
 valuation represents 
the estimated 
net cash 
flows over 
the projected 
life of 
the pool 
of underlying 
assets applying 
a discount 
rate that 
 reflects market 
observed floating 
spreads over 
LIBOR, with 
a widening 
spread based 
on a nonrated 
security. 
The market 
valuation is 
 derived 
from 
a 
model 
that 
utilizes 
relevant 
assumptions 
such 
as 
the 
prepayment 
rate, 
default 
rate, 
and 
loss 
severity 
on 
a 
loan 
level 
 basis. The 
Corporation modeled 
the cash 
flow from 
the fixed-rate 
mortgage collateral 
using 
a static 
cash flow 
analysis according 
to 
 collateral attributes 
of the 
underlying mortgage 
pool i.e.
 , loan 
term, current 
balance, note 
rate, rate 
adjustment type, 
rate adjustment 
 frequency, 
rate 
caps, 
and 
others) 
in 
combination 
with 
prepayment 
forecasts 
based 
on 
historical 
portfolio 
performance. 
The 
 Corporation models the variable cash flow of the security using the 3-month 
LIBOR forward curve. 
 Declines in fair 
value that are 
credit-related are 
recorded on the 
balance sheet 
through an 
ACL with a 
corresponding adjustment 
to 
 provision for credit losses and declines that are non-credit-related are 
recognized through other comprehensive income (loss). 
 If the 
Corporation intends 
to sell a 
debt security 
in an 
unrealized loss 
position or 
determines that 
it is more 
likely than 
not that 
the 
 Corporation will be 
required to sell 
a debt security 
before it recovers 
its amortized cost 
basis, the debt 
security is written 
down to fair 
 value 
through 
earnings. 
As 
of December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
did 
not 
intend 
to 
sell 
any 
debt 
securities 
in 
an 
unrealized 
loss 

50 
 position 
and 
it 
is 
not 
more 
likely 
than 
not 
that 
the 
Corporation 
will 
be 
required 
to 
sell any 
debt 
securities 
before 
recovery 
of 
their 
 amortized cost basis. 
 For 
debt 
securities 
in 
an unrealized 
loss position 
for 
which the 
Corporation 
does not 
intend 
to sell 
the debt 
security 
and 
it is 
not 
 more likely than 
not that the 
Corporation will be 
required to sell 
the debt security, 
the Corporation determines 
whether the loss 
is due 
 to 
credit-related 
factors 
or 
non-credit-related 
factors. 
For 
debt 
securities 
in 
an 
unrealized 
loss 
position 
for 
which 
the 
losses 
are 
 determined to be 
the result of both 
credit-related and non-credit-related 
factors, the credit loss 
is determined as 
the difference between 
 the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, and the amortized 
cost basis of the debt security. 

 Available-for-sale 
debt securities 
held by 
the Corporation 
at year-end 
primarily consisted 
of securities 
issued by 
U.S. government-
 sponsored entities GSEs ), and 
the aforementioned 
private label 
MBS. 
Given the 
explicit and 
implicit guarantees 
provided by 
the 
 U.S. federal government, the Corporation believes the credit risk in 
securities issued by the GSEs is low. 
For the year ended December 
 31, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
determined 
the 
credit 
losses 
for 
private 
label 
MBS 
based 
on 
a 
risk-adjusted 
discounted 
cash 
flow 
 methodology that 
considers qualitative 
and quantitative 
factors specific 
to the 
instruments, including 
PDs and 
LGDs that 
considered, 
 among 
other 
things, 
historical 
payment 
performance, 
loan-to-value 
attributes, 
and 
relevant 
current 
and 
forward-looking 
 macroeconomic 
variables, 
such 
as 
regional 
unemployment 
rates 
and 
the 
housing 
price 
index. 
Under 
this 
approach, 
expected 
cash 
 flows (interest and principal) were discounted at the Treasury 
yield curve as of the reporting date. 

 See 
Note 
25 
 
Fair 
Value, 
to 
the 
audited 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
included 
in 
Item 
8 
of 
this 
Form 
10-K, 
for 
additional 
 information. 
 Income Taxes 

 The Corporation is required to estimate income taxes in preparing 
its consolidated financial statements. This involves the estimation 
 of 
current 
income 
tax 
expense 
together 
with 
an 
assessment 
of 
temporary 
differences 
between 
the 
carrying 
amounts 
of 
assets 
and 
 liabilities 
for 
financial 
reporting 
purposes 
and 
the 
amounts 
used 
for 
income 
tax 
purposes. 
The 
determination 
of 
current 
income 
tax 
 expense 
involves 
estimates 
and 
assumptions 
that 
require 
the 
Corporation 
to 
assume 
certain 
positions 
based 
on 
its 
interpretation 
of 
 current tax regulations. Management assesses the relative benefits and 
risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions, taking into 
 account statutory, 
judicial and regulatory 
guidance, and recognizes 
tax benefits 
only when deemed 
probable. Changes 
in assumptions 
 affecting estimates 
may be required 
in the future 
and estimated tax 
liabilities may need 
to be increased 
or decreased accordingly. 
The 
 Corporation adjusts 
the accrual 
of tax 
contingencies in 
light of 
changing facts 
and circumstances, 
such as 
the progress 
of tax 
audits, 
 case law 
and emerging 
legislation. The 
Corporation s 
effective tax 
rate includes 
the impact 
of tax 
contingencies and 
changes to 
such 
 accruals, 
as 
considered 
appropriate 
by 
management. 
When 
particular 
tax 
matters 
arise, 
a 
number 
of 
years 
may 
elapse 
before 
such 
 matters are 
audited by 
the taxing 
authorities and 
finally resolved. 
Favorable resolution 
of such matters 
or the 
expiration of 
the statute 
 of limitations may result in the release of tax contingencies that the 
Corporation recognizes as a reduction to its effective 
tax rate in the 
 year of resolution. 
Unfavorable settlement 
of any particular 
issue could increase 
the effective 
tax rate and 
may require the 
use of cash 
 in the year of resolution. 
 As of December 31, 
2022, we had 155.6 
million of deferred tax 
assets, net of a related 
valuation allowance of 185.5 
million. The 
 determination 
of 
deferred 
tax 
expense 
or 
benefit 
is 
based 
on 
changes 
in 
the 
carrying 
amounts 
of 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
that 
generate 
 temporary differences 
and recognizes 
enacted changes 
in tax 
rates and 
laws in 
the period 
in which 
they occur. 
The carrying 
value of 
 the Corporation s net deferred tax 
asset assumes that the Corporation will be able to generate sufficient 
future taxable income based on 
 estimates and 
assumptions. Valuation 
allowances are 
established, when 
necessary, 
to reduce 
deferred tax 
assets to 
the amount 
that is 
 more likely than not to be realized. 
The determination of whether a valuation 
allowance for deferred tax assets is appropriate 
is subject 
 to 
considerable 
judgment 
and 
requires 
the 
evaluation 
of 
positive 
and 
negative 
evidence 
that 
can 
be 
objectively 
verified. 
Positive 
 evidence 
necessary 
to 
overcome 
the 
negative 
evidence 
includes 
whether 
future 
taxable 
income 
in 
sufficient 
amounts 
and 
character 
 within the carryforward periods is 
available under the tax law. 
Consideration must be given to 
all sources of taxable income including, 
 as 
applicable, 
the 
future 
reversal 
of 
existing 
temporary 
differences, 
future 
taxable 
income 
forecasts 
exclusive 
of 
the 
reversal 
of 
 temporary differences and 
carryforwards, and tax planning 
strategies. When negative evidence (e.g., 
cumulative losses in recent years, 
 history 
of operating 
loss or 
tax credit 
carryforwards 
expiring 
unused) 
exists, more 
positive 
evidence 
than negative 
evidence 
will be 
 necessary. 
The Corporation 
has concluded 
that based on 
the level 
of positive 
evidence, it 
is more 
likely than 
not that 
the deferred 
tax 
 asset will be realized, net of the existing valuation allowances 
at December 31, 2022 
and 2021. However, there is no 
guarantee that the 
 tax benefits associated 
with the deferred 
tax assets will be 
fully realized. The 
positive evidence considered 
by management in 
arriving 
 at 
its 
conclusion 
included 
factors 
such 
as 
the 
following: 
FirstBank s 
three-year 
cumulative 
income 
position; 
sustained 
periods 
of 
 profitability; management s 
proven ability to 
forecast future income 
accurately and execute 
tax strategies; and 
the utilization of NOLs 
 over the past three years. The negative evidence 
considered by management included the following: uncertainties 
about the state of the 
 Puerto Rico 
economy, 
including considerations 
relating to 
the effect 
of hurricane 
and pandemic 
recovery funds 
together with 
Puerto 
 Rico 
government 
debt 
restructuring 
and 
the 
ultimate 
sustainability 
of 
the 
latest 
fiscal 
plan 
certified 
by 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
Oversight, 
 Management, and Economic Stability Act PROMESA oversight board.

 OTHER ESTIMATES 
 In addition 
to the 
critical accounting 
estimates we 
make in connection 
with the 
ACL, fair 
value measurements, 
and the accounting 
 for income 
taxes, the 
use of 
estimates and 
assumptions is 
also important 
in determining 
the accounting 
for goodwill 
and identifiable 
 intangible 
assets, 
pension 
and 
postretirement 
benefit 
obligations, 
and 
provisions 
for 
losses 
that 
may 
arise 
from 
litigation 
and 
 regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations).
 Goodwill is 
assessed for 
impairment at 
least annually 
and more 
frequently if 
circumstances exist 
that indicate 
a possible 
reduction 
 in the 
fair value 
of a 
reporting unit 
below its 
carrying value. 
When assessing 
goodwill for 
impairment, first, 
a qualitative 
assessment 
 can be 
made to 
determine whether 
it is 
more likely 
than not 
that the 
estimated fair 
value of 
a reporting 
unit is 
less than 
its estimated 
 carrying value. If 
the results of the 
qualitative assessment are 
not conclusive, a 
quantitative goodwill test 
is performed. Estimating 
the 
 fair 
value 
of 
our 
reporting 
units 
requires 
judgment. 
Critical 
inputs 
to 
the 
fair 
value 
estimates 
may 
include 
projected 
earnings, 
 macroeconomic conditions, 
interest rate 
levels, and 
peers performance. 
See Note 1 
 Nature of 
Business and 
Summary of 
Significant 
 Accounting Policies and 
Note 9 
Goodwill and Other 
Intangibles, to the 
audited consolidated 
financial statements included 
in Item 8 
 of 
this Form 
10-K, 
for 
further 
information 
about 
goodwill and 
identifiable 
intangible 
assets, including 
intangible 
assets recorded 
in 
 connection 
with the acquisition of BSPR. 

Identifiable 
intangible 
assets 
are 
tested 
for 
impairment 
when 
events 
or 
changes 
in 
circumstances 
suggest 
that 
an 
asset s 
or 
asset 
 group s 
carrying 
value 
may 
not 
be 
fully 
recoverable. 
Judgment 
is 
required 
to 
evaluate 
whether 
indications 
of 
potential 
impairment 
 have 
occurred, 
and 
to 
test intangible 
assets for 
impairment, 
if 
required. 
An 
impairment 
is recognized 
if 
the 
estimated 
undiscounted 
 cash flows 
relating to 
the asset 
or asset 
group is 
less than 
the corresponding 
carrying value. 
The amortization 
of identified 
intangible 
 assets 
is 
based 
upon 
the 
estimated 
economic 
benefits 
to 
be 
received 
over 
their 
economic 
life, 
which 
is 
also 
subjective. 
Customer 
 attrition rates that are based on historical experience are used to determine the 
estimated economic life of intangibles assets. 
 As part of the BSPR acquisition, 
the Corporation maintains two frozen 
qualified noncontributory defined benefit 
pension plans, and 
 a related complementary 
postretirement benefits plan 
covering medical benefits 
and life insurance after 
retirement. 
Calculation of the 
 obligations and related 
expenses under these 
plans requires the 
use of actuarial 
valuation methods 
and assumptions, which 
are subject 
 to 
management 
judgment 
and 
may 
differ 
if 
different 
assumptions 
are 
used. 
The 
discount 
rate 
assumption 
used 
to 
measure 
the 
 postretirement 
benefit obligation 
is estimated 
as the 
single equivalent 
rate such 
that the 
present value 
of the 
plan s 
projected benefit 
 obligation cash 
flows using 
the single 
rate equals 
the present 
value of 
those cash 
flows using 
the above 
mean actuarial 
yield curves.

for 
 disclosures related to the benefit plans. 

 As necessary, 
we 
also estimate 
and 
provide 
for potential 
losses that 
may 
arise out 
of litigation 
and 
regulatory 
proceedings 
to the 
 extent 
that 
such losses 
are 
probable 
and 
can be 
reasonably 
estimated. 
Judgment 
is required 
in making 
these 
estimates 
and 
our 
final 
 liabilities may 
ultimately be 
materially different. 
Our total 
estimated liability 
with respect 
to litigation 
and regulatory 
proceedings is 
 determined on 
a case-by-case basis 
and represents 
an estimate 
of probable 
losses after 
considering, among 
other factors, 
the progress 
 of each case, our experience and the experience of 
others in similar cases, proceedings or investigations, and 
the opinions and views of 
 legal counsel. 
The outcomes 
of legal 
actions are 
unpredictable and 
subject to 
significant uncertainties, 
and it 
is inherently 
difficult to 
 determine whether any loss is probable or even 
possible. It is also inherently difficult to estimate 
the amount of any loss and there may 
 be matters for which 
a loss is probable or 
reasonably possible but not currently 
estimable. Accordingly, 
actual losses may be in 
excess 
 of 
the 
established 
accrual 
or 
the 
range 
of 
reasonably 
possible 
loss.

 RESULTS 
OF OPERATIONS
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest 
income is 
the excess of 
interest earned 
by First BanCorp. 
on its interest-earning 
assets over 
the interest 
incurred on its 
 interest-bearing 
liabilities. 
First 
BanCorp. s 
net 
interest 
income 
is 
subject 
to 
interest 
rate 
risk 
due 
to 
the 
repricing 
and 
maturity 
 mismatch 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
assets 
and 
liabilities. 
In 
addition, 
variable 
sources 
of 
interest 
income, 
such 
as 
loan 
fees, 
periodic 
 dividends, and 
collection of 
interest on 
nonaccrual loans, 
can fluctuate 
from period 
to period. 
Net interest 
income for 
the year 
ended 
 December 31, 2022 was 795.3 
million, compared to 729.9 million 
for 2021. 
On a tax-equivalent basis and excluding 
the changes in 
 the fair 
value of 
derivative 
instruments, net 
interest income 
for the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2022 was 
 828.4 million 
compared 
to 
 753.7 
million 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2021. 
Net 
interest 
income 
on 
an 
adjusted 
tax-equivalent 
basis 
and 
excluding 
the 
 change 
in the 
fair 
value 
of derivative 
instruments 
is a 
non-GAAP 
financial 
measure. 
For the 
definition 
of this 
non-GAAP 
financial 
 measure, refer to the discussion in Basis of Presentation below. 
 The 
following 
tables 
include a 
detailed 
analysis 
of net 
interest income 
for 
the indicated 
periods. 
Part I 
presents 
average volumes 
 (based 
on 
the 
average 
daily 
balance) 
and 
rates 
on 
an 
adjusted 
tax-equivalent 
basis 
and 
Part 
II 
presents, 
also 
on 
an 
adjusted 
tax-
 equivalent basis, 
the extent 
to which 
changes in 
interest rates 
and changes 
in the 
volume of 
interest-related assets 
and liabilities 
have 
 affected 
the Corporation s 
net interest 
income. For 
each category 
of interest-earning 
assets and 
interest-bearing 
liabilities, the 
tables 
 provide 
information 
on 
changes 
in 
(i) 
volume 
(changes 
in 
volume 
multiplied 
by 
prior 
period 
rates), 
and 
(ii) 
rate 
(changes 
in 
rate 
 multiplied by 
prior period 
volumes). The 
Corporation has 
allocated rate-volume 
variances (changes 
in rate 
multiplied by 
changes in 
 volume) to either the changes in volume 
or the changes in rate based upon the effect of each factor on the combined totals.

 On an adjusted tax-equivalent basis. The Corporation estimated the 
adjusted tax-equivalent yield by dividing the interest rate 
spread on exempt assets by 1 less the Puerto Rico statutory 
 tax rate of 37.5 and adding to it the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. 
The tax-equivalent adjustment recognizes the income tax savings when 
comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets. 
 Management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking 
industry to present net interest income, interest rate spread and 
net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis. 
 Therefore, management believes these measures provide useful information 
to investors by allowing them to make peer comparisons. 
The Corporation excludes changes in the fair value 
 of derivatives from interest income and interest expense 
because the changes in valuation do not affect interest received 
or paid. See "Basis of Presentation" below.

 Government obligations include debt issued by government-sponsored

 Portions of the Corporation s 
interest-earning assets, mostly investments 
in obligations of some U.S. 
government agencies and U.S. 
 GSEs, generate 
interest that 
is exempt 
from income 
tax, principally 
in Puerto 
Rico. Also, 
interest and 
gains on 
sales of 
investments 
 held 
by 
the 
Corporation s 
international 
banking 
entities IBEs 
are 
tax-exempt 
under 
Puerto 
Rico 
tax 
law 
(see 
Note 
22 
- 
Income 
 Taxes 
to 
the 
audited 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
included 
in 
Item 
8 
of 
this 
Form 
10-K). 
Management 
believes 
that 
the 
 presentation of interest income 
on an adjusted tax-equivalent 
basis facilitates the comparison 
of all interest data related 
to these assets. 
 The 
Corporation 
estimated 
the 
tax 
equivalent 
yield 
by 
dividing 
the 
interest 
rate 
spread 
on 
exempt 
assets 
by 
1 
less 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
 statutory 
tax 
rate 
(37.5 
and 
adding 
to 
it 
the 
average 
cost 
of 
interest-bearing 
liabilities. 
The 
computation 
considers 
the 
interest 
 expense disallowance required by Puerto Rico tax law. 

 Management 
believes 
that 
the 
presentation 
of 
net 
interest 
income 
excluding 
the 
effects 
of 
the 
changes 
in 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
the 
 derivative 
instruments valuations 
provides 
additional 
information 
about 
the 
Corporation s 
net 
interest 
income 
and 
facilitates 
 comparability and analysis from 
period to period. The changes 
in the fair value of 
the derivative instruments have 
no effect on interest 
 due on interest-bearing liabilities or interest earned on interest-earning 
assets.

 Net 
interest 
income 
amounted 
to 
 795.3 
million 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022, 
an 
increase 
of 
 65.4 
million, 
when 
 compared to 
 729.9 million 
for the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2021. 
The 65.4 
million increase 
in net 
interest income 
was primarily 
 due to: 
 
 A 31.1 million 
increase in interest income 
on consumer loans and 
finance leases, mainly due 
to a 371.7 million 
increase in 
 the average balance of this portfolio, mostly related to growth in the auto loans 
and finance leases portfolios. 

A 30.0 million increase in interest income on investment 
securities, driven by a decrease in the U.S. agencies MBS premium 
 amortization expense 
associated to lower 
prepayments as market 
interest rates increased 
during 2022. 
In addition, there 
was 
 an increase of 
approximately 8.6 million 
in interest income attributable 
to an 805.4 million 
increase in the average 
balance 
 of 
government 
obligations 
driven 
by 
the 
redeployment 
of 
some 
cash 
balances 
into 
higher-yielding 
liquid 
investment 
 securities. 

A 15.1 
million increase 
in interest 
income on 
commercial and 
construction 
loans, primarily 
reflecting higher 
interest rates 
 and higher 
loan balances 
(excluding SBA 
PPP loans). 
The effect 
associated with 
higher market 
interest rates, 
that included 
 the upward repricing 
of variable-rate commercial 
and construction 
loans and new 
loans originated at 
higher interest, 
resulted 
 in an 
increase of 
approximately 34.7 
million in 
interest income. 
In addition, 
there was 
an increase 
of approximately 
 57.1 
 million in 
the average 
balance of 
this portfolio 
(excluding SBA 
PPP loans), 
which resulted 
in an 
increase of 
approximately 
 2.0 
million 
in 
interest 
income. 
These 
favorable 
variances 
were 
partially 
offset 
by 
a 
 12.9 
million 
reduction 
in 
interest 
 income 
from 
SBA 
PPP 
loans, 
from 
 20.9 
million 
in 
2021 
to 
 8.0 
million 
in 
2022, 
a 
decrease 
of 
 6.7 
million 
in 
interest 
 income attributed to 
a lower discount accretion 
for the acquired BSPR commercial 
and construction loans, and 
a reduction of 
 approximately 
 2.9 
million 
related 
to 
the 
benefit 
of 
interest 
income 
realized 
from 
deferred 
interest 
recognized 
on 
a 
 construction loan paid off in 2021. 
 The 
interest 
rate 
on 
approximately 
56 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
commercial 
and 
construction 
loans 
is 
variable, 
42 
is based 
 upon 
LIBOR, 
SOFR and 
other 
indexes 
and 14 
is based 
upon 
the 
Prime rate 
index. 
During 2022, 
the average 
one-month 
 LIBOR 
increased 
182 
basis 
points, 
the 
average 
three-month 
LIBOR 
increased 
224 
basis 
points, 
the 
average 
Prime 
rate 
 increased 161 
basis points, and 
the average 
three-month SOFR increased 
215 basis points, 
compared to 
the average rates 
for 
 such indexes in 2021. 
 
 A 9.1 
million increase 
in interest 
income from 
interest-bearing cash 
balances, primarily 
consisting of 
cash balances 
held at 
 the 
FED, 
mainly 
due 
to 
the 
effects 
higher 
market 
interest 
rates, 
partially 
offset 
by 
the 
effects 
associated 
with 
an 
 856.5 
 million reduction in the average balance. 
 Partially offset by: 

A 17.5 
million decrease 
in interest income 
on residential 
mortgage loans, 
primarily related 
to a 390.5 
million reduction 
in 
 the average balance of this portfolio, partially offset by higher 
yields. 
 
 A 2.5 million increase in total interest expense, including: 
 o
 a 
 4.9 
million 
increase 
in 
interest 
expense 
on 
interest-bearing 
deposits, 
primarily 
associated 
with 
the 
effects 
of 
 higher 
interest 
rate 
environment 
on 
average 
rates 
paid 
in 
2022, 
partially 
offset 
by 
the 
effects 
of 
a 
 378.4 
million 
 reduction 
in the 
average balance 
of interest-bearing 
deposits reflecting 
the effect 
of customer 
allocating more 
cash 
 into higher yielding liquid alternative, as well as higher consumer spending; 

 o
 a 
 0.7 
million 
increase 
in 
interest 
expense 
on 
other 
borrowings, 
consisting 
of 
a 
 3.1 
million 
increase 
in 
interest 
 expense 
on 
variable-rate 
junior 
subordinated 
debentures 
that 
are 
tied 
to 
LIBOR, 
partially 
offset 
by 
a 
 2.4 
million 
 decrease in interest 
expense on repurchase 
agreements primarily related 
to a 105.5 million 
reduction in the 
average 
 balance; and 

 o
 a 3.1 
million decrease 
in interest 
expense on 
FHLB advances, 
primarily 
related to 
the effects 
of a 
 174.6 million 
 decrease in the average balance 
of FHLB advances, partially offset 
by the effects of higher 
market interest rates paid 
 on FHLB advances taken in 2022. 
 The net 
interest margin 
increased by 
39 basis 
points to 
4.12 for 
2022, 
compared to 
3.73 for 
2021. 
The improved 
margin 
was 
 primarily 
attributable 
to 
higher 
market 
interest 
rates 
driving 
an 
increase 
in 
loans, 
investment 
securities, 
and 
interest-earning 
cash 
 balance 
yields, 
partially 
offset 
by 
higher 
cost 
of 
funds, 
the 
impact 
of 
lower 
accelerated 
SBA 
PPP 
loan 
fees 
recognized 
upon 
 forgiveness payments in 2002, and lower purchase discount 
accretion as mentioned above.

 Provision for Credit Losses
 The provision 
for credit 
losses consists of 
provisions for 
credit losses on 
loans and 
finance leases, 
unfunded loan 
commitments, as 
 well as the debt securities portfolio. The principal changes in the provision for 
credit losses by main categories follow: 
 Provision for credit losses for 
loans and finance leases 
 The provision for 
credit losses for loans 
and finance leases was 
an expense of 25.7 
million for the year 
ended December 31, 2022, 
 compared to 
a net benefit 
of 61.7 
million for the 
year ended December 
31, 2021. 
The variances by 
major portfolio 
category were 
as 
 follows: 
 
 Provision for 
credit losses 
for the 
commercial and 
construction loan 
portfolio was 
a net benefit 
of 23.1 
million for 
the year 
 ended December 31, 2022, 
compared to a net benefit 
of 65.3 million for 
the year ended December 
31, 2021. The net benefit 
 recorded 
during 
2022 
mainly 
reflects 
reductions 
in 
qualitative 
reserves 
associated 
with 
reduced 
uncertainty 
around 
the 
 economic impact 
of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, 
particularly on 
loans in 
the hotel, 
transportation and 
entertainment industries, 
 partially offset 
by loan 
growth and 
a less favorable 
economic outlook 
in the 
projection of 
certain forecasted 
macroeconomic 
 variables, 
such 
as the 
commercial 
real 
estate CRE 
index. 
Meanwhile, 
the 
net 
benefit 
recorded 
in 2021 
reflects 
both 
an 
 improved 
broad 
macroeconomic 
environment 
following 
the 
initial 
impact 
of 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic 
and 
an 
overall 
 decrease in the size of this portfolio in the Puerto Rico region. 
 
 Provision for 
credit losses 
for the 
consumer loans 
and finance 
leases portfolio 
was an 
expense of 
 57.5 million 
for the 
year 
 ended December 
31, 2022, compared 
to 20.6 million 
for the year 
ended December 31, 
2021. The 
increase in charges 
to the 
 provision 
during 
2022 
was 
driven 
by 
the 
portfolio 
growth, 
uncertainties 
in 
the 
macroeconomic 
outlook 
reflected 
in 
the 
 deterioration in forecasted variables such as the regional unemployment 
rate, and higher net charge-offs. 
 
 Provision 
for 
credit 
losses 
for 
the 
residential 
mortgage 
loan 
portfolio 
was 
a 
net 
benefit 
of 
 8.7 
million 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
 December 
31, 
2022, 
compared 
to 
 17.0 
million 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2021. 
The 
net 
benefit 
in 
both 
periods 
 reflects the 
effect of 
a continued 
decrease in 
the size 
of the residential 
mortgage loan 
portfolio, 
as well 
as releases 
related to 
 qualitative adjustments 
associated with 
reduced uncertainty 
around the 
economic impact 
of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, 
while 
 also recognizing the uncertainty in the near-term macroeconomic 
outlook. 
 During 2022, 
the Corporation 
applied probability 
weights to 
the baseline 
and alternative 
downside economic 
scenarios 
to estimate 
 the ACL 
with the 
baseline scenario 
carrying the 
highest weight. 
For periods 
prior to 
2022, the 
Corporation calculated 
the ACL 
using 
 the baseline 
scenario. See

 Provision for credit losses for 
unfunded loan commitments 
 The provision 
for credit 
losses for 
unfunded 
commercial 
and construction 
loan commitments 
and standby 
letters of 
credit 
was an 
 expense of 2.7 million for 
the year ended December 31, 
2022, compared to a net benefit of 
 3.6 million for the year ended 
December 
 31, 2021. 
The expense 
recorded during 
2022 was 
mainly driven 
by an increase 
in balance 
of unfunded 
loan commitments 
principally 
 due to 
newly originated 
facilities which 
remained undrawn 
as of 
December 31, 
2022. On 
the other 
hand, the 
net benefit 
recorded in 
 2021 
was 
mainly 
related 
to 
improvements 
in 
forecasted 
macroeconomic 
variables 
following 
the 
initial 
impact 
of 
the 
COVID-19 
 pandemic. 
 Provision for credit losses for 
held-to-maturity and available-for-sale debt 
securities
 The 
provision 
for 
credit 
losses 
for 
held-to-maturity 
securities 
was 
a 
net 
benefit 
of 
 0.3 
million 
for 
each 
of 
the 
years 
ended 
 December 
31, 
2022 
and 
2021. 
The 
net 
benefit 
recorded 
during 
2022 
was 
mainly 
due 
to 
the 
Corporation s 
reduction 
in 
qualitative 
 reserves driven 
by improvements in 
the underlying 
financial information 
of certain bond 
issuers. Meanwhile, 
the net benefit 
recorded 
 in 
2021 
was 
mainly 
related 
to 
improvements 
in 
forecasted 
macroeconomic 
variables 
and 
the 
repayment 
of 
certain 
bonds, 
partially 
 offset by changes in some issuers financial metrics based on their most 
recent financial statements. 
 The 
provision for 
credit losses 
for 
available-for-sale 
debt 
securities was 
a net 
benefit of 
 0.4 million 
recorded for 
the year 
ended 
 December 31, 2022, compared to 0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 
2021. 

57 
 Non-Interest Income 
 Non-interest income 
amounted to 
 123.1 million 
for the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2022, compared 
to 121.2 
million for 
the same 
 period in 2021. The 1.9 million increase in non-interest income was primarily 
due to: 
 
 A 
 3.9 
million 
increase 
in 
credit 
and 
debit 
cards, 
point 
of 
sale POS 
and 
merchant 
fee 
income 
reflecting 
increased 
 purchase and transaction volumes. 
 
 A 
 3.4 
million 
increase 
in 
other 
sources 
of 
non-interest 
income 
including: 
(i) 
a 
 2.0 
million 
increase 
related 
to 
higher 
 benefit recognized 
in relation 
to purchased 
income tax 
credits realized 
during the 
year; (ii) 
a 1.5 
million increase 
in fees 
 and commissions from 
insurance referrals; and 
(iii) a 0.9 million 
increase in gains 
related to the 
sale of long-lived 
assets. 
 These variances were partially offset by a 0.4 million 
increase in unrealized losses on marketable equity securities and the 
 effect 
in 
2021 
of 
a 
 0.6 
million 
gain 
recorded 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
settlement 
and 
collection 
of 
an 
insurance 
claim 
 associated with a damaged property. 
 
 A 2.5 
million increase 
in service 
charges and 
fees on 
deposit accounts, 
mainly due 
to an 
increase in 
the number 
of cash 
 management transactions of commercial clients and an increase in the monthly 
service fee charged on certain checking and 
 savings products 
which was 
effective in 
the third 
quarter of 
2021, partially 
offset by 
a 0.7 
million adjustment 
during the 
 fourth 
quarter 
of 
2022 
to 
reverse 
previously 
recognized 
fees 
on 
non-sufficient 
funds 
as 
part 
of 
changes 
in 
the 
fees 
 structure. 
 
 A 1.8 million increase in insurance commission income. 
 Partially offset by: 
 
 A 9.7 
million decrease 
in revenues 
from mortgage 
banking activities, 
mainly driven 
by an 
 11.8 
million decrease 
in net 
 realized gain 
on sales 
of residential 
mortgage loans 
in the 
secondary market 
mainly due 
to a 
lower volume 
of sales 
and a 
 1.1 million 
decrease 
in servicing 
fees. These 
variances 
were partially 
offset 
by a 
 2.2 million 
decrease in 
the mortgage 
 servicing rights 
amortization expense, 
net of recoveries, 
resulting from 
reduced prepayment 
rates. During 
2022 and 
2021, 
 net gains of 
 8.4 million and 
 20.2 million, respectively, 
were recognized as a 
result of GNMA 
securitization transactions 
 and whole loan sales to U.S. GSEs amounting to 238.3 million and 518.9 
million, respectively.

 Non-Interest Expenses 
 Non-interest expenses for 
the year ended 
December 31, 2022 were 
 443.1 million, compared 
to 489.0 million 
for the same period 
 in 2021. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding 26.4 million in merger 
and restructuring costs associated with the acquisition of BSPR and 
 costs of 
 3.0 million 
related to 
the COVID-19 
pandemic response 
efforts which 
were recognized 
during 2021, 
non-interest expenses 
 decreased 
by 
 16.5 
million 
when 
compared 
with 
adjusted 
non-interest 
expenses 
in 
2021. 
See 
 Special 
Items 
above 
for 
additional 
 information. Some of the most significant variances in adjusted non 
-interest expenses were as follows: 

A 
 12.1 
million 
decrease 
in 
adjusted 
professional 
service 
fees, 
driven 
by 
an 
 11.2 
million 
decrease 
in 
outsourcing 
 technology 
service 
fees, 
mainly 
associated 
with 
the 
effect 
in 
2021 
of 
both 
approximately 
 7.0 
million 
of 
temporary 
 processing 
costs 
incurred 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
acquired 
BSPR 
operations 
prior 
to 
system 
conversions 
and 
costs 
of 
 approximately 1.5 
million incurred 
in connection 
with the 
platform used 
for SBA 
PPP loan 
originations and 
forgiveness 
 funding. 
 
 A 
 4.8 
million 
decrease 
in adjusted 
other 
non-interest expenses 
including: 
(i) a 
 2.6 
million 
decrease 
in amortization 
of 
 intangible 
assets mainly 
associated 
with 
the 
purchased 
credit card 
relationship 
intangible asset 
recognized 
in connection 
 with the 
acquisition of 
a FirstBank-branded 
credit card 
loan portfolio 
in 2012 
which became fully 
amortized at 
the end of 
 2021; 
and (ii) 
a 2.6 
million 
decrease 
in charges 
for 
legal and 
operational 
reserves, 
in part 
due 
to the 
reversal 
of a 
 1.0 
 million reserve upon resolution of an operational loss during the second quarter 
of 2022. 

A 3.6 
million increase 
in net 
gains on 
OREO operation 
s, primarily 
reflecting: (i) 
a 2.3 
million increase 
in net 
realized 
 gains on 
sales of 
OREO properties, 
primarily residential 
properties in 
the Puerto 
Rico region; 
(ii) a 
 1.9 million 
decrease 
 in 
OREO-related 
operating 
expenses, 
primarily 
taxes, 
repairs 
and 
insurance; 
and 
(iii) 
a 
 1.6 
million 
decrease 
in 
write-
 downs 
to 
the 
value 
of 
OREO 
properties. 
These 
variances 
were 
partially 
offset 
by 
a 
 2.2 
million 
decrease 
in 
income 
 recognized 
from 
rental 
payments 
mainly 
associated 
to 
the 
disposition 
in 
2021 
of 
a 
large 
OREO 
income-producing 
 property. 
 
 A 
 2.4 
million 
decrease 
in 
adjusted 
occupancy 
and 
equipment 
expenses, 
primarily 
related 
to 
a 
reduction 
in 
equipment-
 related depreciation charges and rental expenses, partially 
offset by higher energy costs. 
 
 A 
 1.6 
million 
decrease 
in 
adjusted 
taxes, 
other 
than 
income 
taxes, 
primarily 
related 
to 
lower 
sales 
and 
use 
taxes, 
 municipal license taxes, and property taxes. 
 Partially offset by: 
 
 A 
 5.6 
million 
increase 
in 
adjusted 
employees 
compensation 
and 
benefits 
expenses, 
primarily 
reflecting 
a 
 3.0 
million 
 decrease in 
deferred loan 
origination costs 
mainly driven 
by the 
effect of 
SBA PPP 
loan originations 
closed during 
2021, 
 as well as the effect of annual salary merit increases and higher medical 
insurance premium costs. 
 
 A 
 2.9 million 
increase in adjusted 
business promotion 
expenses, mainly 
related to 
a 0.8 million 
increase in 
sponsorship 
 and public relations activities and 
a 0.6 million increase 
in donations expense, of which 0.3 
million were granted to non-
 profit organizations in the municipalities most affected 
by Hurricane Fiona. 
 Income Taxes 
 For 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
recorded 
an 
income 
tax 
expense 
of 
 142.5 
million 
compared 
to 
 146.8 
 million in 
2021. The 
decrease in 
income tax 
expense for 
2022, as 
compared to 
2021, was 
related to 
a higher 
proportion of 
exempt to 
 taxable income resulting in a lower effective tax rate, 
partially offset by higher pre-tax income. 
 The Corporation s 
effective 
tax rate 
in the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2022, excluding 
entities from 
which a 
tax benefit 
cannot be 
 recognized 
and 
discrete 
items, 
was 
31.2 , 
compared 
to 
33.9 
for 
2021.

 OPERATING SEGMENTS
 Based 
upon 
the 
Corporation s 
organizational 
structure 
and 
the 
information 
provided 
to 
the 
Chief 
Executive 
Officer 
of 
the 
 Corporation, 
the operating 
segments are 
based primarily 
on the 
Corporation s 
lines of 
business for 
its operations 
in Puerto 
Rico, the 
 Corporation s 
principal 
market, 
and 
by 
geographic 
areas 
for 
its 
operations 
outside 
of 
Puerto 
Rico. 
As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
 Corporation 
had 
six 
reportable 
segments: 
Commercial 
and 
Corporate 
Banking; 
Consumer 
(Retail) 
Banking; 
Mortgage 
Banking; 
 Treasury and Investments; 
United States Operations; and Virgin 
Islands Operations. 
Management determined the reportable 
segments 
 based 
on 
the 
internal 
structure 
used 
to 
evaluate 
performance 
and 
to 
assess 
where 
to 
allocate 
resources. 
Other 
factors, 
such 
as 
the 
 Corporation s 
organizational 
chart, 
nature 
of 
the 
products, 
distribution 
channels, 
and 
the 
economic 
characteristics 
of 
the 
products, 
 were also considered in the determination of the reportable 
segments. For additional information regarding First BanCorp. s 
reportable 
 segments, please 
refer to 
Note 27 
- Segment 
Information, to 
the audited 
consolidated financial 
statements included 
in Item 
8 of 
this 
 Form 10-K. 
 The accounting policies of the segments are the same as 
those described in Note 1 - Nature of 
Business and Summary of Significant 
 Accounting Policies, to the 
audited consolidated financial 
statements included in Item 
8 of this Form 10-K. 
The Corporation evaluates 
 the 
performance 
of 
the 
segments 
based 
on net 
interest 
income, 
the 
provision 
for 
credit losses, 
non-interest 
income, 
and 
direct 
non-
 interest expenses. The 
segments are also evaluated 
based on the 
average volume of 
their interest-earning assets, 
less the ACL. 
For the 
 years ended December 
31, 2022 and 
2021, other operating 
expenses not 
allocated to a 
particular segment 
amounted to 155.3 
million 
 and 192.2 million, 
respectively. 
Expenses pertaining to 
corporate administrative functions 
that support the 
operating segment but 
are 
 not specifically attributable to or managed 
by any segment, are not included in 
the reported financial results of the operating 
segments. 
 The 
unallocated 
corporate 
expenses 
include 
certain 
general 
and 
administrative 
expenses 
and 
related 
depreciation 
and 
amortization 
 expenses. 
 The 
Treasury 
and 
Investments 
segment 
lends 
funds 
to 
the 
Consumer 
(Retail) 
Banking, 
Mortgage 
Banking, 
Commercial 
and 
 Corporate 
Banking and 
United States 
Operations 
segments to 
finance their 
lending activities 
and borrows 
from those 
segments. The 
 Consumer 
(Retail) 
Banking 
segment 
also 
lends 
funds 
to 
other 
segments. 
The 
Corporation 
allocates 
the 
interest 
rates 
charged 
or 
 credited by the 
Treasury and 
Investment and the 
Consumer (Retail) Banking 
segments based on 
market rates. The 
difference between 
 the 
allocated 
interest 
income 
or 
expense 
and 
the 
Corporation s 
actual 
net 
interest 
income 
from 
centralized 
management 
of 
funding 
 costs is reported in the Treasury and Investments segment 
. 

60 
 Commercial and Corporate Banking
 The 
Commercial 
and 
Corporate 
Banking 
segment 
consists 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
lending 
and 
other 
services 
for 
large 
customers 
 represented by 
specialized and 
middle-market clients 
and the 
public sector. 
The Commercial 
and Corporate 
Banking segment 
offers 
 commercial 
loans, including 
commercial real 
estate and 
construction loans, 
as well 
as other 
products, such 
as cash 
management 
and 
 business management 
services. A 
substantial portion 
of the 
commercial and 
corporate banking 
portfolio is 
secured by 
the underlying 
 real estate 
collateral 
and 
the personal 
guarantees 
of the 
borrowers. Since 
commercial 
loans involve 
greater 
credit risk 
than 
a typical 
 residential mortgage 
loan because 
they are 
larger in 
size and 
more risk 
is concentrated 
in a 
single borrower, 
the Corporation 
has and 
 maintains a credit 
risk management infrastructure 
designed to mitigate 
potential losses associated 
with commercial 
lending, including 
 underwriting and loan review functions, sales of loan participations, and 
continuous monitoring of concentrations within portfolios. 
 The highlights 
of the 
Commercial and 
Corporate Banking 
segment s 
financial results 
for the 
years ended 
December 31, 
2022 and 
 2021 include the following: 
 
 Segment 
income before 
taxes for 
the year 
ended December 
31, 2022 
decreased to 
 111.1 
million, compared 
to 239.3 
 million for 2021, for the reasons discussed below. 
 
 Net 
interest 
income 
for 
the year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022 
was 109.8 
million, 
compared 
to 191.9 
million 
for 2021. 

 The decrease 
in net 
interest income 
was primarily 
attributable 
to an 
increase 
in the 
cost of 
funds borrowed 
from other 
 segments, resulting from higher 
market interest rates, partially 
offset by an increased 
average balance of commercial 
and 
 constructions loans and the upward repricing of variable-rate commercial 
and construction loans during 2022. 

For 2022, the provision for credit losses was a net benefit 
of 20.2 million, compared to a net benefit of 
 67.5 million for 
 2021. 
The 
net 
benefit 
recorded 
during 
2022 
mainly 
reflects 
reductions 
in 
qualitative 
reserves 
associated 
with 
reduced 
 uncertainty 
around 
the 
economic 
impact 
of 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic, 
particularly 
on 
loans in 
the hotel, 
transportation 
 and entertainment 
industries, partially 
offset by 
loan growth 
and a 
less favorable 
economic outlook 
in the 
projection of 
 certain 
forecasted 
macroeconomic 
variables, 
such 
as 
the 
commercial 
real 
estate 
index. 
Meanwhile, 
the 
net 
benefit 
 recorded 
in 
2021 
reflects 
both 
an 
improved 
broad 
macroeconomic 
environment 
following 
the 
initial 
impact 
of 
the 
 COVID-19 pandemic and an overall decrease in the size of this portfolio in the Puerto Rico 
region. 

Total 
non-interest income 
for the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2022 amounted 
to 18.2 
million compared 
to 16.0 
million 
 for 
2021. 
The increase 
in non-interest 
income 
was mainly 
related 
to a 
combination of 
the following; 
i) a 
 0.7 million 
 increase in service charges 
on deposits, primarily related 
to cash management fee income 
from corporate customers; ii) 
a 
 0.5 
million 
increase 
in 
foreign 
currency 
exchange 
commission 
income; 
iii) 
a 
 0.4 
million 
increase 
from 
merchant-
 related income and iv) a benefit of approximately 0.3 million related 
income tax credits purchased and realized in 2022. 

Direct non-interest 
expenses for 
the year 
ended December 
31, 2022 
were 37.1 
million, compared 
to 36.2 
million for 
 2021. 
The increase 
is mainly 
driven by 
an increase 
of 2.6 
million in 
employees compensation 
and benefits 
expenses, 
 primarily reflecting 
the effects 
of salary 
annual merit 
increases and 
a decrease 
in deferred 
loan origination 
costs mainly 
 driven 
by 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
SBA 
PPP 
loans 
that 
were 
originated 
in 
2021. 
Partially 
offsetting 
this 
increase 
is 
a 
 2.0 
 million 
reduction 
in 
professional 
service 
fees, 
primarily 
associated 
with 
the 
effects 
in 
2021 
of 
expenses 
incurred 
in 
 connection with the platform used for SBA PPP loan originations and 
forgiveness funding. 

61 
 Consumer (Retail) Banking
 The 
Consumer 
(Retail) 
Banking 
segment 
consists 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
consumer 
lending 
and 
deposit-taking 
activities 
conducted 
 mainly 
through 
FirstBank s 
branch 
network 
and 
loan 
centers 
in 
Puerto 
Rico. 
Loans 
to 
consumers 
include 
auto, 
boat, 
and 
personal 
 loans, credit 
card loans, 
and lines 
of credit. 
Deposit products 
include interest-bearing 
and non-interest-bearing 
checking and 
savings 
 accounts, individual 
retirement accounts IRAs ), and 
retail CDs. 
Retail deposits 
gathered through 
each branch 
of FirstBank s 
retail 
 network serve as one of the funding sources for the lending and investment activities. 
 Consumer lending 
historically has 
been mainly 
driven by 
auto loan 
and leases 
originations. The 
Corporation follows 
a strategy 
of 
 seeking 
to 
provide 
outstanding 
service 
to 
selected 
auto 
dealers 
that 
provide 
the 
channel for 
the 
bulk 
of 
the Corporation s 
auto 
loan 
 originations. 

 Personal 
loans, credit 
cards, 
and, 
to a 
lesser extent, 
boat 
loans also 
contribute 
to interest 
income 
generated 
on consumer 
lending. 
 Management 
plans 
to 
continue 
to 
be 
active 
in 
the 
consumer 
loan 
market, 
applying 
the 
Corporation s 
strict 
underwriting 
standards. 
 Other activities included in this segment are insurance activities in the Puerto 
Rico region. 
 The 
highlights 
of 
the 
Consumer 
(Retail) 
Banking 
segment s 
financial 
results 
for 
the 
years 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022 
and 
2021 
 include the following: 
 
 Segment 
income before 
taxes for 
the year 
ended December 
31, 2022 
increased 
to 301.3 
million, 
compared 
to 165.8 
 million for 2021, for the reasons discussed below. 
 
 Net 
interest 
income 
for 
the year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022 
was 442.6 
million, 
compared 
to 281.7 
million 
for 2021. 

 The 
increase 
was 
mainly 
due 
to 
higher 
income 
from 
funds 
loaned 
to 
other 
business 
segments 
resulting 
from 
higher 
 market interest 
rates. In 
addition, the 
average volume 
of consumer 
loans in 
the Puerto 
Rico region 
increased by 
 375.8 
 million, 
mainly 
in the 
auto 
loans and 
finance 
leases portfolios. 
These 
variances 
were 
partially offset 
by 
an increase 
in 
 average rates paid to consumer customer deposits. 
 
 The 
provision 
for 
credit 
losses 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022 
increased 
by 
 36.8 
million 
to 
 57.1 
million, 
 compared to 20.3 
million for the 
year ended December 
31, 2021. 
The increase in the 
provision during 
2022 was driven 
 by the portfolio 
growth, uncertainties in the 
macroeconomic outlook 
reflected in the 
deterioration in forecasted 
variables 
 such as the regional unemployment rate, and higher net charge-offs. 

Non-interest income for the 
year ended December 31, 
2022 was 78.5 million, 
compared to 69.8 million 
for 2021. 
The 
 increase 
was 
primarily 
related 
to 
a 
 3.0 
million 
increase 
in 
credit 
and 
debit 
cards, 
POS 
and 
merchant 
fee 
income 
 reflecting increased 
purchase and transaction 
volumes, as well 
as an increase 
of 1.8 million 
in service charges 
and fees 
 on deposits primarily 
related to an 
increase in the 
monthly service fee 
charged on 
certain checking and 
savings products 
 which was effective 
in the third quarter 
of 2021. 
Also reflected in 
this variance are 
a 1.6 million 
increase on insurance 
 commission 
income 
and 
a 
benefit 
of 
 1.2 
million 
allocated 
to 
the 
Consumer 
(Retail) 
Banking 
segment 
in 
relation 
to 
 income tax credits purchased and realized in 2022. 

Direct non-interest expenses for 
the year ended December 
31, 2022 were 162.7 million, 
compared to 165.4 million 
for 
 2021. 
The decrease 
was primarily 
related to 
a 3.8 
million reduction 
in occupancy 
and equipment 
expenses driven 
by 
 cost savings 
achieved subsequent 
to the 
closure and 
consolidation of 
branches in 
accordance with 
the BSPR 
acquisition 
 integration and 
restructuring plan, 
in particular rental 
and depreciation 
expense. In 
addition, contributing 
to the decrease 
 is 
a 
 2.0 
million 
reduction 
in 
professional 
service 
fees, 
mainly 
associated 
with 
the 
effects 
in 
2021 
of 
temporary 
 processing 
costs 
incurred 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
acquired 
BSPR 
operations 
prior 
to 
systems 
conversion, 
and 
a 
 2.5 
 million reduction in the amortization expense of the purchased credit card 
relationship intangible recognized in the BSPR 
 acquisition. 
These variances were partially offset 
by an increase of 4.5 million in 
employees compensation and benefit 
 expenses, primarily reflecting the effects of salary 
annual merit increases. 

62 
 Mortgage Banking
 The Mortgage Banking 
segment conducts its operations 
mainly through FirstBank. 
The Mortgage Banking 
segment consists of the 
 origination, sale, and 
servicing of a variety 
of residential mortgage loan 
products. Originations are 
sourced through different 
channels, 
 such 
as 
FirstBank 
branches 
and 
purchases 
from 
mortgage 
bankers, 
and 
in 
association 
with 
new 
project 
developers. 
The 
mortgage 
 banking segment 
focuses on 
originating 
residential real 
estate loans, 
some of 
which conform 
to the 
Federal Housing 
Administration 
 (the 
 FHA ), 
the 
Veterans 
Administration 
(the 
 VA ), 
and 
U.S. 
Department 
of 
Agriculture 
Rural 
Development RD 
standards. 
 Loans originated that meet 
the FHA s 
standards qualify for 
the FHA s 
insurance program whereas loans 
that meet the standards 
of the 
 VA 
or the RD are guaranteed by their respective federal agencies. 
 Mortgage 
loans that 
do not 
qualify under 
the FHA, 
VA, 
or RD 
programs 
are referred 
to as 
conventional 
loans. Conventional 
real 
 estate loans can 
be conforming or 
non-conforming. 
Conforming loans are 
residential real estate 
loans that meet 
the standards for 
sale 
 under 
the 
U.S. 
Federal 
National 
Mortgage 
Association FNMA 
and 
the 
U.S. 
Federal 
Home 
Loan 
Mortgage 
Corporation 
 FHLMC programs. 
Loans that 
do not 
meet FNMA 
or FHLMC 
standards are 
referred to 
as non-conforming 
residential real 
estate 
 loans. The Mortgage 
Banking segment also acquires 
and sells mortgages 
in the secondary 
markets. Residential real 
estate conforming 
 loans are sold to investors like FNMA and FHLMC. 
The Corporation has commitment authority to issue GNMA MBS. 
 The highlights 
of the 
Mortgage Banking 
segment s 
financial results 
for the 
years ended 
December 31, 
2022 and 
2021 include 
the 
 following: 
 
 Segment 
income 
before 
taxes 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022 
decreased 
to 
 99.5 
million, 
compared 
to 
 115.8 
 million for 2021, for the reasons discussed below. 
 
 Net interest income for 
the year ended December 
31, 2022 was 98.9 
million, compared to 
 104.6 million for 2021. 
The 
 decrease in 
net interest 
income was 
mainly due 
the decrease 
in the 
average balance 
of residential 
mortgage loans 
in the 
 Puerto Rico region. 
 
 The provision 
for credit losses 
for 2022 was 
a net benefit 
of 7.6 million, 
compared to a 
net benefit of 
 16.0 million for 
 2021. 
The net 
benefit in 
both periods 
reflects the 
effect 
of a 
continued 
decrease in 
the size 
of the 
residential 
mortgage 
 loan 
portfolio 
as 
well 
as 
releases 
related 
to 
qualitative 
adjustments 
associated 
with 
reduced 
uncertainty 
around 
the 
 economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
 Non-interest income for the 
year ended December 31, 
2022 was 16.0 million, 
compared to 24.3 million 
for 2021. 
The 
 decrease was mainly 
driven by a 
 10.2 million decrease 
in net realized gain 
on sales of residential 
mortgage loans in 
the 
 secondary market 
mainly due 
to a 
lower volume 
of sales, 
and a 
 0.6 million 
decrease in 
servicing fee 
income, partially 
 offset by 
a 2.2 million 
decrease in mortgage 
servicing rights amortization 
expense resulting 
from reduced 
prepayments 
 rates. 
 
 Direct non-interest 
expenses for 
the year 
ended December 
31, 2022 
were 23.0 
million, compared 
to 29.1 
million for 
 2021. 
The decrease 
was mainly 
related to 
a 4.1 
million increase 
in gains 
on OREO 
operations, primarily 
higher gains 
 realized on the sale of residential OREO properties.

 Treasury and 
Investments
 The 
Treasury 
and 
Investments 
segment 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
Corporation s 
treasury 
and 
investment 
management 
functions. 
The 
 treasury function, which 
includes funding and 
liquidity management, lends 
funds to the 
Commercial and Corporate 
Banking segment, 
 the Mortgage 
Banking segment, 
the Consumer 
(Retail) Banking 
segment, and 
the United 
States Operations 
segment to 
finance their 
 respective lending 
activities and 
borrows from 
those segments. 
The Treasury 
function also 
obtains funds 
through brokered 
deposits, 
 advances from the FHLB, and repurchase agreements involving investment 
securities, among other possible funding sources. 
 The investment function is intended to implement a leverage strategy for the 
purposes of liquidity management, interest rate risk 
 management and earnings enhancement. 
 The interest rates charged or credited by Treasury 
and Investments are based on market rates. 
 The 
highlights 
of 
the 
Treasury 
and 
Investments 
segment s 
financial 
results 
for 
the 
years 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022 
and 
2021 
 include the following: 
 
 Segment 
income 
before 
taxes 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022 
decreased 
to 
 36.3 
million, 
compared 
to 
 55.6 
 million for 2021, for the reasons discussed below. 
 
 Net interest 
income for 
the year ended 
December 31, 
2022 was 39.6 
million, compared 
to net 
interest income 
of 59.3 
 million for 
2021. 
The decrease 
was mainly 
related to 
a net 
transfer pricing 
charge of 
 43.8 million 
recognized in 
2022 
 associated 
to 
the 
cost 
of 
funds 
borrowed 
from 
the 
Consumer 
(Retail) 
Banking 
segment, 
as 
compared 
to 
a 
net 
transfer 
 pricing credit of 14.7 million 
recognized in 2021 from funds 
loaned to other business segments. 
This variance is mainly 
 driven by the 
effects of a 
higher volume of 
investments securities funded 
by demand deposits gathered 
by the Consumer 
 (Retail) Banking operating segment as well as higher market interest rates. 

Non-interest 
loss 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022 
was 
 0.1 
million, 
compared 
to 
non-interest 
income 
of 
 0.2 
 million 
for 
2021. 
The 
variance primarily 
reflects 
the 
effect 
of 
a 
 0.4 
million 
decrease 
in the 
fair 
value 
of 
marketable 
 equity securities recorded through earnings. 

Direct non-interest expenses for 
2022 were 3.7 million, compared 
to 4.1 million for 2021. 
The decrease was primarily 
 reflected in employees compensation expense and professional service 
fees. 

64 
 United States Operations
 The United 
States Operations 
segment 
consists of 
all banking 
activities conducted 
by FirstBank 
on the 
U.S. mainland. 
FirstBank 
 provides a 
wide range 
of banking 
services to 
individual and 
corporate customers 
primarily in 
southern Florida 
through nine 
banking 
 branches. 
The United 
States Operations 
segment 
offers 
an array 
of both 
consumer 
and commercial 
banking 
products 
and 
services. 
 Consumer banking 
products include 
checking, savings 
and money 
market accounts, 
retail CDs, 
internet banking 
services, residential 
 mortgages, and 
home equity 
loans and 
lines of 
credit. Retail 
deposits, as 
well as 
FHLB advances 
and brokered 
CDs, allocated 
to this 
 operation serve as funding sources for its lending activities. 
 Commercial 
banking 
services 
include 
checking, 
savings 
and 
money 
market 
accounts, 
retail 
CDs, 
internet 
banking 
services, 
cash 
 management services, remote data capture, 
and automated clearing house ACH 
transactions. 
Loan products include the traditional 
 C I and commercial real estate products, such as lines of credit, term loans, 
and construction loans. 
 The highlights of the 
United States operations segment s 
financial results for the years 
ended December 31, 2022 
and 2021, include 
 the following: 
 
 Segment 
income 
before 
taxes 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022 
increased 
to 
 53.1 
million, 
compared 
to 
 37.0 
 million for 2021, for the reasons discussed below. 
 
 Net interest income 
for the year 
ended December 31, 
2022 was 80.5 
million, compared to 
 66.0 million for 
2021. 
The 
 increase was 
mainly related 
to higher 
interest rates, 
that include 
the effect 
of both 
the upward 
repricing of 
variable-rate 
 commercial 
and 
construction 
loans 
and 
new 
loans 
originated 
at 
higher 
rates, 
as 
well 
as 
higher 
average 
loan 
balances 
 (excluding SBA PPP loans). 
 
 For 2022, 
the provision 
for credit 
losses was 
a net 
benefit of 
 3.1 million, 
compared to 
a net benefit 
of 1.0 
million for 
 2021. 
The 
higher 
benefit 
recorded 
in 
2022 
mainly 
reflects 
reductions 
in 
qualitative 
reserves 
associated 
with 
reduced 
 uncertainty around the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
partially offset by loan growth. 
 
 Total non 
-interest income for the year 
ended December 31, 2022 
amounted to 2.9 million, 
compared to 4.0 million 
for 
 2021. 
The decrease was primarily 
related to a 
 1.3 million decline in 
revenues from mortgage 
banking activities mainly 
 due 
to 
lower volume 
of 
sales and 
lower servicing 
fee 
income, partially 
offset 
by a 
 0.3 million 
increase 
in other 
non-
 deferrable loan fees. 

Direct non-interest 
expenses for 
the year 
ended December 
31, 2022 
were 33.4 
million, compared 
to 33.9 
million for 
 2021. 
The 
decrease 
was 
mainly 
due 
to 
reductions 
in 
professional 
service 
fees, 
employee 
compensation 
expenses, 
and 
 taxes other than income taxes, partially offset by increased business promotion 
expenses. 

65 
 Virgin 
Islands Operations
 The Virgin 
Islands Operations 
segment consists 
of all 
banking activities 
conducted by 
FirstBank in 
the USVI 
and BVI, 
including 
 consumer 
and commercial 
banking 
services, 
with 
a total 
of eight 
banking 
branches 
currently 
serving 
the islands 
in 
the USVI 
of St. 
 Thomas, 
St. 
Croix, 
and 
St. 
John, 
and 
the 
island 
of 
Tortola 
in 
the 
BVI. 
The 
Virgin 
Islands 
Operations 
segment 
is 
driven 
by 
its 
 consumer, commercial lending, and deposit 
-taking activities. 

 Loans 
to 
consumers 
include 
auto 
and 
boat 
loans, 
lines 
of 
credit, 
and 
personal 
and 
residential 
mortgage 
loans. 
Deposit 
products 
 include 
interest-bearing 
and 
non-interest-bearing 
checking 
and 
savings 
accounts, 
IRAs, 
and 
retail 
CDs. 
Retail 
deposits 
gathered 
 through each branch serve as the funding sources for its own lending activities. 
 The 
highlights 
of 
the 
Virgin 
Islands 
operations 
financial 
results 
for 
the 
years 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022 
and 
2021 
include 
the 
 following: 
 
 Segment income before taxes 
for the year ended December 
31, 2022 decreased to 1.7 
million, compared to 6.5 million 
 for 2021, for the reasons discussed below. 
 
 Net interest income 
for the year 
ended December 31, 
2022 was 23.8 
million, compared to 
 26.4 million for 
2021. 
The 
 decrease in net 
interest income was mainly 
related to a 
 44.0 million decrease 
in the average 
balance of commercial 
and 
 construction loans 
(excluding SBA 
PPP loans), 
a 20.0 
million decrease 
in the 
average balance 
of residential 
mortgage 
 loans and a reduction of 1.0 million in interest income from SBA PPP loans. 

The 
Corporation 
recognized 
a 
provision 
for 
credit 
losses 
of 
 2.0 
million 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022, 
 compared 
to 
a 
net 
benefit 
of 
 1.3 
million 
for 
2021. 
The 
provision 
recorded 
during 
2022 
was 
primarily 
related 
to 
 consumer 
loans 
reflecting 
the 
effects 
of 
loan 
growth, 
higher 
delinquency 
and 
charge-off 
levels, 
and 
a 
less 
favorable 
 outlook of certain macroeconomic variables. 

Non-interest 
income for 
the year 
ended December 
31, 2022 
was 7.7 
million, compared 
to 6.9 
million for 
2021. 
The 
 increase 
was 
primarily 
related 
to 
a 
 0.4 
million 
increase 
in 
fee-based 
income 
from 
credit 
and 
debit 
cards, 
POS 
and 
 merchant transactions, and a 0.3 million increase in income from insurance 
commissions. 

Direct non 
-interest expens 
es for 
the year 
ended December 
31, 
2022 were 
 27.9 
million compared 
to 28.1 
million 
for 
 2021. 
The decrease mainly reflects 
the effect of 
accelerated depreciation charges 
in 2021 related to 
the closing of certain 
 branches in the Virgin 
Islands region, partially offset by an increase in employees 
compensation expenses.

 The Corporation s 
total average assets 
were 19.4 
billion for the 
year ended December 
31, 2022, compared 
to 20.3 billion 
for the 
 year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2021, 
a 
net 
decrease 
of 
 924.4 
million. 
The 
variance 
primarily 
reflects 
the 
following: 
(i) 
a 
decrease 
of 
 856.5 
million 
in 
the 
average 
of 
interest-bearing 
cash 
balances, 
which 
consisted 
primarily 
of 
deposits 
maintained 
at 
the 
Federal 
 Reserve Bank; (ii) 
a decrease of 
 642.1 million 
in non-interest-earning 
assets mainly related 
to unrealized losses 
on available-for-sale 
 debt securities attributable 
to changes in market 
interest rates; and (iii) 
a 214.1 million decrease 
in the average balance 
of total loans, 
 primarily 
reflecting 
the 
overall 
decrease 
in 
the 
residential 
mortgage 
loan 
portfolio 
as 
paydowns 
exceeded 
originations, 
and 
the 
 decrease 
of 
the 
SBA 
PPP 
loan 
portfolio, 
partially 
offset 
by 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
average 
balance 
of 
auto 
loans 
and 
finance 
leases 
 portfolios. 
These 
variances 
were 
partially 
offset 
by 
an 
increase 
of 
 805.4 
million 
in 
the 
average 
balance 
of 
U.S. 
and 
Puerto 
Rico 
 government obligations mainly driven by the deployment of certain 
cash balances into U.S. agencies debt securities. 
 The Corporation s 
total average 
liabilities were 
 17.7 billion 
as of December 
31, 2022, 
a net decrease 
of 321.4 
million compared 
 to December 
31, 
2021. 
The net 
decrease 
was mainly 
related 
to a 
 378.4 
million 
decrease in 
the average 
balance 
of interest-bearing 
 deposits reflecting 
the effect 
of customers 
allocating more 
cash into 
higher yielding 
liquid alternatives 
as well 
as elevated 
consumer 
 spending, 
and 
a 
 279.7 
million 
decrease 
in 
the 
average 
balance 
of 
borrowings 
mainly 
driven 
by 
the 
repayment 
of 
long-term 
debt 
 during 
2022. 
These 
variances 
were 
partially 
offset 
by 
a 
 336.7 
million 
increase 
in 
the 
average 
balance 
of 
non-interest-bearing 
 liabilities, primarily non-interest-bearing deposits.
 Assets

The Corporation s 
total assets were 18.6 billion as of 
December 31, 2022, a decrease of 2.2 
billion from December 31, 2021. 
The 
 decrease 
was primarily 
related 
to 
a 2.1 
billion 
decrease 
in cash 
and 
cash 
equivalents mainly 
attributable 
to 
the overall 
decrease 
in 
 total deposits, 
the repurchase 
of approximately 
19.4 million 
shares of 
common stock 
for a total 
purchase price 
of 275.0 
million, and 
 the funding 
of new loan 
originations. 
This decrease 
in cash 
and cash equivalents 
was partially 
offset by 
a 250.1 
million net increase 
 in borrowings. 
In addition, 
total investment 
securities decreased 
by 571.4 
million, mainly 
related to 
the decrease 
in the fair 
value of 
 available-for-sale debt securities and 
repayments, partially offset by 
purchases of U.S. agencies and 
MBS. As further discussed below, 
 these variances were partially offset by a 469.3 million 
increase in total loans. 

68 
 Loans Receivable, including Loans Held for Sale 
 As of 
December 31, 
2022, the 
Corporation s 
total loan 
portfolio before 
the ACL 
amounted to 
 11.6 
billion, an 
increase of 
 469.3 
 million compared to December 
31, 2021. The growth reflects increases 
of 341.6 million in the Puerto 
Rico region and 139.6 million 
 in 
the 
Florida 
region, 
partially 
offset 
by 
a 
decrease 
of 11.9 
million 
in 
the 
Virgin 
Islands region. 
On 
a 
portfolio 
basis, 
the 
increase 
 consisted of a 439.5 
million increase in consumer 
loans, including a 369.7 
million increase in auto loans 
and leases, and an increase 
 of 184.3 
million in 
commercial and 
construction loans 
(net of 
a 138.2 
million decrease 
in the 
carrying value 
of the 
SBA PPP 
loan 
 portfolio), partially offset 
by a reduction of 
 154.5 million in residential 
mortgage loans. Excluding the 
 138.2 million decrease 
in the 
 carrying 
value 
of 
SBA PPP 
loans, 
commercial 
and 
construction 
loans 
increased 
by 322.5 
million 
mainly 
reflecting 
the origination 
 and purchases of loans 
related to multiple commercial 
relationships, each in excess 
of 10 million, that 
increased the portfolio 
amount 
 by 637.1 
million, partially 
offset 
by payoffs 
and paydowns 
of large 
commercial 
relationships totaling 
 219.9 million, 
the sale 
of a 
 35.2 
million 
commercial 
and 
industrial 
loan 
participation 
in 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
region, 
and 
the 
sale 
of 
a 
 23.9 
million 
adversely 
 classified commercial and 
industrial loan participation in the Florida region.
 As of December 31, 
2022, 
the loans held for 
the Corporation s 
investment portfolio was comprised 
of commercial and construction 
 loans 
(46 ), 
residential 
real

 Residential Real Estate Loans 
 As of 
December 31, 
2022, the 
Corporation s 
total residential 
mortgage 
loan portfolio, 
including 
loans held 
for sale, 
decreased by 
 154.5 
million, 
as compared 
to 
the 
balance 
as of 
December 31, 
2021. 
The 
residential 
mortgage 
loan 
portfolio 
decreased 
by 
 144.0 
 million in 
the Puerto 
Rico region, 
 8.6 million 
in the 
Virgin 
Islands region, 
and 1.9 
million in 
the Florida 
region. The 
decline in 
all 
 regions was driven 
by repayments, foreclosures, 
and charge-offs, 
which more than 
offset the volume 
of new loan 
originations kept on 
 the balance sheet. 

The 
majority 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
outstanding 
balance 
of 
residential 
mortgage 
loans 
in 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
and 
the 
Virgin 
Islands 
 regions consisted 
of fixed-rate loans 
that traditionally 
carry higher 
yields than 
residential mortgage 
loans in 
the Florida 
region. In 
the 
 Florida 
region, 
approximately 
45 
of 
the 
residential 
mortgage 
loan 
portfolio 
consisted 
of 
hybrid 
adjustable-rate 
mortgages. 
In 
 accordance with 
the Corporation s 
underwriting guidelines, 
residential mortgage 
loans are 
primarily fully 
documented loans, 
and the 
 Corporation does not originate negative amortization loans. 
 Residential 
mortgage 
loan 
originations 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022 
amounted 
to 
 468.6 
million, 
compared 
to 
 623.3 
 million for 2021. 
The decrease in residential 
mortgage loan originations 
of 154.7 million 
consisted of declines 
of 136.8 million 
and 
 21.8 million 
in the Puerto 
Rico and Florida 
regions, respectively, 
partially offset 
by an increase 
of 3.9 million 
in the Virgin 
Islands 
 region. The 
decrease in 
2022 reflects 
lower levels 
of refinancings 
driven by 
the effect 
of higher 
market interest 
rates. Approximately 
 54 of the 
 363.0 million residential 
mortgage loan originations 
in the Puerto 
Rico region during 
the year ended 
December 31, 2022 
 were of conforming loans, compared to 88 of 499.7 million for the year ended 
December 31, 2021. 

70 
 Commercial and Construction Loans 
 As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation s 
commercial 
and 
construction 
loan 
portfolio 
increased 
by 
 184.3 
million 
(net 
of 
a 
 138.2 million decrease in the SBA PPP loan portfolio), as compared to the balance 
as of December 31, 2021. 

 In the 
Puerto 
Rico region, 
commercial 
and 
construction 
loans increased 
by 49.6 
million (net 
of a 
 98.0 
million decrease 
in the 
 SBA PPP loan portfolio), 
as compared to the 
balance as of December 
31, 2021. Excluding the 
 98.0 million decrease 
in the SBA PPP 
 loan portfolio, commercial and 
construction loans in the 
Puerto Rico region increased by 147.6 
million, driven by the origination 
and 
 purchases 
of loans 
related to 
eleven 
commercial relationships, 
each in 
excess of 
 10 million, 
that increased 
the portfolio 
amount by 
 315.3 
million, 
partially 
offset 
by 
payoffs 
and 
paydowns, 
including 
the 
payoff 
of 
three 
commercial 
and 
construction 
loans 
totaling 
 58.7 million each in excess of 10 million, and the sale of a 35.2 million commercial 
and industrial loan participation. 
 In the 
Florida region, 
commercial and 
construction loans 
increased by 
 147.2 million 
(net of 
a 32.2 million 
decrease in 
the SBA 
 PPP loan portfolio), 
as compared to 
the balance as 
of December 31, 
2021. Excluding the 
 32.2 million decrease 
in the SBA PPP 
loan 
 portfolio, 
commercial 
and 
construction 
loans 
in 
the 
Florida 
region 
increased 
by 
 179.4 
million, 
driven 
by 
the 
origination 
and 
 purchases of 
loans related 
to multiple commercial 
relationships, each 
in excess of 
 10 million, 
that increased 
the portfolio amount 
by 
 321.8 million, partially 
offset by the payoffs 
and paydowns of eight 
commercial relationships totaling 
 161.2 million, and 
the sale of 
 a 23.9 million adversely classified commercial and industrial loan 
participation in the Florida region. 
 In the Virgin 
Islands region, 
commercial and construction 
loans decreased 
by 12.5 million, 
driven by an 
 8.0 million decrease 
in 
 the SBA PPP loan portfolio, as compared to the balance as of December 31, 2021. 
 As of 
December 31, 
2022, 
the Corporation 
had 169.8 
million outstanding 
in loans 
extended 
to the 
Puerto Rico 
government, 
its 
 municipalities, 
and 
public 
corporations, 
compared 
to 
 178.4 
million 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2021. 
See 
 Exposure 
to 
Puerto 
Rico 
 Government below for additional information. 

The 
Corporation 
also 
has 
credit 
exposure 
to 
USVI 
government 
entities. 
As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
had 
 38.0 
 million 
in 
loans 
to 
USVI 
government 
public 
corporations, 
compared 
to 
 39.2 
million 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2021. 
See 
 Exposure 
to

 As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation s 
total 
exposure 
to 
shared 
national 
credit SNC 
loans 
(including 
unused 
 commitments) 
amounted 
to 
 1.1 
billion, 
compared 
to 
 918.6 
million 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2021. 
As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
 approximately 
 189.3 
million 
of 
the 
SNC 
exposure 
is 
related 
to 
the 
portfolio 
in 
Puerto 
Rico 
and 
 872.0 
million 
is 
related 
to 
the 
 portfolio in the Florida region. 
 Commercial and construction loan originations (excluding government 
loans) decreased by 22.3 million to 3.0 billion for the year 
 ended December 
31, 2022, 
when compared 
to the 
same period 
of 2021. 
Total 
commercial and 
construction loan 
originations in 
2021 
 includes 
SBA 
PPP 
loan 
originations 
of 
 283.7 
million. 
Excluding 
SBA 
PPP 
loan 
originations, 
commercial 
and 
construction 
loan 
 originations increased 
by 261.4 
million in 
2022, compared 
to 2021. 
The increase 
consisted of 
increases of 201.4 
million and 
 93.0 
 million in the Puerto Rico and Florida regions, respectively, 
partially offset by a decrease of 33.0 million in the Virgin 
Islands region. 
 Government 
loan 
originations 
for 
2022 
amounted 
to 
 51.1 
million, 
compared 
to 
 62.8 
million 
for 
2021. 
Government 
loan 
 originations in both years primarily consisted of the renewal 
of certain facilities in both the Virgin 
Islands and the Puerto Rico regions, 
 and the utilization of an arranged overdraft line of credit of a government entity in the 
Virgin Islands region. 
 Consumer Loans and Finance Leases 
 As of December 
31, 2022, the 
Corporation s 
consumer loan and 
finance lease portfolio 
increased by 439.5 
million to 3.3 
billion, 
 as 
compared 
to 
the 
portfolio 
balance 
of 
 2.9 
billion 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2021. 
The 
increase 
was 
reflected 
in 
all 
classes 
within 
the 
 consumer 
loan 
portfolio 
segment, 
including 
increases 
of 
 226.5 
million 
and 
 143.2 
million 
in 
the 
auto 
loans 
and 
finance 
leases 
 portfolios, respectively 
. 
The growth 
in consumer 
loans is 
mainly reflected 
in the 
Puerto Rico 
region and 
was driven 
by an 
increased 
 level of loan originations during 2022. 
 Originations of 
auto loans 
(including finance 
leases) in 
2022 amounted 
to 1.0 
billion, compared 
to 932.7 
million for 
2021. The 
 increase 
consisted 
of increases 
of 94.6 
million and 
 5.1 million, 
respectively, 
in the 
Puerto Rico 
and Virgin 
Islands regions. 
Other 
 consumer loan 
originations, excluding 
credit cards, 
for 2022 
amounted to 
 304.5 million, 
compared to 
 172.7 million 
in 2021. 
Most 
 of the 
increase in 
other consumer 
loan originations 
in 2022, 
when compared 
to 2021, 
was in 
the Puerto 
Rico region. 
The utilization 
 activity on the outstanding credit card portfolio for 2022 amounted 
to 488.3 million, compared to 422.5 million for 2021.

 Investment Activities 
 As part of 
its liquidity, 
revenue diversification, 
and interest rate 
risk strategies, First 
BanCorp. maintains 
a debt securities 
portfolio 
 classified as available for sale or held to maturity. 

 The 
Corporation s 
total 
available-for-sale 
debt 
securities 
portfolio 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2022 
amounted 
to 
 5.6 
billion, 
an 
 854.2 
 million decrease 
from December 
31, 2021. 
The decrease 
was mainly 
driven by 
a 718.6 
million decrease 
in fair 
value attributable 
to 
 changes 
in market 
interest rates 
and 
the repayments 
of approximately 
 642.9 million 
of U.S. 
agencies 
and 
MBS, partially 
offset 
by 
 purchases 
of U.S. agencies debentures and MBS totaling 512.3 million during 2022. 

 As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
substantially 
all 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
available-for-sale 
debt 
securities 
portfolio 
was 
invested 
in 
U.S. 
 government and 
agencies debentures 
and fixed-rate 
GSEs MBS. 
In addition, 
as of 
December 31, 
2022, the 
Corporation held 
a bond 
 issued 
by 
the 
PRHFA, 
classified 
as available 
for 
sale, 
specifically 
a 
residential 
pass-through 
MBS in 
the 
aggregate 
amount 
of 3.3 
 million 
(fair 
value 
- 
 2.2 
million). 
This 
residential 
pass-through 
MBS 
issued 
by 
the 
PRHFA 
is 
collateralized 
by 
certain 
second 
 mortgages originated 
under a program 
launched by the 
Puerto Rico government 
in 2010 and 
had an unrealized 
loss of 1.1 
million as 
 of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
of which 
 0.4 
million 
is due 
to credit 
deterioration. 
During 2021, 
the 
Corporation 
placed 
this instrument 
in 
 nonaccrual status based on the delinquency status of the underlying 
second mortgage loans collateral. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Corporation s 
held-to-maturity debt securities portfolio, before the ACL, increased to 
 437.5 million, 
 compared 
to 
 178.1 
million 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2021, 
mainly 
driven 
by 
purchases 
of 
GSEs 
MBS 
totaling 
 289.8 
million 
during 
 2022. Held-to-maturity debt securities consisted of fixed-rate GSEs MBS and financing 
arrangements with Puerto Rico municipalities 
 issued 
in 
bond 
form, 
which 
the 
Corporation 
accounts 
for 
as 
securities, 
but 
which 
were 
underwritten 
as 
loans 
with 
features 
that 
are 
 typically found 
in commercial 
loans. Puerto 
Rico municipal 
bonds typically 
are not 
issued in 
bearer form, 
are not 
registered with 
the 
 Securities 
and 
Exchange 
Commission, 
and 
are 
not 
rated 
by 
external 
credit 
agencies. 
These 
bonds 
have 
seniority 
to 
the 
payment 
of 
 operating costs and 
expenses of 
the municipality 
and, in most 
cases, are supported 
by assigned 
property tax 
revenues. Approximately 
 74 of the 
Corporation s 
municipality bonds 
consisted of 
obligations issued 
by four of 
the largest 
municipalities in 
Puerto Rico. 
The 
 municipalities 
are 
required 
by 
law 
to 
levy 
special 
property 
taxes 
in 
such 
amounts 
as 
are 
required 
for 
the 
payment 
of 
all 
of 
their 
 respective 
general 
obligation 
bonds 
and 
loans. 
Given 
the 
uncertainties 
as 
to 
the 
effects 
that 
the 
fiscal 
position 
of 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
 central government, and 
the measures taken, 
or to be taken, 
by other government 
entities may have 
on municipalities, the 
Corporation 
 cannot be certain whether 
future charges to the 
ACL on these securities will 
be required. As of December 
31, 2022, the ACL for 
held-
 to-maturity debt securities was 8.3 million, compared to 8.6 million 
as of December 31, 2021.

 Net 
interest 
income 
in 
future 
periods 
could 
be 
affected 
by 
prepayments 
of 
MBS. 
Any 
acceleration 
in 
the 
prepayments 
of 
MBS 
 purchased 
at 
a 
premium
 would 
lower 
yields 
on 
these 
securities, 
since 
the 
amortization 
of 
premiums 
paid 
upon 
acquisition 
would 
 accelerate. Conversely, 
acceleration of the 
prepayments of MBS would 
increase yields on 
securities purchased at 
a discount, since 
the 
 amortization of 
the discount 
would accelerate. 
These risks 
are directly 
linked to 
future period 
market interest 
rate fluctuations. 
Also, 
 net 
interest 
income 
in 
future 
periods 
might 
be 
affected 
by 
the 
Corporation s 
investment 
in 
callable 
securities. 
As 
of 
December 
31, 
 2022, the 
Corporation had 
approximately 2.0 
billion in 
callable debt 
securities (U.S. 
agencies debt 
securities) with 
an average 
yield 
 of 0.83 , of which approximately 58 were 
purchased at a discount and 7 
at a premium.

 RISK MANAGEMENT
 General
 Risks 
are 
inherent 
in 
virtually 
all 
aspects 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
business 
activities 
and 
operations. 
Consequently, 
effective 
risk 
 management 
is 
fundamental 
to 
the 
success 
of 
the 
Corporation. 
The 
primary 
goals 
of 
risk 
management 
are 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
 Corporation s 
risk-taking activities are 
consistent with the 
Corporation s 
objectives and risk 
tolerance, and that 
there is an appropriate 
 balance between risks and rewards in order to maximize stockholder value. 
 The 
Corporation 
has 
in 
place 
a 
risk 
management 
framework 
to 
monitor, 
evaluate 
and 
manage 
the 
principal 
risks 
assumed 
in 
 conducting its activities. First BanCorp. s 
business is subject to eleven 
broad categories of risks: (i) liquidity 
risk; (ii) interest rate risk; 
 (iii) market risk; (iv) 
credit risk; (v) operational 
risk; (vi) legal and 
regulatory risk; (vii) 
reputational risk; (viii) model 
risk; (ix) capital 
 risk; (x) 
strategic risk; 
and (xi) 
information technology 
risk. First 
BanCorp. has 
adopted policies 
and procedures 
designed to 
identify 
 and manage the risks to which the Corporation is exposed. 
 Risk Definition
 Liquidity Risk 
 Liquidity risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from the possibility that the Corporation 
will not have sufficient cash to meet 
 its short-term liquidity demands, such as from deposit redemptions or loan commitments. 
See Liquidity Risk and Capital Adequacy 
 below for further details. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk is the risk arising from adverse movements in interest 
rates. See Interest Rate Risk Management 
below for 
 further details. 
 Market Risk 
 Market 
risk 
is 
the 
risk 
of 
loss 
in 
the 
value 
of 
assets 
or 
liabilities 
due 
to 
changes 
in 
market 
conditions, 
including 
movements 
in 
 market 
rates or 
prices, such 
as interest 
rates 
or equity 
prices. The 
Corporation 
evaluates market 
risk together 
with interest 
rate risk. 

 Both 
changes 
in 
market 
values 
and 
changes 
in 
interest 
rates 
are 
evaluated 
and 
forecasted. 
See 
 Interest 
Rate 
Risk 
Management 
 below for further details. 
 Credit Risk
 Credit risk 
is the 
risk arising 
from a 
borrower s or 
a counterparty s 
failure to 
meet the 
terms of 
a contract 
with the 
Corporation or 
 otherwise to perform as agreed. See Credit Risk Management 
below for further details. 
 Operational Risk 
 
Operational 
risk 
is 
the 
risk 
arising 
from 
problems 
with 
the 
delivery 
of 
services 
or 
products. 
This 
risk 
is 
a 
function 
of 
internal 
 controls, 
information 
systems, 
employees 
and 
operating 
processes. 
It 
also 
includes 
risks 
associated 
with 
the 
Corporation s 
 preparedness 
for 
the 
occurrence 
of 
an 
unforeseen 
event. 
This 
risk 
is 
inherent 
across 
all 
functions, 
products, 
and 
services 
of 
the 
 Corporation. See Operational Risk below for further details. 

75 
 Legal and Regulatory Risk
 Legal and 
regulatory 
risk is 
the risk 
arising 
from 
the Corporation s 
failure 
to comply 
with laws 
or regulations 
that can 
adversely 
 affect the Corporation s 
reputation and/or increase its exposure to litigation or penalties. 

 Reputational Risk
 Reputational 
risk 
is 
the 
risk 
arising 
from 
any 
adverse 
effect 
on 
the 
Corporation s 
market 
value, 
capital, 
or 
earnings 
arising 
from 
 negative public opinion, 
whether true or not. 
This risk affects the 
Corporation s 
ability to establish new 
relationships or services, 
or to 
 continue servicing existing relationships. 
 Model Risk 
 Model risk 
is the potential 
for adverse 
consequences from 
decisions based 
upon incorrect 
or misused 
model outputs 
and reports 
or 
 based upon 
an incomplete or 
inaccurate model. The 
use of models 
exposes the Corporation 
to some level 
of model risk. 
Model errors 
 can 
contribute 
to 
incorrect 
valuations 
and 
lead 
to 
operational 
errors, 
inappropriate 
business 
decisions, 
or 
incorrect 
financial 
entries. 
 The Corporation seeks to reduce model risk through rigorous model identification 
and validation. 
 Capital Risk 
 Capital risk 
is the 
risk that 
the Corporation 
may lose 
value on 
its capital 
or have 
an inadequate 
capital plan, 
which would 
result in 
 insufficient capital 
resources to meet 
minimum regulatory requirements 
(the Corporation s 
authority to operate 
as a bank is dependent 
 upon the maintenance of adequate capital resources), support its credit rating, 
or support its growth and strategic options. 

 Strategic Risk 
 Strategic 
risk 
is 
the 
risk 
arising 
from 
adverse 
business 
decisions, 
poor 
implementation 
of 
business 
decisions, 
or 
lack 
of 
 responsiveness 
to 
changes 
in 
the 
banking 
industry, 
and 
operating 
environment. 
This 
risk 
is 
a 
function 
of 
the 
compatibility 
of 
the 
 Corporation s strategic 
goals, the business strategies 
developed to achieve 
those goals, the resources deployed 
against these goals, and 
 the quality of implementation. 
 Information Technology 
Risk 
 Information technology 
risk is 
the risk 
arising from 
the loss of 
confidentiality, 
integrity, 
or availability 
of information 
systems and 
 risk 
of 
cyber 
incidents 
or 
data 
breaches. 
It 
includes 
business 
risks 
associated 
with 
the 
use, 
ownership, 
operation, 
involvement, 
 influence, and adoption of information technology within the Corporation. 
 Risk Governance 
 The 
following 
discussion 
highlights 
the 
roles 
and 
responsibilities 
of 
the 
key 
participants 
in 
the 
Corporation s 
risk 
management 
 framework: 
 Board of Directors
 The Board 
of Directors 
oversees the 
Corporation s 
overall 
risk governance 
program 
with the 
assistance 
of the 
Board 
committees 
 discussed below. 
 Risk Committee 
 The 
Board 
of 
Directors 
has 
appointed 
the 
Risk 
Committee

assist 
the 
Board 
in 
fulfilling 
its 
responsibility 
to 
oversee 
the 
 Corporation s 
management of

position of 
the Chairman 
of the 
Board, 
 and 
directing 
and 
overseeing 
the 
Corporation s 
executive 
succession 
plan. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Corporate 
Governance 
and 
Nominating 
 Committee is responsible for overseeing the Corporation s 
sustainability and environmental, social, and governance ESG policies. 
 Compensation and Benefits Committee 
 The Board 
of Directors 
has appoint

Board 
of 
the 
proper 
and 
competitive 
salaries 
and 
incentive 
compensation 
 programs of the executive officers and key employees of 
the Corporation. 

 Trust Committee 
 The Board 
of Directors 
of the 
Bank has 
appointed the 
Trust Committee 
to assist 
such Board 
of Directors 
in fulfilling 
its oversight 
 responsibilities with respect to the Trust 
Department and its fiduciary responsibilities. The 
Trust Committee s 
main responsibilities are 
 to 
ensure 
proper 
exercise 
of 
the 
fiduciary 
powers 
of 
the 
Bank 
and 
to 
review 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
Trust 
Department. 
The 
Trust 
 Committee has jurisdiction over all aspects of the Trust 
Department and may act on behalf of the Board of Directors of the Bank. 
 Management Roles and Responsibilities 
 While 
the 
Board 
of 
Directors 
has 
the 
responsibility 
to 
oversee 
the 
risk 
governance 
program, 
management 
is 
responsible 
for 
 implementing 
the necessary 
policies and 
procedures, 
and internal 
controls. To 
carry out 
these responsibilities, 
the Corporation 
has a 
 clearly 
defined 
risk governance 
culture. To 
ensure that 
risk management 
is communicated 
at all 
levels of 
the Corporation, 
and each 
 area understands 
its specific 
role, the 
Corporation has 
established several 
management level 
committees to 
support risk 
oversight, 
as 
 follows: 

 Executive Risk Management Committee
 The 
Executive 
Risk 
Management 
Committee 
is 
responsible 
for 
exercising 
oversight 
of 
information 
regarding 
First 
BanCorp. s 
 enterprise 
risk 
management 
framework, 
including 
the 
significant 
policies, 
procedures, 
and 
practices 
employed 
to 
manage 
the 
 identified 
risk 
categories 
(credit 
risk, 
operational 
risk, 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
risk, 
reputational 
risk, 
model 
risk, 
and 
capital 
risk). 
In 
 carrying 
out 
its 
oversight 
responsibilities, 
each 
committee 
member 
is 
entitled 
to 
rely 
on 
the 
integrity 
and 
expertise 
of 
those 
people 
 providing 
information 
to 
the committee 
and 
on 
the 
accuracy 
and 
completeness 
of 
such 
information, 
absent 
actual 
knowledge 
of 
an 
 inaccuracy. 
 The 
Chief 
Executive 
Officer 
appoints 
the 
Executive 
Risk Management 
Committee 
and members 
of 
the Corporation s 
senior 
and 
 executive management have 
the opportunity to 
share their insights about 
the types of risks 
that could impede 
the Corporation s 
ability 
 to achieve 
its business 
objectives. The 
Chief Risk 
Officer 
of the 
Corporation directs 
the agenda 
for 
the meetings 
and the 
Enterprise 
 Risk Management ERM and 
Operational Risk 
Director serves 
as secretary 
of the 
committee and 
maintains the 
minutes on 
behalf 
 of the committee. The General Auditor also participates in the committee as an observer. 

78 
 The 
committee 
provides 
assistance 
and 
support 
to 
the 
Chief 
Risk 
Officer 
to 
promote 
effective 
risk 
management 
throughout 
the 
 Corporation. 
The 
Chief 
Risk 
Officer 
and 
the 
ERM 
and 
Operational 
Risk 
Director 
report 
to 
the 
Committee 
matters 
related 
to 
the 
 enterprise risk management framework of the Corporation, including, but not 
limited to: 
 
 The risk governance structure; 
 
 The risk competencies of the Corporation; 
 
 The Corporation s risk appetite statement 
and risk tolerance; and 
 
 The risk management 
strategy and associated risk 
management initiatives and 
how both support the

 Liquidity Risk and Capital Adequacy, 
Interest Rate Risk Management, Credit Risk 
Management, Operational Risk, Legal 
 and Compliance Risk and Concentration Risk 
 The 
following 
discussion 
highlights 
First 
BanCorp. s 
adopted 
policies 
and 
procedures 
for 
liquidity 
risk 
and 
capital 
adequacy, 
 interest rate risk, credit risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and 
concentration risk. 
 Liquidity Risk and Capital Adequacy 
 Liquidity 
risk 
involves 
the 
ongoing 
ability 
to 
accommodate 
liability 
maturities 
and 
deposit 
withdrawals, 
fund 
asset growth 
and 
 business operations, 
and meet 
contractual obligations 
through unconstrained 
access to funding 
at reasonable 
market rates. Liquidity 
 management 
involves 
forecasting 
funding 
requirements 
and 
maintaining 
sufficient 
capacity 
to 
meet 
liquidity 
needs 
and 
 accommodate 
fluctuations 
in 
asset 
and 
liability 
levels 
due 
to 
changes 
in 
the 
Corporation s 
business 
operations 
or 
unanticipated 
 events. 

The Corporation 
manages liquidity 
at two 
levels. The 
first is 
the liquidity 
of the 
parent company, 
which is 
the holding 
company 
 that owns the banking and non-banking subsidiaries. The second 
is the liquidity of the banking subsidiary. 

 The Asset 
and Liability 
Committee of 
the Board 
is responsible 
for overseeing 
management s 
establishment of 
the Corporation s 
 liquidity 
policy, 
as 
well 
as 
approving 
operating 
and 
contingency 
procedures 
and 
monitoring 
liquidity 
on 
an 
ongoing 
basis. 
The 
 MIALCO, 
which 
reports 
to 
the 
Board 
of 
Directors 
Asset 
and 
Liability 
Committee, 
uses 
measures 
of 
liquidity 
developed 
by 
 management 
that 
involve 
the 
use 
of 
several 
assumptions 
to 
review 
the 
Corporation s 
liquidity 
position 
on 
a 
monthly 
basis. 
The 
 MIALCO oversees liquidity management, interest rate risk, market 
risk, and other related matters. 

The MIALCO is composed of 
senior management officers, including 
the Chief Executive Officer, 
the Chief Financial Officer, 
the 
 Chief Risk 
Officer, 
the Corporate 
Strategic and 
Business Development 
Director, 
the Treasury 
and 
Investments 
Risk Manager, 
the 
 Financial 
Planning 
and 
ALM Director 
, 
and 
the Treasurer. 
The 
Treasury 
and 
Investments Division 
is responsible 
for planning 
and 
 executing the Corporation s 
funding activities and strategy, 
monitoring liquidity availability on 
a daily basis, and reviewing liquidity 
 measures 
on 
a 
weekly 
basis. 
The 
Treasury 
and 
Investments 
Accounting 
and 
Operations 
area 
of 
the 
Corporate 
Controller s 
 Department 
is responsible 
for calculating 
the 
liquidity measurements 
used by 
the Treasury 
and Investment 
Division 
to review 
the 
 Corporation s 
liquidity 
position 
on 
a 
monthly 
basis. 
The 
Financial 
Planning 
and 
ALM 
Division 
is 
responsible 
to 
estimate 
the 
 liquidity gap for longer periods. 
 To 
ensure 
adequate liquidity 
through the 
full range 
of potential 
operating 
environments and 
market conditions, 
the Corporation 
 conducts 
its 
liquidity 
management 
and 
business 
activities 
in 
a 
manner 
that 
is 
intended 
to 
preserve 
and 
enhance 
funding 
stability, 
 flexibility, 
and 
diversity. 
Key 
components 
of 
this 
operating 
strategy 
include 
a 
strong 
focus 
on 
the 
continued 
development 
of 
 customer-based 
funding, the 
maintenance 
of direct 
relationships with 
wholesale 
market funding 
providers, and 
the maintenance 
of 
 the ability to liquidate certain assets when, and if, requirements warrant. 

The 
Corporation 
develops 
and 
maintains 
contingency 
funding 
plans. 
These 
plans 
evaluate 
the 
Corporation s 
liquidity 
position 
 under various 
operating circumstances 
and are 
designed to 
help ensure 
that the 
Corporation will 
be able 
to operate 
through periods 
 of stress when 
access to normal 
sources of funds 
is constrained. The 
plans project funding 
requirements during 
a potential period 
of 
 stress, specify and quantify sources of liquidity, 
outline actions and procedures for effectively managing liquidity 
through a period of 
 stress, and 
define roles 
and responsibilities 
for the 
Corporation s 
employees. Under 
the contingency 
funding plans, 
the Corporation 
 stresses the 
balance sheet 
and the liquidity 
position to 
critical levels 
that mimic 
difficulties in 
generating funds 
or even 
maintaining 
 the current 
funding position 
of the 
Corporation and 
the Bank 
and are 
designed to 
help ensure 
the ability 
of the 
Corporation and 
the 
 Bank to honor 
their respective commitments. 
The Corporation has 
established liquidity 
triggers that the 
MIALCO monitors in 
order 
 to 
maintain 
the 
ordinary 
funding 
of 
the 
banking 
business. 
The 
MIALCO 
developed 
contingency 
funding 
plans 
for 
the 
following 
 three scenarios: 
a credit 
rating downgrade, 
an economic 
cycle downturn 
event, and 
a concentration 
event. The 
Board of 
Directors 
 Asset and Liability Committee reviews and approves these plans on an annual basis. 
 The 
Corporation 
manages 
its 
liquidity 
in 
a 
proactive 
manner 
and 
in 
an 
effort 
to 
maintain 
a 
sound 
liquidity 
position. 
It 
uses 
 multiple measures to 
monitor the liquidity 
position, including core 
liquidity, 
basic liquidity, 
and time-based reserve 
measures. As of 
 December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
estimated 
core 
liquidity 
reserve 
(which 
includes 
cash 
and 
free 
high 
quality 
liquid 
assets 
such 
as 
U.S. 
 government 
and GSEs 
obligations that 
could be 
liquidated within 
one day) 
was 3.5 
billion, or 
19.0 of 
total assets, 
compared to 
 5.6 billion, or 27.0 
of total assets as of 
December 31, 2021. The 
basic liquidity ratio (which 
adds available secured lines 
of credit 
 to 
the 
core 
liquidity) 
was 
approximately 
22.5 
of 
total 
assets 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
compared 
to 
32.7 
of 
total assets 
as 
of 
 December 
31, 2021. 
The decrease 
in the 
core 
liquidity 
reserves is 
in part 
due 
to customer 
deposits withdrawals 
and 
maturities, as 
 well as the funding of loan growth. 
 As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
had 
 644.2 
million 
available 
for 
credit 
from 
the 
FHLB. 
The 
Corporation 
also 
 maintains borrowing 
capacity at 
the FED 
Discount Window. 
The Corporation 
does not 
consider borrowing 
capacity from 
the FED 

82 
 Discount 
Window 
as a 
primary 
source 
of liquidity 
but had 
approximately 
 1.3 billion 
available 
for 
funding under 
the FED s 
BIC 
 Program as 
of December 
31, 2022 
as an 
additional contingent 
source. Total 
loans pledged 
to the 
FED Discount 
Window 
amounted 
 to 2.2 billion as of 
December 31, 2022. The Corporation 
also does not rely on uncommitted 
inter-bank lines of credit 
(federal funds 
 lines) to fund its operations and does not include them in the basic liquidity measure. 
 As of December 
31, 2022, the holding 
company had 19.3 million 
of cash and cash 
equivalents. Cash and 
cash equivalents at 
the 
 Bank level 
as of 
December 
31, 2022 
were approximately 
 479.8 
million, 
primarily 
balances deposited 
at the 
FED. The 
Bank had 
 105.8 
million 
in 
brokered 
CDs 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
of 
which 
approximately 
 55.7 
million 
mature 
over 
the 
next 
twelve 
 months. 
Liquidity 
at 
the 
Bank 
level 
is 
highly 
dependent 
on 
bank 
deposits, 
which 
fund 
86.9 
of 
the 
Bank s 
assets 
(or 
86.3 
 excluding brokered 
CDs). Historically, 
the use 
of brokered 
CDs has 
been an 
additional source 
of funding 
for the 
Corporation as 
it 
 provides an 
additional efficient 
channel for 
funding diversification 
and can 
be obtained 
faster than 
regular retail 
deposits. Brokered 
 CDs have been maintained at low levels due to the excess liquidity and availability 
of core deposits. 

 Over the 
last twelve 
months, the 
FED s 
policy to 
control the 
inflationary economic 
environment, 
including the 
rising of 
market 
 interest 
rates, 
have 
resulted 
in 
excess 
liquidity 
gradually 
tapering 
off 
and 
impacting 
the 
Corporation s 
core 
deposit 
balances 
as 
 customers have 
allocated cash 
into higher 
yielding options. 
During the 
fourth quarter 
of 2022, 
the Corporation 
increased the 
use of 
 short-term advances 
from the 
FHLB, repurchase 
agreements, and 
other sources, 
such as 
wholesale funding 
brokers. The 
additional 
 use 
and 
future 
levels 
of 
these 
sources 
of 
funding 
are 
dependent 
on 
factors 
such 
as 
the 
loan 
portfolio 
future 
pipeline, 
customers 
 continuing 
to 
allocate 
more 
cash 
into 
higher 
yielding 
alternatives, 
among 
other 
factors. 
Funding 
through 
these 
sources 
could 
 potentially increase the overall cost of funding for the Corporation and impact 
the net interest margin. 
 Furthermore, as 
a provider of 
financial services, 
the Corporation routinely 
enters into commitments 
with off-balance 
sheet risk to 
 meet the 
financial needs 
of its 
customers. These 
financial instruments 
may include 
loan commitments 
and standby 
letters of 
credit. 
 These 
commitments 
are 
subject 
to 
the 
same 
credit 
policies 
and 
approval 
processes 
used 
for 
on-balance 
sheet 
instruments. 
These 
 instruments involve, to varying degrees, 
elements of credit and interest rate risk 
in excess of the amount recognized in the 
statements 
 of financial 
condition. As 
of December 
31, 2022, 
the Corporation s 
commitments to 
extend credit 
amounted to 
approximately 1.9 
 billion. 
Commitments 
to 
extend 
credit 
are 
agreements 
to 
lend 
to 
a 
customer 
as 
long 
as 
there 
is 
no 
violation 
of 
any 
condition 
 established 
in 
the 
contract. 
Since 
certain 
commitments 
are 
expected 
to 
expire 
without 
being 
drawn 
upon, 
the 
total 
commitment 
 amount does 
not necessarily 
represent future 
cash requirements. For 
most of the 
commercial lines of 
credit, the 
Corporation has 
the 
 option 
to 
reevaluate 
the 
agreement 
prior 
to 
additional 
disbursements. 
There 
have 
been 
no 
significant 
or 
unexpected 
draws 
on 
 existing commitments. In the case of 
credit cards and personal lines 
of credit, the Corporation can 
cancel the unused credit facility 
at 
 any time and without cause.

The 
Corporation 
engages 
in 
the ordinary 
course 
of business 
in 
other 
financial 
transactions 
that 
are not 
recorded 
on the 
balance 
 sheet, 
or 
may 
be 
recorded 
on 
the 
balance 
sheet 
in 
amounts 
that 
are 
different 
from 
the 
full 
contract 
or 
notional 
amount 
of 
the 
 transaction and, thus, affecting 
the Corporation s 
liquidity position. These transactions are 
designed to (i) meet the financial 
needs of 
 customers, (ii) manage the 
Corporation s credit, 
market and liquidity risks, (iii) 
diversify the Corporation s 
funding sources, and (iv) 
 optimize capital. 

 In addition to the 
aforementioned off-balance 
sheet debt obligations 
and unfunded commitments 
to extend credit, the 
Corporation 
 has obligations and commitments to make future payments 
under contracts, amounting to approximately 3.4 
billion as of December 
 31, 
2022. 
Our 
material 
cash 
requirements 
comprise 
primarily 
of 
contractual 
obligations 
to 
make 
future 
payments 
related 
to 
time 
 deposits, 
short-term 
borrowings, 
long-term 
debt, 
and 
operating 
lease 
obligations. 
We 
also 
have 
other 
contractual 
cash 
obligations 
 related 
to 
certain 
binding 
agreements 
we 
have 
entered 
into 
for 
services 
including 
outsourcing 
of 
technology 
services, 
security, 
 advertising and 
other services 
which are 
not material 
to our 
liquidity needs. 
We 
currently anticipate 
that our 
available funds, 
credit 
 facilities, and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to 
meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future. 
 Off-balance sheet 
transactions are continuously 
monitored to consider 
their potential impact 
to our liquidity 
position and changes 
 are applied to the balance between sources and uses of funds, as deemed appropriate, 
to maintain a sound liquidity position. 
 Sources of Funding 
 The 
Corporation 
utilizes 
different 
sources 
of 
funding 
to 
help 
ensure 
that 
adequate 
levels 
of 
liquidity 
are 
available 
when 
needed. 
 Diversification of 
funding sources is 
of great importance 
to protect the 
Corporation s 
liquidity from market 
disruptions. The 
principal 
 sources of 
short-term 
funds are 
deposits, including 
brokered CDs. 
Additional funding 
is provided 
by short- 
and long-term 
securities 
 sold under agreements 
to repurchase and 
lines of credit with 
the FHLB. Consistent with 
its strategy, 
the Corporation has been 
seeking 
 to add core deposits. 

 The Asset and Liability Committee 
reviews credit availability on 
a regular basis. The Corporation has 
also sold mortgage loans as 
a 
 supplementary 
source 
of 
funding 
and 
participates 
in 
the 
BIC 
Program 
of 
the 
FED. 
The 
Corporation 
has 
also 
obtained 
long-term 
 funding in the past through the issuance of notes and long-term brokered CDs. 

 The 
Corporation 
continues 
to 
have 
access 
to 
financing 
through 
counterparties 
to 
repurchase 
agreements, 
the 
FHLB, 
and 
other 
 agents, such 
as wholesale fundi 
ng brokers. 
While liquidity is 
an ongoing 
challenge for all 
financial institutions, 
management believes 
 that 
the 
Corporation s 
available 
borrowing 
capacity 
and 
efforts 
to 
grow 
retail 
deposits 
will 
be 
adequate 
to 
provide 
the 
necessary 
 funding for the Corporation s business 
plans in the foreseeable future.

 The Corporation s principal sources 
of funding are discussed below:

 The weighted-average interest rate on total interest-bearing deposits 
as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 1.03 and 0.31 , 
respectively. 

 Retail 
deposits 
 
The 
Corporation s 
deposit 
products 
include 
regular 
savings 
accounts, 
demand 
deposit 
accounts, 
money 
market 
 accounts, 
and 
retail 
CDs. As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation s 
deposits, 
excluding 
government 
deposits 
and 
brokered 
CDs, 
 decreased by 1.1 billion 
to 13.3 billion from 
 14.4 billion as of December 
31, 2021. The 1.1 
billion decrease was primarily 
related 
 to 
lower 
balances 
in 
commercial 
savings 
accounts, 
retail 
CDs, 
and 
retail 
demand 
deposits 
accounts 
primarily 
in 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
 region, reflecting, 
among other 
things, the 
effect of 
customers allocation 
of cash 
balances into 
higher-yielding 
options and 
elevated 
 customer spending. 
 Government deposits
 
 As of 
December 31, 
2022, the Corporation 
had 2.3 billion 
of Puerto Rico 
public sector deposits 2.2 billion 
 in transactional 
accounts and 
 162.6 million 
in time 
deposits), compared 
to 2.7 
billion as 
of December 
31, 2021, 
which are 
insured 
 by 
the 
FDIC 
up 
to 
the 
applicable 
limits 
and 
the 
uninsured 
portion 
is 
fully 
collateralized. 
Approximately 
24 
of 
the 
public 
sector 
 deposits 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2022 
were 
from 
municipalities 
and 
municipal 
agencies 
in 
Puerto 
Rico 
and 
76 
were 
from 
public 
 corporations, the 
central government 
and agencies, and 
U.S. federal 
government agencies 
in Puerto Rico. 
The decrease was 
primarily 
 related to decreases in transactional 
account balances of government 
public corporations that reflect, 
among other things, utilization of 
 federal funding allocated to Puerto Rico. 
 In 
addition, 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
had 
 442.8 
million 
of 
government 
deposits 
in 
the 
Virgin 
Islands 
region 
 (December 31, 2021 - 568.4 million) and 11.6 
million in the Florida region (December 31, 2021 - 9.6 million). 
 Estimate of Uninsured 
Deposits 
 As of December 31, 
2022 and 2021, the estimated 
amount of uninsured deposits 
totaled 7.6 billion 
 and 8.9 
billion, respectively, 
generally representing 
the portion 
of deposits 
in domestic 
offices that 
exceed the 
FDIC insurance 
limit 
 of 250,000 
and amounts 
in any other 
uninsured deposit 
account. The 
balances presented 
as of December 
31, 2022 
and 2021 
include 
 the 
uninsured 
portion 
of 
government 
deposits, 
which 
are 
fully 
collateralized 
as 
previously 
mentioned. 
The 
amount 
of 
uninsured 
 deposits is calculated based 
on the same methodologies 
and assumptions used for 
our bank regulatory reporting 
requirements adjusted 
 for cash held by wholly-owned subsidiaries at the Bank.

The following table presents by contractual maturities the amount of U.S. time

 Total 
brokered CDs 
increased during 
2022 by 5.4 
million to 105.8 
million as of 
December 31, 
2022, compared 
to 
 100.4 million as of December 31, 2021. 

 The average remaining term to maturity of the brokered CDs outstanding 
as of December 31, 2022 was approximately 1.6 years. 

 The use of 
brokered CDs provides 
an efficient channel 
for funding diversification 
and interest rate management. 
Brokered CDs are 
 insured by the FDIC up to regulatory limits and can be obtained faster than regular 
retail deposits.

 Borrowings 
 
As of December 31, 2022, total borrowings amounted to 933.9 million, compared

 The 
Corporation s 
investment 
portfolio 
is 
funded 
in 
part 
with 
repurchase 
 agreements. 
The Corporation s 
outstanding 
short-term 
securities sold 
under repurchase 
agreements 
amounted 
to 75.1 
million 
as of 
 December 
31, 
2022 
and 
are 
scheduled 
to 
mature 
during 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
2023. 
The 
 300.0 
million 
of 
long-term 
repurchase 
 agreements 
that were 
outstanding 
as of 
December 31, 
2021 matured 
or were 
called close 
to its 
maturity during 
2022. In 
addition to 
 these repurchase agreements, 
the Corporation has been 
able to maintain 
access to credit by 
using cost-effective 
sources such as FHLB 
 advances. See 
Note 12 
 Securities 
Sold Under 
Agreements to 
Repurchase, to 
the audited 
consolidated financial 
statements included 
 in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, for further details about repurchase agreements outstanding 
by counterparty and maturities. 

Under the Corporation s 
repurchase agreements, as 
is the case with 
derivative contracts, the 
Corporation is required 
to pledge cash 
 or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements. 
To the extent that the value 
of securities previously pledged as collateral declines 
 due to changes in interest 
rates, a liquidity crisis or 
any other factor, the 
Corporation is required to deposit 
additional cash or securities 
 to meet 
its margin 
requirements, thereby 
adversely affecting 
its liquidity. 
Given the 
quality of 
the collateral 
pledged, the 
Corporation 
 has not experienced margin calls from counterparties 
arising from credit-quality-related write-downs in valuations. 
 Advances from 
the FHLB 
 The Bank is 
a member of 
the FHLB system 
and obtains advances 
to fund its 
operations under a 
collateral 
 agreement with the FHLB that requires the Bank to maintain qualifying 
mortgages and/or investments as collateral for advances taken. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding balance 
of fixed-rate FHLB advances was 675.0 million, compared 
to 200.0 million as of 
 December 31, 
2021. The 200.0 
million in long-term 
FHLB advances outstanding 
as of December 
31, 2021 matured 
and were repaid 
 during 
the third 
quarter of 
2022. 
In addition, 
during 
the fourth 
quarter of 
2022, 
the Corporation 
added 475.0 
million of 
short-term 
 FHLB advances that are scheduled 
to mature during the 
first quarter of 2023 and 
 200.0 million of long-term 
FHLB advances that are 
 scheduled 
to 
mature 
in 
November 
2027. 
Of 
the 
 675.0 
million 
in 
FHLB 
advances, 
 225.0 
million 
were 
pledged 
with 
investment 

86 
 securities 
and 
 450.0 
million 
were 
pledged 
with 
mortgage 
loans. 
As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
had 
 644.2 
million 
 available for additional credit on FHLB lines of credit based on collateral 
pledged at the FHLB of New York 
. 
 Trust Preferred 
Securities 
 In 2004, FBP 
Statutory Trusts 
I and II, 
statutory trusts that 
are wholly-owned by 
the Corporation and 
not 
 consolidated 
in 
the 
Corporation s 
financial 
statements, 
sold 
to 
institutional 
investors 
variable-rate 
TRuPs 
and 
used 
the 
proceeds 
of 
 these issuances, together 
with the proceeds 
of the purchases by 
the Corporation of 
variable rate common 
securities, to purchase 
junior 
 subordinated 
deferrable 
debentures. 
The 
subordinated 
debentures 
are 
presented 
in 
the 
Corporation s 
consolidated 
statements 
of 
 financial 
condition 
as 
other 
borrowings. 
As 
of 
each 
of 
December 
31, 
2022 
and 
2021, 
the 
Corporation 
had 
subordinated 
debentures 
 outstanding in the aggregate amount 
of 183.8 million with maturity dates from 
June 17, 2034 through September 20, 2034. 
Under the 
 indentures, the 
Corporation has the 
right, from 
time to time, 
and without 
causing an event 
of default, 
to defer payments 
of interest 
on 
 the Junior Subordinated 
Deferrable Debentures by 
extending the interest 
payment period at 
any time and 
from time to time 
during the 
 term of 
the subordinated 
debentures 
for up 
to twenty 
consecutive 
quarterly periods. 
As of 
December 31, 
2022, 
the Corporation 
was 
 current 
on 
all 
interest 
payments 
due 
on 
its 
subordinated 
debt.

 Other Sources 
of Funds 
and Liquidity
 
- The 
Corporation s 
principal uses 
of funds 
are for 
the origination 
of loans, 
the repayment 
of 
 maturing deposits 
and borrowings, 
and deposits 
withdrawals. In 
connection with 
its mortgage 
banking activities, 
the Corporation 
has 
 invested in technology and personnel to enhance the Corporation s 
secondary mortgage market capabilities.

The enhanced 
capabilities improve 
the Corporation s 
liquidity profile 
as they 
allow the 
Corporation to 
derive liquidity, 
if needed, 
 from the sale 
of mortgage loans 
in the secondary 
market. The U.S. 
(including Puerto Rico) 
secondary mortgage market 
is still highly-
 liquid, in 
large part 
because of 
the sale 
of mortgages 
through guarantee 
programs of 
the FHA, 
VA, 
U.S. Department 
of Housing 
and 
 Urban Development HUD ), FNMA 
and FHLMC. During 2022, 
loans pooled into GNMA MBS amounted 
to approximately 144.5 
 million. Also, during 
2022, the Corporation 
sold approximately 93.8 
million of performing 
residential mortgage 
loans to FNMA and 
 FHLMC. 
 The 
FED 
Discount 
Window 
is 
a 
cost-efficient 
contingent 
source 
of 
funding 
for 
the 
Corporation 
in 
highly-volatile 
market 
 conditions. As previously mentioned, 
although currently not in use, 
as of December 31, 2022, 
the Corporation had approximately 1.3 
 billion available for funding under the FED s 
Discount Window based on collateral pledged at the 
FED. 
 Effect of Credit Ratings on Access to Liquidity 
 The 
Corporation s 
liquidity 
is 
contingent 
upon 
its 
ability 
to 
obtain 
external 
sources 
of 
funding 
to 
finance 
its 
operations. 
The 
 Corporation s 
current credit 
ratings and any 
downgrade in credit 
ratings can hinder 
the Corporation s 
access to new 
forms of external 
 funding 
and/or 
cause 
external 
funding 
to 
be 
more 
expensive, 
which 
could, 
in 
turn, 
adversely 
affect 
its 
results 
of 
operations. 
Also, 
 changes in 
credit ratings 
may further 
affect the 
fair value 
of unsecured 
derivatives whose 
value takes 
into account 
the Corporation s 
 own credit risk. 

The Corporation 
does not 
have any 
outstanding debt 
or derivative 
agreements that 
would be 
affected by 
credit rating 
downgrades. 
 Furthermore, given the Corporation s 
non-reliance on corporate debt or 
other instruments directly linked in 
terms of pricing or volume 
 to credit 
ratings, the 
liquidity of 
the Corporation 
has not been 
affected in 
any material 
way by downgrades. 
The Corporation s 
ability 
 to access new non-deposit sources of funding, however, 
could be adversely affected by credit downgrades. 
 As of 
the date 
hereof, the 
Corporation s 
credit as 
a long-term 
issuer is 
rated BB+ 
by S P 
and BB 
by Fitch. 
As of 
the date 
hereof, 
 FirstBank s 
credit 
ratings 
as 
a 
long-term 
issuer 
are 
BB+ 
by 
S P, 
one 
notch 
below 
S P s 
minimum 
BBB- 
level 
required 
to 
be 
 considered investment 
grade; and BB by 
Fitch, two notches 
below Fitch s 
minimum BBB- level 
required to be 
considered investment 
 grade. 
The 
Corporation s 
credit 
ratings 
are 
dependent 
on 
a 
number 
of 
factors,

credit ratings 
is not 
a recommendation

 Cash Flows
 Cash and 
cash equivalents 
were 480.5 
million as 
of December 
31, 2022, 
a decrease 
of 2.1 
billion when 
compared to 
December 
 31, 2021. 
The following 
discussion highlights 
the major 
activities and 
transactions that 
affected 
the Corporation s 
cash flows 
during 
 2022 and 2021: 

 Cash Flows from Operating Activities
 First BanCorp. s 
operating assets and 
liabilities vary significantly 
in the normal course 
of business due to 
the amount and timing 
of 
 cash flows. 
Management believes 
that cash 
flows from 
operations, available 
cash balances, 
and the 
Corporation s 
ability to 
generate 
 cash through 
short and long-term 
borrowings will be 
sufficient to 
fund the Corporation s 
operating liquidity 
needs for the 
foreseeable 
 future. 
 For the years ended December 
31, 2022 and 2021, net 
cash provided by operating activities 
was 440.5 million and 
 399.7 million, 
 respectively. 
Net cash 
generated from 
operating activities 
was higher 
than reported 
net income 
largely as 
a result 
of adjustments 
for 
 non-cash items such 
as depreciation and 
amortization, deferred income 
tax expense and the 
provision for credit 
losses, as well as cash 
 generated from sales of loans held for sale. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 The Corporation s 
investing activities primarily 
relate to originating 
loans to be 
held for investment, 
as well as 
purchasing, selling, 
 and repaying available-for-sale 
and held-to-maturity debt securities. 
For the year ended December 
31, 2022, net cash used in 
investing 
 activities was 
 681.5 million, 
primarily due 
to purchases 
of U.S. 
agencies debentures 
and MBS 
and net 
disbursements on 
loans held 
 for investment, partially offset by repayments of U.S. agencies MBS and 
proceeds from sales of commercial loan participations
 . 

 For the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2021, net 
cash used 
in investing 
activities was 
 1.3 
billion, primarily 
due to 
a higher 
volume of 
 purchases 
of 
U.S. 
agencies 
investment 
securities 
and 
liquidity 
used 
to 
fund 
commercial 
and 
consumer 
loan 
originations, 
partially 
 offset by 
principal collected 
on loans 
and U.S. 
agencies MBS 
repayments, as 
well as 
proceeds from 
U.S. agencies 
bonds called 
prior 
 to maturity, the bulk sale of 
residential mortgage nonaccrual loans, and the sale of criticized commercial 
and construction loans. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities
 The Corporation s 
financing activities 
primarily 
include the 
receipt of 
deposits and 
the issuance 
of brokered 
CDs, the 
issuance of 
 and payments 
on long-term 
debt, the 
issuance of 
equity instruments, 
return of 
capital, and 
activities related 
to its 
short-term funding. 
 For 
the 
year 
ended 
December 31, 
2022, 
net cash 
used by 
financing 
activities 
was 1.8 
billion, 
mainly 
reflecting 
a decrease 
in 
total 
 deposits, the repayment of long-term debt, and capital 
returned to stockholders. These variances were partially offset 
by proceeds from 
 short-term borrowings. 

 For the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2021, net 
cash provided by 
financing activities 
was 1.9 
billion, mainly 
reflecting an 
increase in 
 non-brokered deposits, 
partially offset 
by capital 
returned to 
stockholders, 
and repayment 
of matured 
long-term FHLB 
advances and 
 brokered CDs. 

88 
 Capital 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Corporation s 
stockholders equity was 1.3 billion, 
a decrease of 776.2 million from 
December 31, 
 2021. 
The decrease 
was driven 
by a 
 718.6 million 
decline in 
the fair 
value 
of available-for 
-sale debt 
securities recorded 
as part 
of 
 accumulated other 
comprehensive loss 
in the 
consolidated statements 
of financial 
condition, as 
a result 
of changes 
in market 
interest 
 rates. The 
decrease 
also reflects 
the repurchase 
of 
19.4 
million shares 
of common 
stock for 
a total 
purchase 
price 
of approximately 
 275.0 million, 
and common 
stock dividends 
declared in 
2022 totaling 
 88.2 million 
or 0.46 
per common 
share, partially 
offset by 
 earnings generated during 2022. 

 On February 
9, 2023, 
the Corporation s 
Board of 
Directors declared 
a quarterly 
cash dividend 
of 0.14 
per common 
share, which 
 represents an 
increase of 
 0.02 per 
common share, 
or a 
17 increase, 
compared to 
its most 
recent dividend 
paid in 
December 2022. 
 The dividend 
is payable on 
March 10, 2023 
to shareholders of 
record at the 
close of business 
on February 
24, 2023. 
The Corporation 
 intends 
to 
continue 
to 
pay 
quarterly 
dividends 
on 
common 
stock. 
The 
Corporation s 
common 
stock 
dividends, 
including 
the 
 declaration, 
timing 
and 
amount, 
remain 
subject 
to 
the 
consideration 
and 
approval 
by 
the 
Corporation s 
Board 
of 
Directors 
at 
the 
 relevant times. 
 During the first 
quarter of 2022, 
the Corporation completed 
its prior 300 
million stock repurchase 
program announced in 
2021 by 
 purchasing through open market 
transactions 3.4 million shares 
of its common stock 
for the 50 million remaining 
in the program. On 
 April 
27, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
announced 
that 
its 
Board 
of 
Directors 
approved 
a 
new 
stock 
repurchase 
program, 
under 
which 
the 
 Corporation 
may repurchase 
up to 
 350 million 
of its 
outstanding 
common 
stock, which 
commenced 
in the 
second quarter 
of 2022 
 and 
at the 
time was 
expected to 
be executed 
over four 
quarters. The 
Corporation s 
share repurchase 
program does 
not obligate 
it to 
 acquire any specific number of shares. As of February 
21, 2023, the Corporation has repurchased approximately 
18.1 million shares of 
 common stock 
for a total 
purchase price 
of 254.9 
million under 
the 350 million 
stock repurchase 
program approved 
in April 
2022. 

 The 
Parent 
Company 
has 
no 
operations 
and 
depends 
on 
dividends, 
distributions 
and 
other 
payments 
from 
its 
subsidiaries 
to 
fund 
 dividend payments, stock repurchases, and to fund all payments on its obligations, 
including debt obligations. 
 The tangible common 
equity ratio and 
tangible book value 
per common share 
are non-GAAP financial 
measures generally used 
by 
 the 
financial 
community 
to 
evaluate 
capital 
adequacy. 
Tangible 
common 
equity 
is 
total 
common 
equity 
less 
goodwill, 
and 
other 
 intangible assets. 
Tangible 
assets are 
total assets 
less the 
previously mentioned 
intangible assets.

tangible common equity 
ratio decreased to 6.81 
as of December 31, 2022, 
compared to 9.81 as 
of December 
 31, 2021. The decrease 
in tangible common 
equity includes the effect 
of the 718.6 million 
decrease in the fair 
value of available-for-
 sale debt securities due to changes in market interest rates recognized 
as part of other accumulated other comprehensive loss.

Regulatory 
Matters, 
Commitments 
and 
Contingencies 
for 
the 
regulatory 
capital 
positions 
of 
the 
Corporation 
and 
 FirstBank as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 The Banking Law 
of the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico requires 
that a minimum of 
10 of FirstBank s 
net income for the 
year be 
 transferred 
to a 
legal surplus 
reserve 
until such 
surplus 
equals the 
total of 
paid-in-capital 
on common 
and preferred 
stock. Amounts 
 transferred 
to the 
legal surplus 
reserve 
from 
retained 
earnings are 
not available 
for distribution 
to 
the Corporation 
without 
the prior 
 consent 
of 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
Commissioner 
of 
Financial 
Institutions. 
The 
Puerto 
Rico 
Banking 
Law 
provides 
that, 
when 
the 
 expenditures of a 
Puerto Rico commercial 
bank are greater than 
receipts, the excess of 
the expenditures over 
receipts must be charged 
 against the undistributed 
profits of the 
bank, and 
the balance, if 
any, 
must be charged 
against the legal 
surplus reserve, 
as a reduction 
 thereof. If the legal 
surplus reserve is not sufficient 
to cover such balance 
in whole or in part, 
the outstanding amount must 
be charged 
 against the 
capital account 
and the 
Bank cannot 
pay dividends 
until it 
can replenish 
the legal 
surplus reserve 
to an 
amount of 
at least 
 20 
of 
the 
original 
capital 
contributed. 
During 
the 
years 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022 
and 
2021, 
the 
Corporation 
transferred 
 30.9 
 million 
and 
 28.3 
million, 
respectively, 
to 
the 
legal 
surplus 
reserve. 
FirstBank s 
legal 
surplus 
reserve, 
included 
as 
part 
of 
retained 
 earnings in 
the Corporation s 
consolidated statements 
of financial 
condition, amounted 
to 168.5 
and 137.6 
million as 
of December 
 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Capital risk is 
the risk that 
our capital is 
insufficient to 
support our business 
activities under normal 
and stressed market 
conditions 
 or we 
face capital 
reductions 
or risk-weighted 
assets increases, 
including 
from 
new or 
revised rules 
or changes 
in interpretations 
of 
 existing 
rules, 
and 
are 
therefore 
unable 
to 
meet 
our 
internal 
capital 
targets 
or 
external 
regulatory 
capital 
requirements. 
Capital 
 adequacy 
is of 
critical importance 
to us. 
Accordingly, 
we have 
in place 
a comprehensive 
capital management 
policy that 
provides a 
 framework, defines objectives 
and establishes guidelines 
to maintain an 
appropriate level and 
composition of capital 
in both business-
 as-usual 
and 
stressed 
conditions. 
Our 
capital 
management 
framework 
is 
designed 
to 
provide 
us 
with 
the 
information 
needed 
to 
 comprehensively manage risk and 
develop and apply projected 
stress scenarios that capture 
idiosyncratic vulnerabilities with 
a goal of 
 holding 
sufficient 
capital 
to 
remain 
adequately 
capitalized 
even 
after 
experiencing 
a 
severe 
stress 
event. 
We 
have 
established 
a 
 comprehensive governance 
structure to 
manage and 
oversee our 
capital management 
activities and 
compliance with 
capital rules 
and 
 related 
policies. 
Capital 
planning 
activities 
are 
overseen 
by 
the 
Capital 
Planning 
Committee 
which 
is 
chaired 
by 
the 
CEO 
and 
is 
 comprised 
of 
the 
following 
members: 
the 
CFO, 
CRO, 
and 
the 
Corporate 
Strategy 
and 
Investor 
Relations 
Officer. 
In 
addition, 
 committees 
and 
members 
of 
senior 
management 
are 
responsible 
for 
the 
ongoing 
monitoring 
of 
our 
capital 
adequacy 
and 
evaluate 
 current and 
future regulatory 
capital requirements, 
review the 
results of 
our capital 
planning and 
stress tests 
processes and 
the results 
 of 
our 
capital models, 
and 
review 
our 
contingency 
funding and 
capital 
plan 
and 
key 
capital adequacy 
metrics, 
including 
regulatory 
 capital ratios.

Interest Rate Risk Management 
 First 
BanCorp 
manages 
its 
asset/liability 
position 
to 
limit 
the 
effects 
of 
changes 
in 
interest 
rates 
on 
net 
interest 
income 
and 
to 
 maintain stability 
of profitability 
under varying 
interest rate 
scenarios. The 
MIALCO oversees 
interest rate 
risk and 
monitors, among 
 other things, current 
and expected conditions 
in global financial 
markets, competition 
and prevailing rates 
in the local 
deposit market, 
 liquidity, 
loan 
originations 
pipeline, 
securities 
market 
values, 
recent 
or 
proposed 
changes 
to 
the 
investment 
portfolio, 
alternative 
 funding sources 
and related costs, 
hedging and the 
possible purchase of 
derivatives such as 
swaps and caps, 
and any tax 
or regulatory 
 issues which may be 
pertinent to these areas. 
The MIALCO approves funding 
decisions in light of 
the Corporation s 
overall strategies 
 and objectives. 
 On a quarterly basis, the Corporation performs a consolidated net interest income 
simulation analysis to estimate the potential change 
 in 
future 
earnings 
from 
projected 
changes 
in 
interest 
rates. 
These 
simulations 
are 
carried 
out 
over 
a 
one-to-five-year 
time 
horizon, 
 assuming 
upward 
and 
downward 
yield 
curve 
shifts. 
The 
rate 
scenarios 
considered 
in 
these 
simulations 
reflect 
gradual 
upward 
and 
 downward 
interest 
rate 
movements 
of 
200 
basis 
points bps 
during 
a 
twelve-month 
period. 
The 
Corporation 
carries 
out 
the 
 simulations in two ways: 
 (1) Using a static balance sheet, as the Corporation had on the simulation date, and 
 (2) Using a dynamic balance sheet based on recent patterns and current strategies. 
 The balance 
sheet is 
divided into 
groups of 
assets and 
liabilities by 
maturity or 
re-pricing structure 
and their 
corresponding interest 
 yields and 
costs. As interest 
rates rise or 
fall, these 
simulations incorporate 
expected future 
lending rates, 
current and 
expected future 
 funding sources 
and costs, 
the possible 
exercise of 
options, changes 
in prepayment 
rates, deposit 
decay and 
other factors, 
which may 
 be important in projecting net interest income. 

 The Corporation uses 
a simulation model 
to project future movements 
in the Corporation s 
balance sheet and 
income statement. The 
 starting point of the projections 
corresponds to the actual 
values on the balance sheet 
on the date of the simulations. 
These simulations 
 are 
highly 
complex 
and 
are 
based 
on 
many 
assumptions 
that 
are 
intended 
to 
reflect 
the 
general 
behavior 
of 
the 
balance 
sheet 
 components over 
the modeled 
periods. It 
is unlikely 
that actual 
events will 
match these 
assumptions in 
all cases. 
For this 
reason, the 
 results 
of 
these 
forward-looking 
computations 
are 
only 
approximations 
of 
the 
true 
sensitivity 
of 
net 
interest 
income 
to 
changes 
in 
 market 
interest 
rates. 
Several 
benchmark 
and 
market 
rate 
curves 
were 
used 
in 
the 
modeling 
process, 
primarily 
the 
LIBOR/SWAP 
 curve, 
SOFR 
curve, 
Prime 
Rate, 
U.S. 
Treasury 
yield 
curve, 
FHLB 
rates, 
brokered 
CDs 
rates, 
repurchase 
agreements 
rates, 
and 
the 
 mortgage commitment rate of 30 years. 
 As of 
December 31, 
2022, the 
Corporation forecasted 
the 12-month 
net interest 
income assuming 
December 31, 
2022 interest 
rate 
 curves remain 
constant. Then, 
net interest 
income was 
estimated under 
rising and 
falling rates 
scenarios. For 
rising rates 
scenarios, a 
 gradual 
(ramp) 
parallel 
upward 
shift 
of 
the 
yield 
curve 
is 
assumed 
during 
the 
first 
twelve 
months 
(the 
 +200 
ramp 
scenario). 
 Conversely, 
for 
the 
falling 
rates 
scenario, 
a 
gradual 
(ramp) 
parallel 
downward 
shift 
of 
the 
yield 
curve 
is 
assumed 
during 
the 
first 
 twelve months (the -200 ramp scenario). 
 The 
LIBOR/Swap 
rates 
for 
December 
31, 
2022, 
as 
compared 
to 
the 
January 
31, 
2022 
rates 
used 
for 
the 
December 
31, 
2021 
 sensitivity 
analysis, 
reflected 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
short-term 
sector 
of 
the 
curve, 
that 
is 
between 
one 
to 
twelve 
months, 
of 
449 
basis 
 points bps 
on average; 
while market 
rates increased 
in the 
medium-term sector 
of the 
curve, that 
is between 
2 to 
5 years, 
by 274 
 bps. In the long-term sector, 
that is over 5-year maturities, market 
rates increased 196 bps as compared 
to January 31, 2022. 
A similar 
 pattern 
in 
market 
rates 
changes 
were 
observed 
in 
the 
Treasury 
and 
the 
SOFR 
curve 
of 
416 
and 
410 
bps 
in 
the 
short-term 
sector, 
 respectively, 282 and 247 
in the medium-term sector, respectively, 
and 200 and 167 bps in the long-term sector, respectively.

The Corporation 
continues to 
manage its 
balance sheet 
structure to 
control and 
limit the 
overall interest 
rate risk 
by managing 
its 
 asset composition 
while maintaining 
a sound 
liquidity position. 
As of 
December 31, 
2022 and 
2021, the 
simulations showed 
that the 
 Corporation continues to have an asset-sensitive position. 

As of December 31, 2022, the 
net interest income for the 
next twelve months under 
a non-static balance sheet scenario 
is estimated 
 to 
increase 
by 
 11.5 
million 
in 
the 
rising 
rate 
scenario, 
when 
compared 
against 
the 
base 
simulation. 
The 
decrease 
in 
net 
interest 
 income sensitivity 
for the +200 
bps ramp scenario, 
as compared to 
December 31, 2021, 
is primarily driven 
by the size 
and mix of 
the 
 balance 
sheet 
coupled 
with 
changes 
in 
market 
interest 
rates and 
its impact 
on deposit 
betas. As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
starting 
 point 
of 
the 
simulation 
reflects 
lower 
balances 
in 
more 
sensitive 
assets 
such 
as 
cash 
and 
cash 
equivalents 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
overall 
 decline in 
total deposits. 
In addition, 
the repricing 
of the 
more sensitive 
interest-bearing deposits, 
such as 
government deposits, 
have 
 resulted in increases in deposit betas which ultimately impact net interest income. 

As of December 31, 2022, 
under a falling rate, 
non-static balance sheet scenario, 
the net interest income 
is estimated to decrease 
 by 17.0 
million, when 
compared against 
the base 
simulation. 
The 
increase in 
net interest 
income 
sensitivity for 
the -200 
bps ramp 
 scenario, 
when compared to December 
31, 2021, was driven 
by higher sensitivity 
in the asset side as 
a result of rate 
decompression as 
 market rates move 
away from historically 
low interest rate 
levels, allowing for 
greater downward interest 
rate shifts, which 
more than 
 offset the aforementioned repricing of the more sensitive interest-bearing 
deposits described above. 

 Derivatives 

First 
BanCorp. 
uses derivative 
instruments 
and 
other 
strategies 
to 
manage 
its exposure 
to 
interest 
rate 
risk 
caused 
by 
changes 
in 
 interest rates beyond management s 
control. 

 As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022 
and 
2021, 
the 
Corporation 
considered 
all 
of 
its 
derivative 
instruments 
to 
be 
undesignated 
economic 
 hedges.

 Credit Risk Management 
 First BanCorp. 
is subject 
to 
credit 
risk 
mainly 
with 
respect to 
its portfolio 
of loans 
receivable 
and 
off-balance-sheet 
instruments, 
 principally 
loan 
commitments. 
Loans 
receivable 
represents 
loans 
that 
First 
BanCorp. 
holds 
for 
investment 
and, 
therefore, 
First 
 BanCorp. is at risk for 
the term of the loan. 
Loan commitments represent commitments 
to extend credit, subject 
to specific conditions, 
 for specific amounts 
and maturities. These commitments 
may expose the Corporation 
to credit risk and 
are subject to the 
same review 
 and 
approval 
process 
as 
for 
loans 
made 
by 
the 
Bank. 
See 
 Liquidity 
Risk 
and 
Capital 
Adequacy 
above 
for 
further 
details. 
The 
 Corporation 
manages 
its 
credit 
risk 
through 
its 
credit 
policy, 
underwriting, 
monitoring 
of 
loan 
concentrations 
and 
related 
credit 
 quality, 
counterparty 
credit 
risk, 
economic 
and 
market 
conditions, 
and 
legislative 
or 
regulatory 
mandates. 
The 
Corporation 
also 
 performs 
independent 
loan 
review 
and 
quality 
control 
procedures, 
statistical 
analysis, 
comprehensive 
financial 
analysis, 
established 
 management committees, 
and employs 
proactive collection 
and loss 
mitigation efforts. 
Furthermore, personnel 
performing structured 
 loan 
workout 
functions 
are 
responsible 
for 
mitigating 
defaults 
and 
minimizing 
losses 
upon 
default 
within 
each 
region 
and 
for 
each 
 business 
segment. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
the 
commercial 
and 
industrial, 
commercial 
mortgage 
and 
construction 
loan 
portfolios, 
the 
Special 
 Asset Group SAG 
focuses on strategies 
for the accelerated 
reduction of non-performing 
assets through note 
sales, short sales, loss 
 mitigation 
programs, 
and 
sales 
of 
OREO. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
management 
of 
the 
resolution 
process 
for 
problem 
loans, 
the 
SAG 
 oversees 
collection 
efforts 
for 
all 
loans 
to 
prevent 
migration 
to 
the 
nonaccrual 
and/or 
adversely 
classified 
status. 
The 
SAG 
utilizes 
 relationship officers, collection specialists and attorneys. 
 The 
Corporation 
may 
also 
have 
risk 
of 
default 
in 
the 
securities 
portfolio. 
The 
securities 
held 
by 
the 
Corporation 
are 
principally 
 fixed-rate U.S. agencies 
MBS and U.S. Treasury 
and agencies securities. Thus, 
a substantial portion 
of these instruments is 
backed by 
 mortgages, a guarantee of a U.S. GSE or the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. 
 Management, consisting of the 
Corporation s Commercial 
Credit Risk Officer, 
Retail Credit Risk Officer, 
Chief Credit Officer, 
and 
 other 
senior 
executives, 
has 
the 
primary 
responsibility 
for 
setting 
strategies 
to 
achieve 
the 
Corporation s 
credit 
risk 
goals 
and 
 objectives. Management has documented these goals and objectives in the Corporation s 
Credit Policy. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses and Non-performing Assets 
 Allowance for Credit Losses for Loans and 
Finance Leases 
 The ACL 
for loans 
and finance 
leases represents 
the estimate 
of the 
level of 
reserves appropriate 
to absorb 
expected credit 
losses 
 over the estimated life of the 
loans. The amount of the allowance 
is determined using relevant available 
information, from internal and 
 external sources, relating 
to past events, current 
conditions, and reasonable 
and supportable forecasts. 
Historical credit loss experience 
 is 
a 
significant 
input 
for 
the 
estimation 
of 
expected 
credit 
losses, 
as 
well 
as 
adjustments 
to 
historical 
loss 
information 
made 
for 
 differences in current loan-specific 
risk characteristics, such as differences 
in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, 
delinquency level, 
 or 
term. 
Additionally, 
the 
Corporation s 
assessment 
involves 
evaluating 
key 
factors, 
which 
include 
credit 
and 
macroeconomic 
 indicators, 
such as 
changes in 
unemployment 
rates, property 
values, and 
other relevant 
factors to 
account for 
current and 
forecasted 
 market conditions 
that are 
likely to 
cause estimated 
credit losses over 
the life 
of the 
loans to differ 
from historical 
credit losses. 
Such 
 factors are 
subject to 
regular review 
and may 
change to 
reflect updated 
performance trends 
and expectations, 
particularly in 
times of 
 severe 
stress. 
The 
process 
includes 
judgments 
and 
quantitative 
elements 
that 
may 
be 
subject 
to 
significant 
change. 
Further, 
the 
 Corporation periodically considers the need for qualitative 
reserves to the ACL. Qualitative adjustments may be related 
to and include, 
 but are 
not limited 
to, factors 
such as 
the following: 
(i) management s 
assessment of 
economic forecasts 
used in 
the model 
and how 
 those 
forecasts 
align 
with 
management s 
overall 
evaluation 
of 
current 
and 
expected 
economic 
conditions; 
(ii) 
organization 
specific 
 risks such 
as credit 
concentrations, 
collateral 
specific risks, 
nature 
and 
size of 
the portfolio 
and 
external 
factors that 
may 
ultimately 
 impact credit quality, 
and (iii) other 
limitations associated with 
factors such as 
changes in underwriting 
and loan resolution 
strategies, 
 among others. 
The ACL 
for loans 
and finance 
leases is 
reviewed at 
least on 
a quarterly 
basis as 
part of 
the Corporation s 
continued 
 evaluation of its asset quality. 
 During 2022, 
the Corporation 
applied probability 
weights to 
the baseline 
and alternative 
downside economic 
scenarios 
to estimate 
 the ACL with the baseline 
scenario carrying the highest 
weight. In weighting these 
macroeconomic scenarios, the 
Corporation applied 
 judgment based on a 
variety of factors such 
as economic uncertainties including 
continued conflict in Ukraine, 
the overall inflationary 
 environment, and 
a potential 
slowdown in 
economic activity 
as a 
result of 
the FED s 
policy actions 
to control 
inflationary economic 
 conditions. For 
periods prior 
to 2022, 
the Corporation 
calculated the 
ACL using 
the baseline 
scenario. As 
of December 
31, 2022, 
the 
 Corporation s 
ACL 
model 
considered 
the 
following 
assumptions 
for 
key 
economic 
variables 
in 
the 
probability-weighted 
economic 
 scenarios: 
 
 Average 
Commercial 
Real Estate 
Price 
Index forecast 
for 
the year 
2023 is 
expected to 
contract by 
2.96 , 
compared 
to an 
 average projected appreciation for 2023 of 8.68 as of December 31, 
2021. 

93 
 
 Average 
Regional 
Home 
Price Index 
forecast 
for year 
2023 in 
Puerto 
Rico (purchase 
only prices) 
shows a 
deterioration of 
 6.88 , when compared to the forecast for 2023 as of December 31, 2021. 
 
 An increase in levels of regional 
unemployment in Puerto Rico to 8.55 
for the year 2023, compared to the 
forecast for 2023 
 of 7.60 as of December 31, 2021. 
For the Florida region and the U.S. 
mainland, an increase in unemployment rate 
to 4.23 
 and 4.83 , respectively, 
for the year 2023, compared to 2.88 and 3.49 , respectively, 
for 2023 as of December 31, 2021. 

A decrease 
in real 
GDP in 
the U.S. 
mainland to 
0.26 
for the 
year 2023, 
compared to 
the forecast 
for 2023 
of 2.84 
as of 
 December 31, 2021. 
 It is difficult to estimate how potential changes 
in one factor or input might affect the overall ACL because 
management considers a 
 wide variety of 
factors and inputs in 
estimating the ACL. 
Changes in the 
factors and inputs considered 
may not occur 
at the same rate 
 and may not be consistent 
across all geographies or product 
types, and changes in factors 
and inputs may be directionally 
inconsistent, 
 such that improvement 
in one factor 
or input may 
offset deterioration 
in others. However, 
to demonstrate the 
sensitivity of 
credit loss 
 estimates to macroeconomic 
forecasts as of 
December 31, 
2022, management 
compared the modeled 
estimates under 
the probability-
 weighted 
economic 
scenarios 
against 
a 
more 
adverse 
scenario. 
Under 
this 
more 
adverse 
scenario, 
as 
an 
example, 
average 
 unemployment 
rate for 
the Puerto 
Rico region 
increases to 
9.16 for 
the year 
2023, compared 
to 8.55 
for the 
same period 
on the 
 probability-weighted economic scenario projections. 
 To 
demonstrate the sensitivity 
to key economic 
parameters used in 
the calculation of 
our ACL at December 
31, 2022, management 
 calculated 
the 
difference 
between 
our 
quantitative 
ACL 
and 
this 
more 
adverse 
scenario. 
Excluding 
consideration 
of 
qualitative 
 adjustments, this sensitivity analysis would result in a hypothetical 
increase in our ACL of approximately 41 
million at December 31, 
 2022. 
This analysis 
relates only 
to the 
modeled credit 
loss estimates 
and is 
not intended 
to estimate 
changes in 
the overall 
ACL as 
it 
 does 
not 
reflect 
any 
potential 
changes 
in 
other 
adjustments 
to 
the 
qualitative 
calculation, 
which 
would 
also 
be 
influenced 
by 
the 
 judgment 
management 
applies 
to 
the 
modeled 
lifetime 
loss 
estimates 
to 
reflect 
the 
uncertainty 
and 
imprecision 
of 
these 
estimates 
 based 
on 
current 
circumstances 
and 
conditions. 
Recognizing 
that 
forecasts 
of 
macroeconomic 
conditions 
are 
inherently 
uncertain, 
 particularly in light 
of the recent economic 
conditions and challenges, 
which continue to 
evolve, management believes 
that its process 
 to consider the available information and associated risks and 
uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its estimates 
of expected 
 credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended December 
31, 2022. 
 As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
ACL 
for 
loans 
and 
finance 
leases 
was 
 260.5 
million, 
down 
approximately 
 8.5 
million 
from 
 December 31, 
2021. The 
ACL reduction 
for commercial 
and construction 
loans was 
 20.8 
million during 
2022, primarily 
reflecting 
 reduced 
uncertainties 
related 
to 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic, 
particularly 
on 
loans 
in 
the 
hotel, 
transportation 
and 
entertainment 
 industries; 
and, 
to a 
lesser extent, 
the effect 
during 
the second 
half of 
2022 of 
reserve releases 
totaling 
 4.8 million 
associated with 
 two 
adversely 
classified 
loans 
that 
were 
paid 
off 
or 
sold, 
partially 
offset 
by 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
size 
of 
the 
loan 
portfolio 
and 
a 
less 
 favorable economic outlook in the 
projection of certain forecasted macroeconomic 
variables, such as the CRE price 
index. In addition, 
 there was an ACL reduction of 
 12.0 million for residential mortgage loans, 
partially offset by a 24.3 million 
increase in the ACL for 
 consumer loans. 
The net reduction 
in the 
ACL for residential 
mortgage loans 
was primarily 
driven by 
the overall 
decrease in 
the size 
 of this portfolio 
and, to a lesser extent, 
a decrease in qualitative 
adjustments due to improvements 
in underlying portfolio metrics. 
The 
 ACL increase 
for consumer 
loans was 
mainly driven 
by a 
less favorable 
long-term outlook 
of certain 
macroeconomic variables, 
such 
 as the regional unemployment rate, and an increasing trend in delinquency 
and charge-off levels in the consumer loan portfolios. 

 The ratio 
of the 
ACL for 
loans and 
finance leases 
to total 
loans held 
for investment 
decreased to 
2.25 
as of 
December 31, 
2022, 
 compared to 2.43 as of December 31, 2021. An explanation for the change 
for each portfolio follows: 
 
 The 
ACL 
to 
total 
loans 
ratio 
for 
the 
residential 
mortgage 
portfolio 
decreased 
from 
2.51 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2021 
to 
 2.20 as of December 
31, 2022, primarily due 
to a decrease in qualitative 
adjustments due to improvements 
in underlying 
 portfolio metrics. 
 
 The 
ACL to 
total 
loans 
ratio 
for 
the 
commercial 
mortgage 
portfolio 
decreased 
from 
2.43 as 
of 
December 
31, 
2021 
to 
 1.49 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
primarily 
reflecting 
reduced 
uncertainties 
related 
to 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic, 
as 
 previously discussed. 

The ACL 
to total 
loans ratio 
for 
the commercial 
and industrial 
portfolio 
was 1.14 
as of 
December 
31, 2022, 
relatively 
 flat when compared to 1.19 as of December 31, 2021
 .
 
 The ACL 
to total 
loans ratio for 
the construction 
loan portfolio 
decreased from 
2.91 as 
of December 
31, 2021 
to 1.74 
 as of December 
31, 2022, primarily 
reflecting reductions 
in qualitative reserves 
mostly associated 
to previously-identified 
 specific risks for a construction project in Florida that were resolved during the first quarter 
of 2022. 

94 
 
 The ACL 
to total 
loans ratio 
for the 
consumer loan 
portfolio increased 
from 3.57 
as of December 
31, 2021 
to 3.83 as 
 of December 
31, 2022, primarily 
associated to a 
less favorable long 
-term outlook of 
certain macroeconomic variables 
and 
 an increasing trend in delinquency and charge-off 
levels in the consumer loan portfolios. 
 The ratio 
of the 
total ACL 
for loans 
and finance 
leases to 
nonaccrual 
loans held 
for investment 
was 289.61 
as of 
December 31, 
 2022, 
compared to 242.99 
as of December 31, 2021. 

 Substantially all of 
the Corporation s 
loan portfolio is 
located within the 
boundaries of the 
U.S. economy. 
Whether the collateral 
is 
 located in 
Puerto Rico, 
the U.S. 
and British 
Virgin 
Islands, or 
the U.S. 
mainland (mainly 
in the 
state of 
Florida), the 
performance of 
 the Corporation s 
loan portfolio and 
the value of 
the collateral supporting 
the transactions are 
dependent upon the 
performance of and 
 conditions 
within each 
specific area s 
real estate 
market. The 
Corporation believes 
it sets 
adequate loan-to-value 
ratios following 
its 
 regulatory and credit policy standards. 

 As shown 
in the 
following tables, 
the ACL 
for loans 
and finance 
leases amounted 
to 260.5 
million as 
of December 
31, 2022, 
or 
 2.25 of 
total loans, 
compared with 
 269.0 million, 
or 2.43 
of total 
loans, as 
of December 
31, 2021.

 Allowance for Credit Losses for Unfunded Loan 
Commitments
 The Corporation estimates 
expected credit losses 
over the contractual 
period in which 
the Corporation is 
exposed to credit 
risk as a 
 result 
of 
a 
contractual 
obligation 
to 
extend 
credit, 
such as 
pursuant 
to unfunded 
loan 
commitments 
and 
standby 
letters of 
credit 
for 
 commercial and 
construction loans, 
unless the 
obligation is 
unconditionally cancellable 
by the 
Corporation. The 
ACL for 
off-balance 
 sheet 
credit 
exposures 
is 
adjusted 
as 
a 
provision 
for 
credit 
loss 
expense. 
As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
ACL 
for 
off-balance 
sheet 
 credit 
exposures 
increased 
by 2.7 
million 
to 4.3 
million, 
when 
compared 
to 
December 31, 
2021, 
mainly driven 
by an 
increase 
in 
 balance 
of 
unfunded 
loan 
commitments 
principally 
due 
to 
newly 
originated 
facilities 
which 
remained 
undrawn 
as 
of December 
31, 
 2022. 

 Allowance for Credit Losses for Held-to-Maturity 
Debt Securities
 As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
ACL 
for 
held-to-maturity 
securities 
portfolio 
was 
entirely 
related 
to 
financing 
arrangements 
with 
 Puerto 
Rico 
municipalities 
issued 
in 
bond 
form, 
which 
the 
Corporation 
accounts 
for 
as 
securities, 
but 
which 
were 
underwritten 
as 
 loans 
with 
features 
that 
are 
typically 
found 
in 
commercial 
loans. 
As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
ACL 
for 
held-to-maturity 
debt 
 securities was 8.3 million, compared to 8.6 million as of December 31, 
2021. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses for Available 
-for-Sale Debt Securities 
 
The 
ACL 
for 
available-for-sale 
debt 
securities, 
which 
is 
associated 
with 
private 
label 
MBS 
and 
a 
residential 
pass-through 
MBS 
 issued by the PRHFA, was 0.5 
million as of December 31, 2022, compared to 1.1 million as of December 31, 2021. 

96 
 Nonaccrual Loans and Non-performing Assets 
 Total 
non-performing 
assets consist 
of 
nonaccrual 
loans (generally 
loans held 
for 
investment 
or loans 
held 
for 
sale on 
which 
the 
 recognition of 
interest income 
was discontinued 
when the 
loan became 
90 days 
past due 
or earlier 
if the 
full and 
timely collection 
of 
 interest or principal 
is uncertain), foreclosed 
real estate and 
other repossessed properties, 
and non-performing 
investment securities, if 
 any. 
When a 
loan is placed 
in nonaccrual 
status, any 
interest previously 
recognized and 
not collected 
is reversed 
and charged 
against 
 interest 
income. 
Cash 
payments 
received 
are 
recognized 
when 
collected 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
contractual 
terms 
of 
the 
loans. 
The 
 principal 
portion 
of the 
payment is 
used to 
reduce 
the principal 
balance 
of the 
loan, 
whereas the 
interest portion 
is recognized 
on a 
 cash basis 
(when collected). 
However, 
when management 
believes that 
the ultimate 
collectability of 
principal is 
in doubt, 
the interest 
 portion 
is 
applied 
to 
the 
outstanding 
principal. 
The 
risk 
exposure 
of 
this 
portfolio 
is 
diversified 
as 
to 
individual 
borrowers 
and 
 industries, among 
other factors. In 
addition, a large 
portion is secured 
with real estate 
collateral. See Note 
1 Nature 
of Business and 
 Summary 
of Significant 
Accounting Policies, 
to the 
audited consolidated 
financial statements 
included 
in Item 
8 of 
this Form 
10-K, 
 for additional information. 
 Nonaccrual Loans Policy
 Residential Real Estate Loans
 
 The Corporation generally classifies real estate loans in nonaccrual 
status when it has not received 
 interest and principal for a period of 90 days or more. 
 Commercial 
and 
Construction 
Loans

The 
Corporation 
classifies 
commercial 
loans 
(including 
commercial 
real 
estate 
and 
 construction loans) in nonaccrual 
status when it has not 
received interest and principal 
for a period of 90 
days or more or when 
it does 
 not expect to collect all of the principal or interest due to deterioration in the financial condition 
of the borrower. 
 Finance Leases
 
 The Corporation 
classifies finance leases 
in nonaccrual status 
when it has not 
received interest and 
principal for 
 a period of 90 days or more. 
 Consumer Loans
 
 The Corporation 
classifies consumer 
loans in nonaccrual 
status when it 
has not received 
interest and 
principal 
 for a period of 90 days or more. Credit card loans continue to accrue finance 
charges and fees until charged-off at 180 
days delinquent. 
 Purchased Credit 
Deteriorated Loans 
 For PCD loans, the nonaccrual 
status is determined in the 
same manner as for other loans, 
 except for PCD loans that 
prior to the adoption of 
CECL were classified as purchased 
credit impaired PCI loans 
and accounted for 
 under ASC 
Subtopic 
310-30, Receivables 
 Loans 
and Debt 
Securities Acquired 
with Deteriorated 
Credit Quality 
(ASC Subtopic 
 310-30). As allowed by CECL, 
the Corporation elected to maintain 
pools of loans accounted for under 
ASC Subtopic 310-30 as units 
 of 
accounts, 
conceptually 
treating 
each 
pool 
as 
a 
single 
asset. 
Regarding 
interest 
income 
recognition, 
the 
prospective 
transition 
 approach 
for 
PCD 
loans 
was 
applied 
at 
a 
pool 
level, 
which 
froze 
the 
effective 
interest 
rate 
of 
the 
pools 
as 
of 
January 
1, 
2020. 
 According 
to 
regulatory 
guidance, 
the 
determination 
of 
nonaccrual 
or 
accrual 
status 
for 
PCD 
loans 
with 
respect 
to 
which 
the 
 Corporation 
has 
made 
a 
policy 
election 
to 
maintain 
previously 
existing 
pools 
upon 
adoption 
of 
CECL 
should 
be 
made 
at 
the 
pool 
 level, 
not 
the 
individual 
asset 
level. 
In 
addition, 
the 
guidance 
provides 
that 
the 
Corporation 
can 
continue 
accruing 
interest 
and 
not 
 report 
the PCD 
loans as 
being 
in nonaccrual 
status if 
the following 
criteria are 
met: (i) 
the Corporation 
can reasonably 
estimate 
the 
 timing and amounts of 
cash flows expected to 
be collected; and (ii) 
the Corporation did not 
acquire the asset primarily 
for the rewards 
 of ownership 
of the 
underlying collateral, 
such as 
the use 
in operations 
or improving 
the collateral 
for resale. 
Thus, the 
Corporation 
 continues to exclude these pools of PCD loans from nonaccrual loan statistics. 
 Other Real Estate Owned
 OREO 
acquired 
in 
settlement 
of 
loans 
is 
carried 
at 
fair 
value 
less 
estimated 
costs 
to 
sell 
the 
real 
estate 
acquired. 
Appraisals 
are 
 obtained periodically, 
generally on an annual basis. 
 Other Repossessed Property
 The 
other 
repossessed 
property 
category 
generally 
included 
repossessed 
boats 
and 
autos 
acquired 
in 
settlement 
of 
loans. 
 Repossessed boats and autos are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value. 
 Other Non-Performing Assets
 This 
category 
consisted 
of a 
residential 
pass-through 
MBS 
issued 
by 
the 
PRHFA placed 
in 
non-performing 
status 
in 
the 
second 
 quarter of 2021 based on the delinquency status of the underlying second 
mortgage loans. 

97 
 Loans Past-Due 90 Days and Still Accruing 
 These are accruing loans 
that are contractually delinquent 
90 days or more. These 
past-due loans are either 
current as to interest but 
 delinquent as to the 
payment of principal (i.e., 
well secured and in process 
of collection) or are 
insured or guaranteed under 
applicable 
 FHA, 
VA, 
or 
other 
government-guaranteed 
programs 
for 
residential 
mortgage 
loans. 
Furthermore, 
as 
required 
by 
instructions 
in 
 regulatory 
reports, 
loans 
past 
due 
90 
days 
and 
still 
accruing 
include 
loans 
previously 
pooled 
into 
GNMA 
securities 
for 
which 
the 
 Corporation 
has 
the 
option 
but 
not 
the 
obligation 
to 
repurchase 
loans 
that 
meet 
GNMA s 
specified 
delinquency 
criteria 
(e.g., 
 borrowers 
fail 
to 
make 
any 
payment 
for 
three 
consecutive 
months). 
For 
accounting 
purposes, 
these 
GNMA 
loans 
subject 
to 
the 
 repurchase 
option 
are required 
to 
be 
reflected 
on 
the 
financial statements 
with 
an 
offsetting 
liability. 
In 
addition, 
loans past 
due 
90 
 days 
and 
still accruing 
include 
PCD loans, 
as mentioned 
above, and 
credit cards 
that continue 
accruing 
interest until 
charged-off 
at 
 180 days. 

 Troubled 
debt 
restructurings TDRs 
are 
classified 
as 
either 
accrual 
or 
nonaccrual 
loans. 
A 
loan 
in 
nonaccrual 
status 
and 
 restructured 
as 
a 
TDR 
will 
remain 
in 
nonaccrual 
status 
until 
the 
borrower 
has 
proven 
the 
ability 
to 
perform 
under 
the 
modified 
 structure, generally 
for a 
minimum of 
six months, 
and there 
is evidence 
that such 
payments can 
and are 
likely to 
continue as 
agreed. 
 The 
Corporation 
considers 
performance 
prior 
to 
the 
restructuring, 
or 
significant 
events 
that 
coincide 
with 
the 
restructuring, 
in 
 assessing whether the borrower can meet the new terms, 
which may result in the loan being returned to 
accrual status at the time of the 
 restructuring 
or 
after 
a 
shorter 
performance 
period. 
If 
the 
borrower s 
ability 
to 
meet 
the 
revised 
payment 
schedule 
is uncertain, 
the 
 loan remains classified as a nonaccrual loan.

 respectively.

 Residential pass-through MBS issued by the PRHFA

portfolio. 
 (3) 
 Includes 
PCD 
loans 
previously 
accounted 
for under 
ASC 
Subtopic 
310-30 
for which 
the 
Corporation 
made 
the 
accounting 
policy 
election 
of 
maintaining 
pools 
of loans 
as 
 units 
of 
 account both 
at the 
time of 
adoption of 
CECL on 
January 1, 
2020 and 
on an 
ongoing basis 
for credit 
loss measurement. 
These loans 
will continue 
to be 
excluded from 
nonaccrual loan 
 statistics as long as the Corporation can reasonably estimate 
the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be 
collected on the loan pools. The portion of such loans 
contractually past due 
 90 days or more amounted to 12.0 million and 20.6 million as 
of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 (4) 
 Includes FHA/VA 
government-guaranteed residential mortgage as 
loans past-due 90 days 
and still accruing as opposed 
to nonaccrual loans. The 
Corporation continues accruing interest 
on 
 these loans until they have 
passed the 15 months 
delinquency mark, taking into 
consideration the FHA interest 
curtailment process. These 
balances include 28.2 million 
and 46.6 million 
 of FHA government guaranteed residential mortgage loans that 
were over 15 months delinquent as of December 31, 2022 and 
2021, respectively. 
 (5) 
 Includes rebooked 
loans, which 
were previously 
pooled into 
GNMA securities, 
amounting to 
 10.3 million 
and 7.2 
million as 
of December 
31, 2022 
and 2021, 
respectively. 
Under the 
 GNMA program, the 
Corporation has the 
option but not the 
obligation to repurchase 
loans that meet 
GNMA s 
specified delinquency 
criteria. For accounting 
purposes, the loans 
subject to 
 the repurchase option are required to be reflected on the 
financial statements with an offsetting liability. 

98 
 Total 
nonaccrual loans 
were 89.9 
million as 
of December 
31, 2022. 
This represents 
a net 
decrease of 
 20.8 million 
from 110.7 
 million as 
of December 
31, 2021. 
The net 
decrease was 
primarily related 
to a 
 12.8 million 
reduction in 
nonaccrual commercial 
and 
 construction loans, 
mostly driven by 
 8.5 million in 
loans returned to 
accrual status and 
 8.5 million in 
collections, partially offset 
by 
 inflows of 5.7 
million. In addition, 
nonaccrual residential mortgage 
loans decreased 
by 12.3 million 
mainly related to 
 15.4 million 
 of loans 
restored to 
accrual status, 
 11.8 
million in 
collections, and 
 3.9 million 
in loans 
transferred to 
OREO during 
2022, partially 
 offset 
by 
inflows 
of 
 20.3 
million. 
These 
variances 
were 
partially 
offset 
by 
a 
 4.3 
million 
increase 
in 
nonaccrual 
consumer 
loans, 
 mostly related to the continued trend of growth in the auto loan and finance 
leases portfolios.

 Nonaccrual commercial mortgage loans 
decreased by 3.0 million to 
 22.3 million as of December 
31, 2022, from 25.3 million 
as 
 of December 31, 
2021. The decrease was 
primarily associated to 
collections and loans 
restored to accrual status 
during 2022, partially 
 offset 
by 
the 
migration 
to 
nonaccrual 
status 
of 
a 
 2.9 
million 
commercial 
mortgage 
loan 
related 
to 
the 
health 
care 
industry 
in 
the 
 Puerto Rico region. 
 Nonaccrual commercial and industrial 
loans decreased by 9.3 million to 
 7.8 million as of December 31, 2022, 
from 17.1 million 
 as of 
December 31, 
2021. The 
decrease was 
primarily 
associated with 
loans restored 
to accrual 
status during 
2022, including 
a 5.2 
 million 
commercial 
and 
industrial 
loan 
in 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
region, 
and 
collections, 
including 
the 
repayment 
of 
a 
 1.2 
million 
 commercial and industrial 
loan in the 
Puerto Rico region. 
This variance was 
partially offset 
by inflows, including 
the inflow of 
a 1.1 
 million commercial and industrial loan related to the entertainment industry 
in the Puerto Rico region. 
 Nonaccrual 
construction 
loans 
decreased 
by 
 0.5 
million 
to 
 2.2 
million 
as 
of 
December 
31,

from 
 2.7

as 
of 
 December 31, 2021. 

The following tables present the activity of commercial and construction

 12.3 million 
to 42.8 
million as 
of December 
31, 2022, 
compared to 
 55.1 
 million as of December 31, 
2021. The decrease was primarily related 
to loans restored to accrual status 
of 15.4 million, 11.8 
million 
 in collections, 
including the 
payoff of 
an individual 
loan of 
approximately 1.3 
million, foreclosures

million, and 
charge-offs 
 of 1.6 million 
during the year

 For the year ended December 31, 2021, includes net charge 
-offs totaling 23.1 million associated with the 
bulk sale of residential mortgage nonaccrual loans and related servicing advance 
 receivables. 

 The amount of 
nonaccrual consumer loans, 
including finance leases, increased 
by 4.3 million to 
 14.8 million as of 
December 31, 
 2022, 
compared 
to 
 10.5 
million 
as of 
December 
31, 
2021. 
The 
increase 
was 
mainly 
reflected 
in 
the 
auto 
loans 
and 
finance 
leases 
 portfolio. 
 As of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
approximately 
 15.3 
million 
of the 
loans 
placed 
in nonaccrual 
status, 
mainly 
commercial 
loans, were 
 current, or had delinquencies 
of less than 90 
days in their interest payments, 
including 7.8 million 
of TDRs maintained in 
nonaccrual 
 status 
until 
the 
restructured 
loans 
meet 
the 
criteria 
of 
sustained 
payment 
performance 
under 
the 
revised 
terms 
for 
reinstatement 
to 
 accrual 
status and 
there 
is no 
doubt 
about 
full 
collectability. 
Collections 
on 
these 
loans 
are 
being 
recorded 
on 
a 
cash basis 
through 
 earnings, or on a cost-recovery basis, as conditions warrant. 
 
During 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022, 
interest 
income 
of 
approximately 
 0.9 
million 
related 
to 
nonaccrual 
loans 
with 
a 
 carrying value 
of 24.1 
million as 
of December 
31, 2022, mainly 
nonaccrual commercial 
and construction 
loans, was applied 
against 
 the related principal balances under the cost-recovery method. 

101 
 Total loans in early 
delinquency i.e.
 , 30-89 days past due loans, as defined in regulatory reporting 
instructions) amounted to 104.9 
 million as of December 31, 2022, 
an increase of 14.6 million, compared 
to 90.3 million as of December 31, 
2021. 
The variances by 
 major portfolio categories were as follows: 

Consumer loans 
in early delinquency 
increased by 21.5 
million to 70.9 
million as of 
December 31, 
2022, mainly reflected 
 in auto loans. 
 
 Residential mortgage loans in early delinquency decreased by 6.0 
million to 28.2 million as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Commercial and construction loans in early delinquency decreased 
by 0.9 million to 5.8 million as of December 31, 2022. 
 In addition, 
the Corporation 
provides 
homeownership 
preservation 
assistance to 
its customers 
through 
a loss 
mitigation 
program. 
 Depending 
upon 
the 
nature 
of 
borrowers 
financial 
condition, 
restructurings 
or 
loan 
modifications 
through 
this 
program, 
as 
well 
as 
 other restructurings of 
individual commercial, commercial 
mortgage, construction, and 
residential mortgage loans, 
fit the definition 
of 
 a 
TDR. 
A 
restructuring 
of 
a 
debt 
constitutes 
a 
TDR 
if 
the 
creditor, 
for 
economic 
or 
legal 
reasons 
related 
to 
the 
debtor s 
financial 
 difficulties, 
grants a 
concession to 
the debtor 
that it 
would not 
otherwise consider. 
Modifications involve 
changes in 
one or 
more of 
 the 
loan 
terms 
that 
bring 
a 
defaulted 
loan 
current 
and 
provide 
sustainable 
affordability. 
Changes 
may 
include, 
among 
others, 
the 
 extension of the 
maturity of the 
loan and modifications 
of the loan 
rate. As of 
December 31, 2022, 
the Corporation s 
total TDR loans 
 held 
for 
investment 
amounted 
to 
 366.7 
million, 
a 
decrease 
of 
 48.0 
million 
from 
 414.7 
million 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2021. 
The 
 decrease was mainly related to payoffs and paydowns of 
residential mortgage and commercial and industrial loans. 
 See Note 4 
- Loans Held 
for Investment, 
to the audited 
consolidated financial 
statements included 
in Item 8 
of this Form 
10-K, for 
 additional information and statistics about the Corporation s 
TDR loans. 
 To 
assist 
borrowers 
affected 
by 
the 
passing 
of 
Hurricane 
Fiona 
through 
Puerto 
Rico 
on 
September 
17, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
 established 
a 
Natural 
Disaster 
Deferral 
or 
Extension 
Program, 
with 
a 
term 
that 
did 
not 
extend 
beyond 
December 
31, 
2022, 
for 
 residents of Puerto 
Rico that were 
directly impacted 
by the passing 
of the hurricane. 
This program provided 
payment deferral 
or term 
 extension 
on a 
one payment 
basis, that 
did not 
exceed three 
payments, 
to retail 
borrowers i.e.
 , borrowers 
with personal 
loans, auto 
 loans, finance 
leases, credit 
cards and 
residential mortgage 
loans) that 
contacted the 
Corporation by 
October 31, 
2022, to 
request the 
 payment extension. 
Loans continued 
to accrue 
interest during 
the deferral 
or extension 
period. For 
credit cards, 
borrowers who 
were 
 30 days or 
less past due 
as of September 
16, 2022 were 
eligible for this 
program. For residential 
mortgage loans and 
consumer loans, 
 borrowers 
who 
were 
60 
days 
or 
less 
past 
due 
as 
of 
September 
16, 
2022 
were 
eligible 
for 
this 
program. 
For 
both 
consumer 
and 
 residential mortgage 
loans subject 
to the 
deferral programs, 
each borrower 
was required 
to opt 
in on 
a monthly 
basis to 
the program 
 and 
had 
to 
resume 
making 
their regularly 
scheduled 
loan 
payments 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
deferral 
period. 
For 
consumer 
loans, 
deferred 
 amounts extended the 
maturity date by 
the number of 
deferred periods. For 
residential mortgage loans, 
deferred amounts were 
moved 
 to 
the 
end 
of 
the 
loan 
term. 
Borrowers 
that 
made 
a 
payment 
during 
any 
given 
month 
were 
not 
eligible 
for 
the 
program 
during 
that 
 month. 
Furthermore, 
for 
customers 
that 
opted 
into 
the 
program, 
the 
delinquency 
status of 
loans 
subject 
to 
the 
deferral 
or 
extension 
 program was frozen to the status that existed in the month prior to the relief granted. 

 Loans 
subject 
to 
the 
above-described 
program 
were 
not 
considered 
TDRs 
since 
the 
deferral 
or 
extension 
was 
considered 
 insignificant. 
Borrowers 
were 
eligible 
for 
payment 
deferral 
or 
extension 
of 
three 
payments 
only 
if 
cumulative 
payment 
extensions 
 granted 
during 
the 
last 
12 
months 
did 
not 
exceed 
six 
payments, 
including 
the 
extensions 
granted 
through 
this 
program. 
As 
of 
 December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
entered 
into 
deferral 
or 
extension 
payment 
agreements 
on 
consumer 
and 
residential 
mortgage 
 loans totaling 
 73.1 million 
pursuant to 
this program. 
Customers who 
were unable 
to resume 
making their 
contractual loan 
payments 
 upon 
exiting 
from 
these 
deferral 
programs 
may 
require 
further 
assistance 
and 
may 
receive 
or 
be 
eligible 
to 
receive 
modifications, 
 which could be considered TDRs.

totaled 
 34.2 million 
for 
the year 
ended December 
31, 2022, 
or 0.31 
of average

an annualized 
basis, 
 compared to 55.1 
million, or annualized 
0.48 of average 
loans for the 
year ended December

bulk sale of nonaccrual 
 residential mortgage 
loans added 
 23.1 
million in 
net charge-off 
s 
for the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2021. Excluding 
the effect 
of net 
 charge-offs 
related to the bulk sale, total net charge-offs in 2021 
were 32.0 million, or 0.28 of average loans. 

Residential mortgage 
loans net 
charge-offs 
for the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2022 were 
 3.3 million, 
or an 
annualized 0.12 
of 
 average residential loans, compared to 28.5 million, 
or an annualized 0.87 of average residential mortgage 
loans, for the year ended 
 December 31, 2021. 
Excluding the effect 
of net charge 
-offs related 
to the bulk 
sale, residential mortgage 
loans net charge-offs 
for the 
 year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2021 
were 
 5.4 
million, 
or 
0.17 
of 
average 
residential 
mortgage 
loans. 
Approximately 
 1.4 
million 
in 
 charge-offs 
recorded 
during 
2022 
resulted 
from 
valuations 
of 
collateral 
dependent 
residential 
mortgage 
loans, 
compared 
to 
 5.7 
 million in 
2021. Net 
charge-offs 
on residential 
mortgage loans 
also included 
 2.6 million 
during the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2022 
 related to foreclosures recorded in 2022, compared to 2.8 million recorded 
for the same period in 2021.

Commercial 
mortgage 
loans net 
recoveries 
for 
the year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022 were 
 1.3 
million, 
or 
an annualized 
0.06 
of 
 average commercial mortgage 
loans, compared to 
net charge-offs 
of 1.2 million, or 
an annualized 0.06 
of related average 
loans for 
 the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2021. 
Commercial 
mortgage 
loans 
net 
recoveries 
for 
2022 
included 
recoveries 
totaling 
 1.2 
million 
 associated with two commercial mortgage relationships. 
 Commercial and industrial loans net recoveries 
for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 0.4 
million, or an annualized 0.01 of 
 average commercial and industrial loans, compared to 4.9 million, 
or an annualized 0.16 of related average loans for the year ended 
 December 31, 
2021. The 
lower net 
recoveries for 
2022 
reflects both 
the effect 
of a 
 1.7 million 
charge-off 
recognized in 
connection 
 with 
the 
sale of 
an 
adversely classified 
commercial 
and 
industrial 
loan 
participation 
in 
the 
Florida 
region 
in 
2022 
and 
the 
effect 
in 
 2021 of 
a 5.2 million 
loan loss recovery 
recognized in 
connection with the 
paydown of a 
nonaccrual commercial 
and industrial loan 
 participation in the Puerto Rico region. 
 Construction 
loans 
net 
recoveries 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022 
were 
 0.6 
million, 
or 
an 
annualized 
0.49 
of 
average 
 construction loans, 
compared to 
 0.1 million, 
or an 
annualized 0.04 
of related 
average loans, 
for the 
same period 
in 2021. 
The net 
 recoveries for 2022 included a 0.5 million loan loss recovery 
of a construction loan in the Puerto Rico region. 

 Net 
charge-offs 
of 
consumer 
loans 
and 
finance 
leases 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022 
were 
 33.2 
million, 
or 
1.07 
of 
 related 
average 
loans, 
compared 
to 
 30.4 
million, 
or 
1.11 
of 
related 
average 
loans, 
for 2021 
. 
The 
increase 
in 
2022 was 
primarily 
 reflected in the personal 
loan portfolio, when compared 
to the same period 
in 2021. Notwithstanding, 
the net charge-off 
ratio for 2022 
 decreased due to a higher average balance of loans held-in-portfolio 
that more than offset the increase in net charge-offs.

 Operational Risk 
 The 
Corporation 
faces 
ongoing 
and 
emerging 
risk 
and 
regulatory 
pressure 
related 
to 
the 
activities 
that 
surround 
the 
delivery 
of 
 banking 
and 
financial 
products. 
Coupled 
with 
external 
influences, 
such 
as 
market 
conditions, 
security 
risks, 
and 
legal 
risks, 
the 
 potential for 
operational and 
reputational loss 
has increased. 
To 
mitigate and 
control operational 
risk, the 
Corporation has 
developed, 
 and continues 
to enhance, specific 
internal controls, 
policies and procedures 
that are designed 
to identify and 
manage operational 
risk 
 at 
appropriate 
levels 
throughout 
the 
organization. 
The 
purpose 
of 
these 
mechanisms 
is 
to 
provide 
reasonable 
assurance 
that 
the 
 Corporation s business operations 
are functioning within the policies and limits established by management.
 The 
Corporation 
classifies operational 
risk 
into 
two 
major 
categories: 
business-specific 
and 
corporate-wide 
affecting 
all business 
 lines. 
For 
business 
specific 
risks, 
a 
risk 
assessment 
group 
works 
with 
the 
various 
business 
units 
to 
ensure 
consistency 
in 
policies, 
 processes 
and 
assessments. 
With 
respect 
to 
corporate-wide 
risks, 
such 
as 
information 
security, 
business 
recovery, 
and 
legal 
and 
 compliance, the 
Corporation has specialized 
groups, such 
as the Legal 
Department, Information 
Security, 
Corporate Compliance, 
and 
 Operations. These groups 
assist the lines of 
business in the 
development and implementation 
of risk management 
practices specific to 
 the needs of the business groups.
 Legal and Compliance Risk 
 Legal and compliance risk includes 
the risk of noncompliance with applicable 
legal and regulatory requirements, 
the risk of adverse 
 legal 
judgments 
against 
the 
Corporation, 
and 
the 
risk 
that 
a 
counterparty s 
performance 
obligations 
will 
be 
unenforceable. 
The 
 Corporation 
is 
subject 
to 
extensive 
regulation 
in 
the 
different 
jurisdictions 
in 
which 
it 
conducts 
its 
business, 
and 
this 
regulatory 
 scrutiny has 
been significantly 
increasing over 
the years. 
The Corporation 
has established, 
and continues 
to enhance, 
procedures that 
 are designed 
to ensure 
compliance with 
all applicable 
statutory, 
regulatory 
and any 
other legal 
requirements. 
The Corporation 
has a 
 Compliance 
Director 
who 
reports 
to 
the 
Chief 
Risk 
Officer 
and 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
oversight 
of 
regulatory 
compliance 
and 
 implementation 
of an 
enterprise-wide compliance 
risk assessment 
process. 
The Compliance 
division 
has officer 
roles in 
each major 
 business area with direct reporting responsibilities to the Corporate Compliance 
Group. 
 Concentration Risk 
 The Corporation conducts 
its operations in 
a geographically concentrated 
area, as its main 
market is Puerto 
Rico. Of the total 
gross 
 loan portfolio 
held for investment 
of 11.6 
billion as of 
December 31, 2022, 
the Corporation had 
credit risk of 
approximately 79 
in 
 the Puerto Rico region, 18 in the United States region, and 3 in the Virgin 
Islands region. 
 Update on the Puerto Rico Fiscal and Economic Situation 
 A significant 
portion of 
the Corporation s 
business activities 
and credit 
exposure is 
concentrated in 
the Commonwealth 
of Puerto 
 Rico, which 
has experienced 
economic and 
fiscal distress 
over the 
last decade. 
Since declaring 
bankruptcy and 
benefitting from 
the 
 enactment of the federal Puerto 
Rico Oversight, Management and 
Economic Stability Act PROMESA in 
2016, the Government of 
 Puerto 
Rico 
has 
made 
progress 
on 
fiscal 
matters 
primarily 
by 
restructuring 
a 
large 
portion 
of 
its 
outstanding 
public 
debt 
and 
 identifying funding sources for its unfunded pension system. 
 Economic Indicators 
 On 
November 
10, 
2022, 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
Planning 
Board PRPB 
presented 
the 
Economic 
Report 
to 
the 
Governor, 
which 
 provides 
an 
analysis 
of 
Puerto 
Rico s 
economy 
during 
fiscal 
year 
2021 
and 
a 
short-term 
forecast 
for 
fiscal 
years 
2022 
and 
2023. 
 According to the 
PRPB, Puerto Rico s 
real gross national 
product GNP expanded 
by 1.0 in fiscal 
year 2021, significantly 
above 
 the PRPB s 
original 
baseline projection 
of a 
2.0 
contraction. According 
to the 
report, real 
GNP growth 
was primarily 
driven by 
a 
 sharp increase 
in personal 
consumption expenditures 
reflecting the 
relaxation of 
COVID-related restrictions, 
as well 
as the 
impact of 
 the 
substantial 
disaster 
relief funding 
deployed 
over 
the period. 
To 
a 
lesser extent, 
growth 
in 
fiscal 
year 
2021 
was also 
driven 
by a 
 higher level of 
investments in machinery, 
equipment, and construction. 
These favorable variances 
were partially offset 
by an increase 
 in imports, 
a reduction 
in exports, and 
a negative 
change in the 
level of 
inventories. According 
to the PRPB s 
baseline projection 
the 
 Puerto Rico 
economy is 
forecasted to 
continue growing 
for fiscal 
years 2022 
and 2023. 
Among the 
key assumptions 
included in 
this 
 forecast 
is the 
positive 
impact 
expected 
from 
the ongoing 
disbursements 
of disaster 
recovery 
funds 2.8 
billion 
and 4.0 
billion 
in 
 fiscal years 2022 and 
2023, respectively), 
as well as the 
stimulus from remaining pandemic 
relief funds 1.1 billion 
and 632 million 
 in 
fiscal 
years 
2022 
and 
2023, 
respectively), 
and 
the 
inclusion 
of 
Puerto 
Rico 
in 
the 
Earned 
Income 
Tax 
Credit 
and 
the 
Child 
Tax 
 Credit. 

 There 
are 
other 
indicators 
that 
gauge 
economic 
activity 
and 
are 
published 
with 
greater 
frequency, 
for 
example, 
the 
Economic 
 Development 
Bank 
for 
Puerto 
Rico s 
Economic 
Activity 
Index EDB-EAI ). 
Although 
not 
a 
direct 
measure 
of 
Puerto 
Rico s 
real 
 GNP, 
the 
EDB-EAI 
is correlated 
to 
Puerto 
Rico s 
real 
GNP. 
For 
December 
2022, 
preliminary 
estimates 
showed 
that the 
EDB-EAI 
 increased 
1.6 
and 
0.6 
on 
a 
month-over-month 
and 
year-over-year 
basis, 
respectively. 
Similarly, 
for 
calendar 
year 
2022, 
the 

107 
 preliminary data 
reflects that 
the index 
averaged 124.4 
during the 
year, 
which would 
represent a 
1.8 increase 
from the 
comparable 
 figure in 2021. 
 Fiscal Plan 

On 
January 
27, 
2022, 
the 
PROMESA 
oversight 
board 
certified 
the 
2022 
Fiscal 
Plan 
for 
Puerto 
Rico. 
Similar 
to 
previous 
fiscal 
 plans, 
the 
2022 
Fiscal 
Plan 
incorporates 
updated 
information 
related 
to 
the 
macroeconomic 
environment, 
as 
well 
as 
government 
 revenues, 
expenditures, 
structural 
reform 
efforts, 
and 
recent 
increases 
in 
federal 
funding. 
More 
importantly, 
the 
2022 
Fiscal 
Plan 
 reflects the 
Commonwealth 
Plan of 
Adjustment confirmed 
by the 
U.S. District 
Court for 
the District 
of Puerto 
Rico. Relative 
to the 
 previous 
fiscal 
plan, 
the 
2022 
Fiscal 
Plan 
incorporates 
a 
new 
set 
of 
expenditure 
projections 
that 
factor 
in 
the 
now-established 
debt 
 service 
requirements 
pursuant 
to 
the 
Plan 
of 
Adjustment, 
as 
well 
as 
additional 
investments 
enabled 
by 
the 
increased 
resources 
 available 
to the 
government. 
Accordingly, 
the 2022 
Fiscal Plan 
projects 
unrestricted 
surplus 
after debt 
service to 
average 1 
billion 
 annually 
between 
fiscal 
years 
2022 
and 
2031. 
The 
2022 
Fiscal 
Plan 
prioritizes 
resource 
allocations 
across 
three 
major 
themes: 
(i) 
 investing in 
the operational 
capacity of 
the government 
to deliver 
services with 
Civil Service 
Reform, (ii) 
prioritizing obligations 
to 
 current and future retirees, and (iii) creating a fiscally responsible post-bankruptcy 
government. 
 The 
2022 
Fiscal 
Plan 
contains 
an 
updated 
macroeconomic 
forecast 
that 
reflects 
the 
adverse 
impact 
of 
the 
pandemic-induced 
 recession at 
the end of 
fiscal year 
2020, followed 
by a 
forecasted rebound 
and recovery 
in fiscal years 
2021 through 
2023. Similar 
to 
 the 
previous 
fiscal 
plan, 
the 
2022 
Fiscal 
Plan 
incorporates 
a 
real 
growth 
series 
that 
was 
adjusted 
for 
the 
short-term 
income 
effects 
 resulting from 
the extraordinary 
unemployment insurance 
and other pandemic 
-related direct transfer 
programs. Specifically, 
the 2022 
 Fiscal Plan 
estimates that 
Puerto Rico s 
GNP will 
grow by 
5.2 in 
fiscal year 
2022, followed 
by a 
0.6 growth 
in fiscal 
year 2023. 
 Excluding 
the 
effect 
on 
household 
income 
from 
the 
unprecedented 
pandemic-related 
federal 
government 
stimulus, 
the 
2022 
Fiscal 
 Plan estimates that real GNP growth would be 2.6 and 0.9 in fiscal years 2022 
and 2023, respectively. 
 Over the 
past few 
years, Puerto 
Rico has 
benefited from 
historical levels 
of federal 
support, creating 
new opportunities 
to address 
 high-priority needs. 
The 2022 
Fiscal Plan 
projects that 
approximately 84 
billion of 
disaster relief 
funding in 
total, from 
federal and 
 private sources, will be 
disbursed in the reconstruction 
process over a period of 
18 years (2018 to 
2035). Moreover, 
since the previous 
 fiscal plan 
was certified 
in 2021, 
the Commonwealth s 
available resources 
have significantly 
increased principally 
as a 
result of 
two 
 major 
developments: 
(i) 
incremental 
federal 
funding 
for 
health 
care 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
recent 
guidance 
issued 
by 
the 
Centers 
for 
 Medicare and Medicaid 
Services, which increases 
the federal funding 
cap by over 2 
billion per year, 
and (ii) improved 
local revenue 
 collections 
as 
a 
result 
of 
a 
better-than-expected 
recovery, 
increased 
local 
consumption 
and 
economic 
activity 
enabled 
by 
enhanced 
 income support 
programs (e.g., 
incremental funding 
of approximately 
 460 million 
for the 
Nutrition Assistance 
Program). The 
2022 
 Fiscal Plan provides a 
roadmap to take advantage 
of this unique opportunity, 
create an environment of 
fiscal stability, 
and develop the 
 conditions for long-term growth and economic development 
, 
while continuing to underline the need to implement structural reforms 
to 
 maximize the positive impact of federal recovery funds. 
 Debt Restructuring 
 After more than 
four years since 
the Commonwealth 
entered Title 
III, on January 
18, 2022, the 
U.S. District Court 
for the District 
 of Puerto 
Rico (the 
 Court issued 
an order 
to confirm 
the Plan 
of Adjustment 
to restructure 
approximately 35 
billion of 
debt and 
 other claims 
against the 
Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, 
the PBA, 
and the 
ERS; and 
more than 
 50 billion 
of pension 
liabilities. The 
 Plan of Adjustment became effective 
on March 15, 2022, as the Government 
of Puerto Rico completed the exchange 
of more than 33 
 billion 
of 
existing 
bonds 
and 
other 
claims 
into 
approximately 
 7 
billion 
of 
new 
bonds. 
As 
a 
result, 
annual 
debt 
service 
for 
the 
 Commonwealth 
is 
anticipated 
to 
decrease 
from 
a 
maximum 
of 
 3.9 
billion 
prior 
to 
the 
restructuring 
to 
 1.15 
billion 
each 
year. 
In 
 addition, 
the 
Commonwealth 
made 
more 
than 
 10 
billion 
in 
cash 
payments 
to 
various 
creditor 
groups, 
as 
well 
as 
implemented 
the 
 Pension Reserve 
Trust 
provisions created 
in the 
Plan of 
Adjustment. The 
Pension Reserve 
Trust 
is projected 
to be 
funded with 
more 
 than 
 10 
billion 
in 
contributions 
over 
the 
next 
10 
years, 
including 
 1.4 
billion 
that 
were 
contributed 
on 
September 
30, 
2022. 
 Confirmation 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
Plan 
of 
Adjustment 
marks 
a 
major 
milestone 
in 
the 
overall 
debt 
restructuring 
process 
and 
 creates a foundation for Puerto Rico s 
recovery and economic growth. 
 On October 12, 2022, 
the Court issued an order to 
confirm the Puerto Rico Highway 
and Transportation Authority s HTA 
Plan 
 of 
Adjustment 
to 
restructure 
approximately 
 6.4 
billion 
in 
claims. 
On 
December 
6, 
2022, 
the 
HTA 
Plan 
of 
Adjustment 
became 
 effective. The 
transactions therein 
significantly lessen 
HTA s 
debt burden 
by reducing 
HTA s 
funded debt 
by 75 , 
from 6.4 billion 
 to 1.245 
billion senior 
and 359 
million subordinate 
HTA 
toll road-supported 
debt. The 
substantial consummation 
of the 
HTA 
Plan 
 of Adjustment 
represents a 
significant 
achievement 
in advancing 
Puerto Rico s 
public 
policy objective 
to attain 
fiscal responsibility 
 and to 
access the 
capital markets 
and is 
expected to 
enable HTA 
to make 
the necessary 
investments to 
improve and 
maintain Puerto 
 Rico s roads and other transportation 
infrastructure. 
 On February 9, 
2023, the PROMESA 
oversight board 
filed an amended 
proposed Plan of 
Adjustment and Disclosure 
Statement to 
 restructure the 
debt of 
the Puerto 
Rico Electric 
Power Authority PREPA-POA ). 
The PREPA 
-POA proposes 
to cut 
PREPA s 
more 
 than 10 billion of debt and other 
claims by almost half, to approximately 
 5.68 billion. According to the PROMESA 
oversight board, 

108 
 the 
restructured 
debt 
would 
be paid 
by 
a hybrid 
charge 
(the Legacy 
Charge 
consisting 
of 
a 
flat 
connection 
fee 
and 
a 
volumetric 
 charge based 
on the amount 
of PREPA 
customers electricity 
usage that would 
be added to 
the electricity bills. 
The proposed 
Legacy 
 Charge is 
subject to 
approval by 
the Puerto 
Rico Energy 
Bureau, the 
independent energy 
regulator. 
The Court 
will hold 
a hearing 
to 
 consider approval of the Disclosure Statement on February 28, 2023. 
 Other Developments 
 On September 
17, 2022, 
Hurricane Fiona 
made landfall 
on the 
southwestern part 
of Puerto 
Rico with 
winds exceeding 
100 miles 
 per 
hour in 
some 
areas and 
leaving historic 
amounts 
of rain, 
causing 
a complete 
power outage 
in Puerto 
Rico, 
which in 
turn led 
to 
 water service 
interruptions for 
over 778,000 
residents in 
the Island. 
Following the 
passage of 
the hurricane, 
President Biden 
granted 
 the Governor s 
request for 
a declaration of 
a major disaster 
for all 78 
municipalities in 
Puerto Rico, and 
as a result, 
all municipalities 
 have 
access 
to 
FEMA s 
Public 
Assistance 
Programs 
for 
response 
and 
reconstruction 
projects. 
In 
addition, 
the 
local government, 
in 
 collaboration 
with 
the 
PROMESA 
oversight 
board, 
has 
enacted 
numerous 
emergency 
response 
measures 
to 
provide 
immediate 
 funding 
and assistance 
to municipalities 
and 
governmental 
agencies. 
As of 
October 
14, 2022, 
99 of 
both 
Puerto Rico s 
water and 
 electric services had been restored. 
 Notable 
progress 
continues 
to 
be 
made 
as 
part 
of 
the 
ongoing 
efforts 
of 
prioritizing 
the 
restoration, 
improvement, 
and 
 modernization 
of 
Puerto 
Rico s 
infrastructure. 
According 
to 
the 
Central 
Office 
for 
Recovery, 
Reconstruction, 
and 
Resiliency 
 COR3 ), 
progress 
is 
evidenced 
by 
the 
significant 
increase 
in 
permanent 
work 
projects 
that 
have 
already 
started 
executing 
the 
 reconstruction 
efforts 
with FEMA 
obligated 
funding. 
As of 
September 
30, 2022, 
there were 
a total 
of 5,63 
7 
active permanent 
work 
 projects 
reported, 
more 
than 
twice 
the 
comparable 
amount 
reported 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2021, 
of 
2,650 
projects. 
Furthermore, 
on 
 October 
5, 
2022, 
COR3 
announced 
that 
during 
the 
first 
nine 
months 
of 
2022, 
the 
Government 
had 
already 
reached 
its goal 
for 
the 
 entire 
year 
of 
disbursing 
approximately 
 1 
billion 
in 
advances 
and 
reimbursements 
for 
projects 
led 
by 
municipalities, 
government 
 dependencies and non-profit 
organizations, through FEMA s 
Public Assistance program. 
Such progress has been mainly 
driven by the 
 implementation 
of 
the 
Working 
Capital 
Advance WCA 
program 
during 
June 
2022. 
The 
WCA 
program, 
which 
was 
originally 
 made available to municipalities and more recently extended 
to PREPA, 
PRASA and other government agencies, advances 25 of 
the 
 total 
cost 
of 
obligated 
projects 
that 
have 
not 
commenced 
due 
to 
lack 
of 
funding. 
According 
to 
COR3, 
the 
extension 
of 
the 
WCA 
 program to these additional entities is expected to accelerate the pace of disbursements 
going forward. 
 On 
January 
25, 
2023, 
the 
Government 
of 
Puerto 
Rico 
announced 
that 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
Public-Private 
Partnerships 
Authority 
 P3A selected 
Genera PR 
LLC Genera 
to operate 
and maintain PREPA s 
legacy power 
plants pursuant 
to a 10-year 
Operation 
 and Maintenance 
Agreement. Genera 
was selected 
by the 
P3A after 
a competitive 
process that 
began in 
2020. Under 
the agreement, 
 Genera will 
operate, maintain, 
decommission, and 
modernize the 
PREPA-owned 
thermal power 
generation system 
of approximately 
 3,600 MW 
after a 
mobilization period. 
In this 
role, Genera 
will manage 
the operating 
budget, fuel 
contracts and 
federal funds 
for the 
 generation fleet 
on behalf 
of PREPA. 
Key features 
of Genera s 
proposal selected 
by the 
P3A include 
(i) significant 
cost-savings for 
 the benefit 
of Puerto 
Rico s 
ratepayers through 
fuel management 
and streamlined 
operations, (ii) 
improved reliability 
and efficiency 
 across 
the 
generation 
system 
with 
a 
focus 
on 
distributed 
power 
and 
microgrids, 
(iii) 
retirement 
of 
antiquated 
power 
plants 
while 
 ensuring there is reliable, 
low-cost and cleaner generation 
in load centers to support 
the transition to renewables, 
and (iv) commitment 
 to local 
hiring 
and 
plans to 
recruit, train 
and 
incentivize 
employees. 
Headquartered 
in San 
Juan, 
PR, Genera 
is a 
power 
and 
energy 
 service provider, and an independently 
managed subsidiary of New Fortress Energy (NASDAQ: NFE). 
 On January 26, 2023, FEMA announced that it had recently approved 
approximately 422 million to restore and renovate 37 multi-
 family 
residential 
properties 
belonging 
to 
the 
Public 
Housing 
Administration 
due 
to 
damaged 
caused 
by 
Hurricane 
Mar a. 
These 
 works 
will 
benefit 
over 
5,400 
families 
throughout 
the 
island. 
According 
to 
FEMA, 
the 
funds 
include 
nearly 
 165.3 
million 
for 
 measures that seek to strengthen the facilities, thus mitigating future damage from 
other disasters. 
 The PROMESA 
oversight board, 
in collaboration 
with the 
Government of 
Puerto Rico, 
is currently 
in the 
process of 
developing, 
 submitting, and 
certifying the 2023 
Fiscal Plan for 
the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico (the 
 2023 Fiscal Plan ). 
On January 25, 
2023, 
 the PROMESA 
oversight board 
sent a 
letter to 
the Governor 
of Puerto 
Rico outlining 
a revised 
schedule in 
order to 
allow additional 
 time 
for 
the 
integration 
of 
more 
recent 
information 
regarding 
Puerto 
Rico s 
macroeconomic 
environment, 
federal 
funding, 
and 
 Government revenues and expenditures 
that will underpin the Fiscal Year 
2024 development process 
in the spring of 2023. 
According 
 to the 
letter, 
the PROMESA 
oversight board 
expects to 
certify the 
2023 Fiscal 
Plan on 
or before 
March 16, 
2023. In 
a separate 
letter 
 sent to the Governor on February 16, 
2023, the PROMESA oversight board mentioned 
that the fact that this will be the first 
fiscal plan 
 to be certified in a 
fully post-restructuring environment presents 
a unique opportunity to focus 
the 2023 Fiscal Plan on 
three pillars: (i) 
 entrenching 
a 
legacy 
of 
strong 
fiscal 
management 
to 
prevent 
a 
recurrence 
of 
past 
challenges 
and 
secure 
a 
stable 
base 
for 
future 
 prosperity, 
(ii) establishing 
conditions for 
economic prosperity 
to improve 
the livelihood 
of Puerto 
Rico s 
citizens and 
bolster public 
 finances to facilitate 
key government programs, 
(ii) instilling a culture 
of public-sector excellence 
through targeted actions 
focused on 
 enhancing the foundation for high performance in the public sector.

 Exposure to Puerto Rico Government 
 As of December 
31, 2022, the 
Corporation had 338.9 
million of direct 
exposure to the 
Puerto Rico government, 
its municipalities 
 and 
public 
corporations, 
compared 
to 
 360.1 
million 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2021. 
As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
approximately 
 183.4 
 million of the 
exposure consisted of loans 
and obligations of municipalities 
in Puerto Rico that 
are supported by assigned 
property tax 
 revenues 
and 
for 
which, 
in 
most 
cases, 
the 
good 
faith, 
credit 
and 
unlimited 
taxing 
power 
of 
the 
applicable 
municipality 
have 
been 
 pledged 
to 
their 
repayment, 
and 
 114.0 
million 
of 
loans 
and 
obligations 
which 
are 
supported 
by 
one 
or 
more 
specific 
sources 
of 
 municipal 
revenues. 
Approximately 
72 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
exposure 
to 
Puerto 
Rico 
municipalities 
consisted 
primarily 
of 
senior 
 priority loans 
and obligations concentrated 
in four of 
the largest municipalities 
in Puerto Rico. 
The municipalities are 
required by law 
 to levy 
special property 
taxes in 
such amounts 
as are 
required for 
the payment 
of all 
of their 
respective general 
obligation bonds 
and 
 notes. Furthermore, municipalities are also likely to be affected 
by the negative economic and other effects 
resulting from the COVID-
 19 
pandemic, 
as 
well 
as 
expense, 
revenue, 
or 
cash 
management 
measures 
taken 
to 
address 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
government s 
fiscal 
 problems 
and measures 
included 
in fiscal 
plans 
of other 
government 
entities. In 
addition 
to municipalities, 
the 
total direct 
exposure 
 also 
included 
 10.8 
million 
in 
loans 
to 
an 
affiliate 
of 
PREPA, 
 27.4 
million 
in 
loans 
to 
an 
agency 
of 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
central 
 government, and 
obligations of the 
Puerto Rico government, 
specifically a residential 
pass-through MBS 
issued by the 
PRHFA, at 
an 
 amortized cost 
of 3.3 
million as 
part of 
its available-for-sale 
debt securities 
portfolio (fair 
value of 
 2.2 million 
as of 
December 31, 
 2022).

 In 
addition, 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
had 
 84.7 
million 
in 
exposure 
to 
residential 
mortgage 
loans 
that 
are 
 guaranteed by 
the PRHFA, 
a governmental instrumentality 
that has been 
designated as a 
covered entity under 
PROMESA (December 
 31, 
2021 
 
 92.8 
million). 
Residential 
mortgage 
loans 
guaranteed 
by 
the 
PRHFA 
are 
secured 
by 
the 
underlying 
properties 
and 
the 
 guarantees serve 
to cover shortfalls 
in collateral in 
the event of 
a borrower default. 
The Puerto Rico 
government guarantees up 
to 75 
 million 
of 
the 
principal 
for 
all 
loans 
under 
the 
mortgage 
loan 
insurance 
program. 
According 
to 
the 
most 
recently 
released 
audited 
 financial 
statements 
of 
the 
PRHFA, 
as 
of 
June 
30, 
2021, 
the 
PRHFA s 
mortgage 
loans 
insurance 
program 
covered 
loans 
in 
an 
 aggregate 
amount 
of 
approximately 
 473 
million. 
The 
regulations 
adopted 
by 
the 
PRHFA 
require 
the 
establishment 
of 
adequate 
 reserves to 
guarantee 
the solvency 
of the 
mortgage loans 
insurance program. 
As of 
June 30, 
2021, the 
most recent 
date as 
of which 
 information is available, the PRHFA 
had a liability of approximately 5 million as an estimate of the 
losses inherent in the portfolio. 
 As of December 
31, 2022, the 
Corporation had 
 2.3 billion of 
public sector deposits 
in Puerto Rico, 
compared to 2.7 
billion as of 
 December 
31, 
2021. 
Approximately 
24 
of 
the 
public 
sector 
deposits 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2022 
was 
from 
municipalities 
and 
 municipal agencies 
in Puerto 
Rico and 
76 was 
from the 
public corporation, 
the Puerto 
Rico central 
government 
and agencies, 
and 
 U.S. federal government agencies in Puerto Rico. 
 Exposure to USVI Government 
 The Corporation has operations in the USVI and has credit exposure 
to USVI government entities. 
 For 
many 
years, 
the 
USVI 
has 
been 
experiencing 
a 
number 
of 
fiscal 
and 
economic 
challenges 
that 
have 
deteriorated 
the 
overall 
 financial 
and 
economic 
conditions 
in 
the 
area. 
On 
March 
4, 
2022, 
the 
United 
States 
Bureau 
of 
Economic 
Analysis 
(the 
 BEA 
 released 
its 
estimates 
of 
gross 
domestic 
product GDP 
for 
2020. 
According 
to 
the 
BEA, 
the 
USVI s 
real 
GDP 
decreased 
2.2 . 
 Also, the 
BEA revised 
its previously 
published 
real GDP 
growth estimate 
for 
2019 from 
2.2 
to 2.8 . 
According 
to the 
BEA, the 
 decline in real 
GDP for 2020 
reflected decreases 
in exports 
of services, private 
fixed investment, 
personal consumption 
expenditures, 
 and 
government 
spending 
primarily 
as a 
result 
of the 
effects 
of 
the COVID-19 
pandemic. 
These decreases 
were partly 
offset 
by an 
 increase 
in 
private 
inventory investment, 
reflecting 
an increase 
in 
crude 
oil 
and 
other 
petroleum 
products 
imported 
and 
store 
in 
the 
 islands. In 
addition, there 
were reductions 
in imports 
of goods 
including 
consumer goods 
and 
equipment, and 
in import 
of services. 
 According 
to the 
BEA, expenditures 
funded by 
the various 
federal grants 
and transfer 
payments are 
reflected in 
the GDP 
estimates; 
 however, 
the full 
effects 
of the 
pandemic 
cannot be 
quantified in 
the GDP 
statistics for 
the USVI 
because the 
impacts are 
generally 
 embedded in source data and cannot be separately identified. 

 Nonetheless, 
over 
the 
past 
two 
years, 
the 
USVI 
has 
been 
recovering 
from 
the 
adverse 
impact 
caused 
by 
COVID-19 
and 
has 
 continued to make progress 
on its rebuilding efforts 
related to Hurricanes Irma 
and Maria in 2017. 
According to data published 
by the 
 government, 
over 
 1.4 
billion 
in 
disaster 
recovery 
funds 
were 
disbursed 
during 
2021 
and 
2022, 
up 22 
from 
the 
preceding 
2-year 
 period. On the fiscal front, revenues have trended positively 
and the USVI Government successfully completed the 
restructuring 
of the 
 government employee 
retirement system. Although 
no official 
GDP data has 
been released 
for 2021 
and/or 2022, the 
aforementioned 
 developments, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
positive 
trend 
reflected 
by 
key 
economic 
indicators 
such 
as 
visitor 
arrivals, 
non-farm 
payrolls 
and 
 unemployment rate potentially indicate that the territory has experienced 
an overall economic recovery since 2020. 

PROMESA 
does 
not 
apply 
to the 
USVI 
and, 
as such, 
there 
is currently 
no federal 
legislation 
permitting 
the restructuring 
of 
the 
 debts of 
the USVI 
and 
its public 
corporations 
and instrumentalities. 
To 
the extent 
that the 
fiscal condition 
of the 
USVI government 
 continues to 
deteriorate, the 
U.S. Congress 
or the government 
of the 
USVI may enact 
legislation allowing 
for the restructuring 
of the 
 financial 
obligations 
of 
the 
USVI 
government 
entities 
or 
imposing 
a 
stay 
on 
creditor 
remedies, 
including 
by 
making 
PROMESA 
 applicable to the USVI. 

 As of December 31, 2022, 
the Corporation had 38.0 million 
in loans to USVI public corporations, 
compared to 39.2 million as of 
 December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, all loans were currently performing 
and up to date on principal and interest payments.

 BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
 The Corporation 
has included 
in this 
Form 10-K 
the following 
financial measures 
that are 
not recognized 
under GAAP, 
which are 
 referred to as non-GAAP financial measures: 

 1.
 Net 
interest 
income, 
interest 
rate 
spread, 
and 
net 
interest 
margin 
excluding 
the 
changes 
in 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
derivative 
 instruments 
and 
on 
a 
tax-equivalent 
basis 
are 
reported 
in 
order 
to 
provide 
to 
investors 
additional 
information 
about 
the 
 Corporation s 
net 
interest 
income 
that 
management 
uses 
and 
believes 
should 
facilitate comparability and 
analysis 
of 
the 
 periods presented. 
The changes in the 
fair value of 
derivative instruments have 
no effect on 
interest due or 
interest earned on 
 interest-bearing 
liabilities 
or 
interest-earning 
assets, 
respectively. 
The 
tax-equivalent 
adjustment 
to 
net 
interest 
income 
 recognizes 
the income 
tax savings 
when comparing 
taxable and 
tax-exempt assets 
and assumes 
a marginal 
income tax 
rate. 
 Income 
from tax-exempt 
earning assets 
is increased 
by an 
amount equivalent 
to the 
taxes that 
would have 
been paid 
if this 
 income 
had 
been 
taxable 
at 
statutory 
rates. 
Management 
believes 
that 
it 
is 
a 
standard 
practice 
in 
the 
banking 
industry 
to 
 present net 
interest income, 
interest rate spread, 
and net 
interest margin 
on a fully 
tax-equivalent basis. 
This adjustment 
puts 
 all earning assets, most notably 
tax-exempt securities and tax-exempt 
loans, on a common basis that 
facilitates comparison of 
 results to 
the results 
of peers. 
See Results 
of Operati 
ons - 
Net Interest 
Income 
above for 
the table 
that reconciles 
the net 
 interest 
income 
calculated 
and 
presented 
in 
accordance 
with 
GAAP 
with 
the 
non-GAAP 
financial 
measure 
 net 
interest 
 income 
on 
a 
tax-equivalent 
basis 
and 
excluding 
valuations. 
The 
table 
also 
reconciles 
net 
interest 
spread 
and 
margin 
 calculated and 
presented in 
accordance with 
GAAP with 
the non-GAAP 
financial measures 
 net interest 
spread and 
margin 
 on a tax-equivalent basis and excluding valuations. 
 2.
 The 
tangible 
common 
equity 
ratio 
and 
tangible 
book 
value 
per 
common 
share 
are 
non-GAAP 
financial 
measures 
that 
 management believes 
are generally 
used by 
the financial 
community to 
evaluate capital 
adequacy. 
Tangible 
common equity 
 is total 
common equity 
less goodwill 
and other 
intangibles. Similarly, 
tangible assets 
are total 
assets less 
goodwill and 
other 
 intangibles. Management and many stock analysts use the 
tangible common equity ratio and tangible 
book value per common 
 share in conjunction 
with more traditional 
bank capital ratios 
to compare 
the capital adequacy 
of banking organizations 
with 
 significant 
amounts 
of 
goodwill 
or 
other 
intangible 
assets, 
typically 
stemming 
from 
the 
use 
of 
the 
purchase 
method 
of 
 accounting for 
mergers 
and acquisitions. 
Accordingly, 
the Corporation 
believes that 
disclosures of 
these financial 
measures 
 may be useful to investors. Neither tangible 
common equity nor tangible assets, or the related 
measures, should be considered 
 in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders equity, 
total assets, or any other measure calculated in accordance 
with GAAP. 
 Moreover, 
the manner in 
which the Corporation 
calculates its tangible 
common equity, 
tangible assets, and 
any other related 
 measures may differ 
from that of other 
companies reporting measures 
with similar names. See 
 Risk Management 
Capital 
 above for a reconciliation of the Corporation s 
tangible common equity and tangible assets.

 To 
supplement 
the 
Corporation s 
financial 
statements 
presented 
in 
accordance 
with 
GAAP,

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED 
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 Stockholders and the Board of Directors 
 
of First BanCorp. 
 San Juan, Puerto Rico 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control 
over Financial Reporting 
 We 
have 
audited 
the 
accompanying 
consolidated 
statements 
of 
financial 
condition 
of 
First 
BanCorp. 
(the 
"Company") 
as 
of 
 December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated 
statements of income, comprehensive (loss) income, cash flows, and changes 
in 
 stockholders 
equity 
for 
each 
of 
the 
years 
in 
the 
three-year 
period 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022, 
and 
the 
related 
notes 
(collectively 
 referred 
to 
as 
the 
"financial 
statements"). 
We 
also 
have 
audited 
the 
Company s 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
as 
of 
 December 
31, 
2022, 
based 
on 
criteria 
established 
in 
Internal 
Control 
 
Integrated 
Framework: 
(2013) 
issued 
by 
the 
Committee 
of 
 Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, 
the financial statements 
referred to above 
present fairly, 
in all material respects, 
the financial position 
of the Company 
 as of 
December 31, 
2022 and 
2021, and 
the results 
of its 
operations and 
its cash 
flows for 
each of 
the years 
in the 
three-year period 
 ended December 
31, 2022 
in conformity 
with accounting 
principles generally 
accepted in 
the United 
States of 
America. 
Also in 
our 
 opinion, the Company maintained, 
in all material respects, effective 
internal control over financial 
reporting as of December 
31, 2022, 
 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework: 
(2013) issued by COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The 
Company s 
management 
is 
responsible 
for 
these 
financial 
statements, 
for 
maintaining 
effective 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
 reporting, 
and 
for 
its 
assessment 
of 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting, 
included 
in 
the 
accompanying 
 Management s 
Report 
on Internal 
Control 
over 
Financial 
Reporting. 
Our responsibility 
is to 
express an 
opinion 
on the 
Company s 
 financial statements 
and an 
opinion on 
the Company s 
internal control 
over financial 
reporting based 
on our 
audits. 
We 
are a 
public 
 accounting firm 
registered with 
the Public 
Company Accounting 
Oversight Board 
(United States) 
("PCAOB") and 
are required 
to be 
 independent with 
respect to 
the Company 
in accordance 
with the 
U.S. federal 
securities laws and 
the applicable 
rules and regulations 
 of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We conducted 
our audits in accordance with the 
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require 
that we plan and perform the audits 
 to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether 
the financial statements are 
free of material misstatement, 
whether due to error 
or fraud, 
 and whether effective internal control 
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

 Our 
audits 
of 
the 
financial 
statements 
included 
performing 
procedures 
to 
assess 
the 
risks 
of 
material 
misstatement 
of 
the 
financial 
 statements, whether due to error or fraud, 
and performing procedures that respond to 
those risks. Such procedures included examining, 
 on 
a 
test basis, 
evidence 
regarding 
the 
amounts 
and 
disclosures 
in 
the 
financial 
statements. 
Our 
audits 
also 
included 
evaluating 
the 
 accounting 
principles 
used 
and 
significant 
estimates 
made 
by 
management, 
as 
well 
as 
evaluating 
the 
overall 
presentation 
of 
the 
 financial statements. Our audit 
of internal control over 
financial reporting included obtaining 
an understanding of internal 
control over 
 financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness 
 of internal control 
based on the 
assessed risk. 
Our audits also 
included performing 
such other procedures 
as we considered 
necessary 
 in the circumstances. 
We believe that our audits 
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s 
internal control over financial reporting is a 
process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of 
 financial reporting and 
the preparation of 
financial statements for 
external purposes in 
accordance with generally 
accepted accounting 
 principles. 
A 
company s 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
includes 
those 
policies 
and 
procedures 
that 
(1) 
pertain 
to 
the 
 maintenance 
of 
records 
that, 
in 
reasonable 
detail, 
accurately 
and 
fairly 
reflect 
the 
transactions 
and 
dispositions 
of 
the 
assets 
of 
the 
 company; (2) provide 
reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded 
as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial 
statements in 
 accordance with 
generally accepted 
accounting principles, 
and that 
receipts and 
expenditures of 
the company 
are being 
made only 
in 
 accordance 
with 
authorizations 
of 
management 
and 
directors 
of 
the 
company; 
and 
(3) 
provide 
reasonable 
assurance 
regarding 
 prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company s 
assets that could have a material effect 
 on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over 
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. 
Also, projections 
 of any evaluation 
of effectiveness to 
future periods are 
subject to the 
risk that controls 
may become inadequate 
because of changes 
in 
 conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate.

 Critical Audit Matter
 The 
critical 
audit 
matter 
communicated 
below 
is a 
matter 
arising 
from 
the 
current 
period 
audit 
of 
the 
financial 
statements 
that 
was 
 communicated or required 
to be communicated 
to the audit 
committee and that: 
(1) relates to accounts 
or disclosures that 
are material 
 to the financial 
statements and (2) 
involved our especially 
challenging, subjective, 
or complex judgments. 
The communication of 
the 
 critical 
audit 
matter 
does 
not 
alter 
in 
any 
way 
our 
opinion 
on 
the 
financial 
statements, 
taken 
as 
a 
whole, 
and 
we 
are 
not, 
by 
 communicating 
the 
critical 
audit 
matter 
below, 
providing 
a 
separate 
opinion 
on 
the 
critical 
audit 
matter 
or 
on 
the 
accounts 
or 
 disclosures to which it relates. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses Model and Forecast of Macroeconomic Variables 
 As described 
in Notes 
1 and 
5 to 
the financial 
statements, the 
allowance for 
credit losses ACL for 
loans and 
finance leases 
is an 
 accounting 
estimate 
of 
expected 
credit 
losses 
over 
the 
contractual 
life 
of 
financial 
assets 
carried 
at 
amortized 
cost 
and 
off-balance-
 sheet credit exposures. 
 The calculation 
of the 
ACL for 
loans and 
finance leases 
is primarily 
measured based 
on a 
probability 
of default 
/ loss 
given 
default 
 modeled approach. The 
estimate of the 
probability of default and 
loss given default 
assumptions uses economic 
forecasts and relevant 
 current 
and 
forward-looking 
macroeconomic 
variables, 
such 
as: 
unemployment 
rate; 
housing 
and 
real 
estate 
price 
indices; 
interest 
 rates; market 
risk factors; 
and gross 
domestic 
product, and 
considers 
conditions 
throughout Puerto 
Rico, the 
Virgin 
Islands, 
and the 
 State of Florida. 
A significant amount 
of judgment is 
required to 
assess the reasonableness 
of the selection 
of economic forecasts 
and 
 macroeconomic variables. Changes to these assumptions could have 
a material effect on the Company s 
financial results. 
 The 
model 
and 
the 
current 
and 
forward-looking 
macroeconomic 
variables 
used 
contribute 
significantly 
to 
the 
determination 
of 
the 
 ACL for 
loans and 
finance leases. 
We 
identified the 
assessment of 
the model 
design and 
construction and 
the assessment 
of relevant 
 macroeconomic 
variables 
as a 
critical audit 
matter as 
the impact 
of these 
judgments 
represents a 
significant 
portion 
of the 
ACL for 
 loans 
and 
finance 
leases 
and 
because 
management s 
estimate 
required 
especially 
subjective 
auditor 
judgment 
and 
significant 
audit 
 effort, including the need for specialized skill. 

 The primary procedures we performed to address these critical audit matters included: 
 
 Testing 
the effectiveness 
of controls 
over the 
evaluation of 
the selection 
of economic 
forecasts and 
the current 
and forward-
 looking macroeconomic variables, including controls addressing: 
 o
 Management s review and 
approval of the economic forecasts and macroeconomic variables. 
 o
 Management s 
review 
of 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
the 
results 
of 
the 
selection 
of 
economic 
forecasts 
and 
 macroeconomic variables used in the calculation. 
 
 Substantively 
testing 
management s 
process, 
including 
evaluating 
their 
judgments 
and 
assumptions, 
for 
economic 
forecast 
 selection and macroeconomic variables, which included: 
 o
 Evaluation of reasonableness of economic forecasts selection. 
 o
 Evaluation 
of 
the 
completeness 
and 
accuracy 
of 
data 
inputs 
used 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
the 
adjustments 
relating 
to 
 macroeconomic variables. 
 o
 Evaluation, 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
professionals 
with 
specialized 
skill 
and 
knowledge, 
of 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
 management s 
judgments related 
to the 
economic forecast 
and macroeconomic 
variables used 
in the 
determination 
 of 
the 
ACL 
for 
loans. 
Among 
other 
procedures, 
our 
evaluation 
considered 
evidence 
from 
internal 
and 
external 
 sources, loan portfolio performance trends and whether such assumptions were 
applied consistently period to period. 
 o
 Analytical evaluation of the variables period to period for directional consistency 
and testing for reasonableness.

 Management s Report on Internal Control 
over Financial Reporting 
 To the Stockholders 
and Board of Directors of First BanCorp.: 
 First BanCorp. s 
(the Corporation 
internal control 
over financial 
reporting is 
a process 
designed 
and effected 
by those 
charged 
 with 
governance, 
management, 
and 
other 
personnel, 
to 
provide 
reasonable 
assurance 
regarding 
the 
reliability 
of 
financial 
reporting 
 and the preparation of reliable 
financial statements in accordance 
with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of 
 America GAAP ). 
The 
Corporation s 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
includes 
those 
policies 
and 
procedures 
that: 
 (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records 
that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect 
the transactions and dispositions 
of the 
 assets 
of 
the 
Corporation; 
(2) provide 
reasonable 
assurance 
that 
transactions 
are 
recorded 
as 
necessary 
to 
permit 
the 
preparation 
of 
 financial 
statements 
in 
accordance 
with 
GAAP, 
and 
that 
receipts 
and 
expenditures 
of 
the 
Corporation 
are 
being 
made 
only 
in 
 accordance 
with 
authorizations 
of 
management 
and 
directors 
of 
the 
Corporation; 
and 
(3) provide 
reasonable 
assurance 
regarding 
 prevention, 
or timely 
detection and 
correction 
of unauthorized 
acquisition, 
use, or 
disposition of 
the Corporation s 
assets that 
could 
 have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of 
its inherent 
limitations, internal 
control over 
financial reporting 
may not 
prevent, or 
detect and 
correct misstatements. 
 Also, 
projections 
of 
any 
evaluation 
of 
effectiveness 
to 
future 
periods 
are 
subject 
to 
the 
risk 
that 
controls 
may 
become 
inadequate 
 because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies 
and procedures may deteriorate. 
 Management 
is 
responsible 
for 
establishing 
and 
maintaining 
effective 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting. 
Management 
 assessed 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
as 
of 
December 31, 
2022, 
based 
on 
the 
 framework

Sponsoring 
Organizations 
of 
the 
Treadway 
Commission

assessment, 
management 
concluded 
that, 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation s 
 internal control over financial reporting is effective 
based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).

days 
past 
due 
for 
interest 
and 
principal, 
except 
for 
residential 
 mortgage loans insured or guaranteed 
by the Federal Housing Administration 
(the FHA ), the Veterans 
Administration (the VA 
or 
 the 
PRHFA, 
and 
credit 
card 
loans. 
It 
is 
the 
Corporation s 
policy 
to 
report 
delinquent 
mortgage 
loans 
insured 
by 
the 
FHA, 
or 
 guaranteed by 
the VA 
or the 
PRHFA, 
as loans 
past due 

days and 
still accruing 
as opposed 
to nonaccrual 
loans since 
the principal 
 repayment is insured or guaranteed. However, 
the Corporation discontinues the recognition of 
income relating to FHA/VA 
loans when 
 such 
loans 
are 
over 

months 
delinquent, 
taking 
into 
consideration 
the 
FHA 
interest 
curtailment 
process, 
and 
relating 
to 
PRHFA 
 loans when 
such loans are 
over 

days delinquent. 
Credit card loans 
continue to 
accrue finance charges 
and fees until 
charged off 
at 

days. Loans 
generally may 
be placed 
on nonaccrual 
status prior 
to when 
required by 
the policies 
described above 
when the 
full 
 and 
timely 
collection 
of 
interest 
or 
principal 
becomes 
uncertain 
(generally 
based 
on 
an 
assessment 
of 
the 
borrower s 
financial 
 condition 
and 
the 
adequacy 
of 
collateral, 
if 
any). 
When 
a 
loan 
is 
placed 
on 
nonaccrual 
status, 
any 
accrued 
but 
uncollected 
interest 
 income 
is 
reversed 
and 
charged 
against 
interest 
income 
and 
amortization 
of 
any 
net 
deferred 
fees 
is 
suspended. 
Interest 
income 
on 
 nonaccrual 
loans 
is 
recognized 
only 
to 
the 
extent 
it 
is 
received 
in 
cash. 
However, 
when 
there 
is 
doubt 
regarding 
the 
ultimate 
 collectability of loan 
principal, all cash 
thereafter received is 
applied to reduce 
the carrying value of 
such loans i.e.
 , the cost recovery 
 method). Under the cost-recovery 
method, interest income is not 
recognized until the loan balance has 
been collected in full, including 
 the charged-off 
portion. Generally, 
the Corporation returns 
a loan to 
accrual status when 
all delinquent interest 
and principal becomes 
 current under 
the terms of 
the loan agreement, 
or after a 
sustained period of 
repayment performance ) and the 
loan is well 
 secured and in 
the process of collection, 
and full repayment 
of the remaining 
contractual principal and 
interest is expected. 
Loans that 
 are 
past 
due 
30 
days 
or 
more 
as 
to 
principal 
or 
interest 
are 
considered 
delinquent, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
residential 
mortgage, 
 commercial mortgage, 
and construction loans, 
which are considered 
past due when 
the borrower is 
in arrears on 
two or more 
monthly 
 payments. 
The 
Corporation 
has 
elected 
not 
to 
measure 
an 
ACL 
on 
accrued 
interest 
related 
to 
loans 
held 
for 
investment, 
as 
 uncollectible accrued interest receivables 
are written off on a timely manner. 
 Loans Acquired 
 
 Loans acquired through a purchase 
or a business combination 
are recorded at their fair 
value as of the acquisition 
 date. 
The 
Corporation 
performs 
an 
assessment 
of 
acquired 
loans 
to 
first 
determine 
if 
such 
loans 
have 
experienced 
a 
more 
than 
 insignificant deterioration 
in credit 
quality since 
their origination 
and thus 
should be 
classified and 
accounted for 
as purchased 
credit 
 deteriorated PCD 
loans. 
For 
loans 
that 
have 
not 
experienced 
a 
more 
than 
insignificant 
deterioration 
in 
credit 
quality 
since 
 origination, 
referred 
to as 
non-PCD loans, 
the 
Corporation 
records 
such loans 
at fair 
value, 
with any 
resulting 
discount or 
premium 
 accreted 
or 
amortized 
into 
interest 
income 
over 
the 
remaining 
life 
of 
the 
loan 
using 
the 
interest 
method. 
Additionally, 
upon 
the 
 purchase or acquisition of non-PCD loans, 
the Corporation measures and records 
an ACL based on the Corporation s 
methodology for 
 determining 
the 
ACL. 
The 
ACL for 
non-PCD 
loans 
is 
recorded 
through 
a 
charge 
to 
the 
provision 
for 
credit 
losses 
in 
the 
period 
in 
 which the loans are purchased or acquired. 
 Acquired loans that are classified 
as PCD are recognized at fair 
value, which includes any premiums 
or discounts resulting from 
the 
 difference between 
the initial amortized 
cost basis and 
the par value. 
Premiums and non-credit 
loss related discounts 
are amortized or 
 accreted into interest 
income over the 
remaining life of 
the loan using 
the interest method. 
Unlike non-PCD loans, 
the initial ACL 
for 
 PCD loans is established through an adjustment 
to the acquired loan balance and not through a charge 
to the provision for credit losses 
 in the period in which the loans are acquired. At acquisition, the ACL for 
PCD loans, which represents the fair value credit discount, is 
 determined 
using 
a 
discounted 
cash 
flow 
method 
that 
considers 
the 
PDs 
and 
LGDs 
used 
in 
the 
Corporation s 
ACL 
methodology. 
 Characteristics 
of 
PCD 
loans 
include 
the 
following: 
delinquency, 
payment 
history 
since 
origination, 
credit 
scores 
migration 
and/or 
 other 
factors 
the Corporation 
may 
become 
aware of 
through its 
initial analysis 
of acquired 
loans that 
may 
indicate 
there has 
been 
a 
 more than 
insignificant deterioration 
in credit 
quality since 
a loan s 
origination. In 
connection with 
the Banco 
Santander Puerto 
Rico 
 BSPR 
acquisition 
on 
September 
1, 
2020, 
the 
Corporation 
acquired 
PCD 
loans 
with 
an 
aggregate 
fair 
value 
at 
acquisition 
of 
 approximately 

million, and recorded 
an initial ACL 
of approximately 

million, which was added 
to the amortized 
cost of 
 the loans. 

 Subsequent 
to 
acquisition, 
the 
ACL 
for 
both 
non-PCD 
and 
PCD 
loans 
is 
determined 
pursuant 
to 
the 
Corporation s 
ACL 
 methodology in the same manner as all other loans. 
 For PCD loans 
that prior to 
the adoption of 
ASC 326 were 
classified as purchased 
credit impaired PCI 
loans and accounted 
for 
 under 
the 
FASB 
Accounting 
Standards 
Codification 
(the 
 Codification 
or 
 ASC 
Subtopic 
310-30, 
 Accounting 
for 
Purchased 
 Loans Acquired 
with Deteriorated 
Credit Quality 
(ASC Subtopic 
310-30), the 
Corporation adopted 
ASC 326 
using the 
prospective 
 transition approach. 
As allowed 
by ASC 
326, the 
Corporation elected 
to maintain 
pools of 
loans accounted 
for under 
ASC Subtopic 
 310-30 as units 
of accounts, 
conceptually treating 
each pool as 
a single 
asset. As of 
December 31, 
2022, such 
PCD loans consisted 
 of 

million of residential mortgage 
loans and 

million of commercial 
mortgage loans acquired by 
the Corporation as part 
of 
 acquisitions 
completed 
prior 
to 
2020. 
These 
previous 
transactions 
include 
a 
transaction 
completed 
on 
February 
27, 
2015, 
in 
which 
 FirstBank 
acquired 
ten 
Puerto 
Rico 
branches 
of 
Doral 
Bank, 
acquired 
certain 
assets, 
including 
PCD 
loans, 
and 
assumed 
deposits, 
 through an alliance with 
Banco Popular of Puerto 
Rico, which was the successful 
lead bidder with the 
FDIC on the failed Doral 
Bank, 
 as well as other 
co-bidders, and the 
acquisition from Doral 
Financial in the first 
quarter of 2014 
of all of its 
rights, title and 
interest in 
 first 
and 
second 
residential 
mortgage 
loans 
in 
full 
satisfaction 
of 
secured 
borrowings 
owed 
by 
such

days or more past due and secured by 
 residential real estate. 
Moreover, since 
the ACL of auto 
loans and finance 
leases is calculated 
using either a 
PD/LGD model or 
a risk-
 adjusted 
discounted 
cash 
flow 
method 
for 
loans 
modified 
or 
reasonably 
expected 
to 
be 
modified 
in 
a 
TDR 
and 
performing 
in 
 accordance 
with 
restructured 
terms, 
these 
loans 
are 
not 
considered 
collateral 
dependent. 
The 
ACL 
of 
collateral 
dependent 
loans 
is 
 based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for undiscounted 
estimated costs to sell. 
 Collateral 
dependent 
loans 
in 
the 
construction, 
commercial 
mortgage, 
and 
commercial 
and 
industrial C I 
loan 
portfolios 
are 
 written 
down 
to 
their 
net 
realizable 
value 
(fair 
value 
of 
collateral, 
less 
estimated 
costs 
to 
sell) 
when 
loans 
are 
considered 
to 
be 
 uncollectible and 
have balances 
of 

million or 
more. Within 
the consumer 
loan portfolio,
 closed-end consumer 
loans are 
charged 
 off when 
payments are 

days in 
arrears. Open-end 
(revolving credit) 
consumer loans, 
including credit 
card loans, 
are charged 
off 
 when 
payments 
are 

days 
in 
arrears. 
Residential 
mortgage 
loans 
that 
are 

days 
delinquent 
are 
reviewed 
and 
charged-off, 
as 
 needed, to 
the fair 
value of 
the underlying 
collateral less 
cost to 
sell. Generally, 
all loans 
may be 
charged off 
or written 
down to 
the 
 fair 
value 
of 
the 
collateral 
prior 
to 
the 
application 
of 
the 
policies 
described 
above 
if 
a 
loss-confirming 
event 
has 
occurred. 
Loss-
 confirming 
events 
include, 
but 
are 
not 
limited 
to, 
bankruptcy 
(unsecured), 
continued 
delinquency, 
or 
receipt 
of 
an 
asset 
valuation 
 indicating a collateral deficiency when the asset is the sole source of repayment.

and 
a 
reversion 
period 
of up 
to 
 
 , 
 utilizing a 
straight-line approach 
and reverting 
back to 
the historical 
macroeconomic 
mean. For 
the Florida 
region, the 
methodology 
 considers 
a 
reasonable 
and 
supportable 
forecast 
period 
and 
an 
implicit 
reversion 
towards 
the 
historical 
trend 
that 
varies 
for 
each 
 macroeconomic variable. 
After the reversion 
period, a 
historical loss 
forecast period 
covering the 
remaining contractual 
life, adjusted 
 for prepayments, 
is used 
based on 
the changes 
in key 
historical economic 
variables during 
representative historical 
expansionary and 
 recessionary periods. 
 Furthermore, the 
Corporation periodically 
considers the 
need for 
qualitative adjustments 
to the 
ACL. Qualitative 
adjustments may 
 be related 
to and include, 
but not be 
limited to factors 
such as: (i) 
management s 
assessment of 
economic forecasts used 
in the 
model 
 and how 
those forecasts 
align with 
management s 
overall evaluation 
of current 
and expected 
economic conditions, 
including, but 
not 
 limited to, expectations 
about interest rate, 
inflation, and 
real estate price 
levels, as well 
as labor 
challenges; (ii) 
organization specific 
 risks such 
as credit 
concentrations, 
collateral 
specific risks, 
nature 
and 
size of 
the portfolio 
and 
external 
factors that 
may 
ultimately 
 impact credit quality, 
and (iii) other 
limitations associated with 
factors such as 
changes in underwriting 
and loan resolution 
strategies, 
 among others. 
 In addition 
to loans previously 
written down 
to their respective 
realizable values, 
the ACL on 
loans that have 
been modified or 
are 
 reasonably 
expected 
to 
be 
modified 
in 
a 
TDR 
and 
that 
have 
balances 
of 

million 
or 
more 
in 
the 
case 
of 
commercial 
and 
 construction 
loans 
(other 
than 
commercial 
mortgage 
and 
construction 
loans, 
in 
which 
the 
ACL 
is 
based 
on 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
the 
 collateral 
at 
the 
reporting 
date, 
adjusted 
for 
undiscounted 
estimated 
costs 
to 
sell) 
is 
generally 
measured 
using 
a 
risk-adjusted 
 discounted cash flow 
method. Under this 
approach, all future 
cash flows (interest 
and principal) for 
each loan are 
adjusted by the 
PDs 
 and LGDs derived from the term 
structure curves and prepayments and 
then discounted at the rate of the 
loan prior to the restructuring 
 (or at the 
effective interest 
rate as of the 
reporting date for 
non-TDRs previously written 
down to their 
respective realizable values)

does not

liabilities 
that 
arise

Operating

 Assessment for Credit Losses 
 Debt securities 
issued by 
U.S. government 
agencies, 
U.S. GSEs, 
and 
the U.S. 
Treasury, 
including 
notes and 
MBS, accounted 
for 
 substantially all of the total available-for 
-sale portfolio as of December 31, 2022, and 
the Corporation expects no credit losses on 
these 
 securities, 
given 
the 
explicit 
and 
implicit 
guarantees 
provided 
by 
the 
U.S. 
federal 
government. 
Because 
the 
decline 
in 
fair 
value 
is 
 attributable to 
changes in 
interest rates, and 
not credit 
quality, 
and because 
the Corporation 
does not have 
the intent to 
sell these U.S. 
 government 
and 
agencies 
debt 
securities 
and 
it 
is 
likely 
that 
it 
will 
not 
be 
required 
to 
sell 
the 
securities 
before 
their 
anticipated 
 recovery, 
the 
Corporation 
does 
not 
consider 
impairments 
on 
these 
securities 
to 
be 
credit 
related 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2022. 
The 
 Corporation s 
credit loss 
assessment was 
concentrated mainly 
on private 
label MBS 
and on 
Puerto Rico 
government debt 
securities, 
 for which credit losses are evaluated on a quarterly basis. 
 The 
Corporation s 
available-for-sale 
MBS 
portfolio 
included 
private 
label 
MBS 
with 
a 
fair 
value 
of 

million, 
which 
had 
 unrealized 
losses of 
approximately 

million as 
of December 
31, 2022, 
of which 

million is 
due to 
credit deterioration 
and is 
 part of the ACL. 

As 
 of December 31, 
2022, the Corporation 
did not have the 
intent to sell these 
securities and determined 
that it is likely 
that it will not 
be 
 required to sell the securities before 
anticipated recovery. 
The Corporation determined the ACL 
for private label MBS based on 
a risk-
 adjusted 
discounted 
cash flow 
methodology 
that considers 
the structure 
and 
terms of 
the instruments. 
The Corporation 
utilized PDs 
 and 
LGDs 
that 
considered, 
among 
other 
things, 
historical 
payment 
performance, 
loan-to-value 
attributes, 
and 
relevant 
current 
and 
 forward-looking 
macroeconomic 
variables, 
such 
as regional 
unemployment 
rates 
and 
the housing 
price 
index. 
Under 
this approach, 
 expected 
cash 
flows 
(interest 
and 
principal) 
were 
discounted 
at 
the 
Treasury 
yield 
curve 
as 
of 
the 
reporting 
date. 
Significant 
 assumptions in the valuation of the private label MBS were as follows:

million, which had an unrealized loss 
 of approximately 

million. Approximately 

million of 
the unrealized 
losses was 
due to 
credit deterioration 
and is 
part of 
the 
 ACL. The underlying 
second mortgage loans 
were originated under 
a program launched by 
the Puerto Rico government 
in 2010. This 
 residential pass-through MBS 
was structured as 
a zero-coupon bond 
for the first ten 
years (up to July 2019). 
The underlying source 
of 
 repayment on this 
residential pass-through 
MBS are second mortgage 
loans in Puerto Rico. 
PRHFA, not 
the Puerto Rico 
government, 
 provides 
a 
guarantee 
in 
the 
event 
of 
default 
and 
subsequent 
foreclosure 
of 
the 
properties 
underlying 
the 
second 
mortgage 
loans. 
 During 
2021, 
the Corporation 
placed 
this instrument 
in 
nonaccrual 
status based 
on 
the delinquency 
status of 
the 
underlying 
second 
 mortgage loans collateral. 
The Corporation determined 
the ACL on this 
instrument based on a 
discounted cash flow methodology 
that 
 considered the 
structure and 
terms of 
the debt 
security. 
The Corporation 
utilized PDs and 
LGDs that 
considered, among 
other things, 
 historical payment 
performance, loan-to-value 
attributes, 
and relevant 
current and 
forward-looking macroeconomic 
variables, such 
as 
 regional 
unemployment 
rates, 
the 
housing 
price 
index, 
and 
expected 
recovery 
from 
the 
PRHFA 
guarantee. 
Under 
this 
approach, 
 expected 
cash 
flows 
(interest 
and 
principal) 
were 
discounted 
at 
the 
Treasury 
yield 
curve 
plus 
a 
spread 
as 
of 
the 
reporting 
date 
and 
 compared 
to 
the 
amortized 
cost. 
In 
the 
event 
that 
the 
second 
mortgage 
loans 
default 
and 
the 
collateral 
is 
insufficient 
to 
satisfy 
the 
 outstanding 
balance 
of 
this 
residential 
pass-through 
MBS, 
PRHFA s 
ability 
to 
honor 
its 
insurance 
will 
depend 
on, 
among 
other 
 factors, 
the financial 
condition of 
PRHFA 
at the 
time 
such obligation 
becomes due 
and payable. 
Further deterioration 
of the 
Puerto 
 Rico 
economy 
or 
fiscal 
health 
of 
the 
PRHFA 
could 
impact 
the 
value 
of 
these 
securities, 
resulting 
in 
additional 
losses 
to 
the 
 Corporation. As 
of December 
31, 2022, 
the Corporation 
did not 
have the 
intent to 
sell this 
security and 
determined that 
it was 
likely 
 that it will not be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery.

 Also, during 
the years ended 
December 31, 
2022, 2021, 
and 2020, the 
Corporation sold approximately 

million, 

million, 
 and 

million, 
respectively, 
of 
performing 
residential 
mortgage 
loans 
to 
FNMA 
and

which 
the 
Corporation 
 recognized a net gain on 
sale of 

million, 

million, and 

million for the years ended 
December 31, 2022, 2021, and 
2020, 
 respectively. 
The 
Corporation s 
continuing 
involvement 
with 
the 
loans 
that 
it 
sells 
consists 
primarily 
of 
servicing 
the 
loans. 
In 
 addition, 
the 
Corporation 
agrees 
to 
repurchase 
loans 
if 
it 
breaches 
any 
of 
the 
representations 
and 
warranties 
included 
in 
the 
sale 
 agreement. These 
representations and 
warranties are consistent 
with the GSEs 
selling and servicing 
guidelines (i.e., 
ensuring that the 
 mortgage was properly underwritten according to established guidelines). 
 For loans 
pooled into 
GNMA MBS, 
the Corporation, 
as servicer, 
holds an 
option to 
repurchase individual 
delinquent loans 
issued 
 on or 
after January 1, 
2003 when certain 
delinquency criteria are 
met. This option 
gives the Corporation 
the unilateral ability, 
but not 
 the obligation, to 
repurchase the delinquent 
loans at par without 
prior authorization from 
GNMA. Since the 
Corporation is considered 
 to 
have 
regained 
effective 
control 
over 
the 
loans, 
it 
is 
required 
to 
recognize 
the 
loans 
and 
a 
corresponding 
repurchase 
liability 
 regardless 
of 
its 
intent 
to 
repurchase 
the 
loans. 
As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022 
and 
2021, 
rebooked 
GNMA 
delinquent 
loans 
that 
were 
 included in the residential mortgage loan portfolio amounted to 

million and 

million, respectively. 

 During 
the 
years 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022, 
2021, 
and 
2020, 
the 
Corporation 
repurchased, 
pursuant 
to 
the 
aforementioned 
 repurchase 
option, 

million, 

million, 
and 

million, 
respectively, 
of 
loans 
previously 
pooled 
into 
GNMA 
MBS. 
The 
 principal 
balance 
of 
these 
loans 
is 
fully 
guaranteed, 
and 
the 
risk 
of 
loss 
related 
to 
the 
repurchased 
loans 
is generally 
limited 
to 
the 
 difference between 
the delinquent interest 
payment advanced to 
GNMA, which is computed 
at the loan s 
interest rate, and 
the interest 
 payments 
reimbursed 
by 
FHA, 
which 
are 
computed 
at 
a 
pre-determined 
debenture 
rate. 
Repurchases 
of 
GNMA 
loans 
allow 
the 
 Corporation, 
among 
other 
things, 
to maintain 
acceptable 
delinquency 
rates 
on outstanding 
GNMA 
pools 
and 
remain as 
a 
seller 
and 
 servicer in good standing with GNMA. 
Historically, losses 
on these repurchases of GNMA 
delinquent loans have been immaterial 
and 
 no provision has been made at the time of sale. 
 Loan 
sales 
to 
FNMA 
and 
FHLMC 
are 
without 
recourse 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
future 
performance 
of 
the 
loans. 
The 
Corporation 
 repurchased at par 
loans previously sold 
to FNMA and 
FHLMC in the 
amount of 

million, 

million, and 

thousand during 
 the years 
ended December 
31, 2022, 
2021, and 
2020, respectively. 
The Corporation s 
risk of 
loss with 
respect to 
these loans 
is also 
 minimal as these repurchased loans are generally performing loans with documentation 
deficiencies. 
 During the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2022, the 
Corporation sold 
a 

million C I 
loan participation 
in the 
Puerto Rico 
region 
 and 
a 

million 
criticized 
C I loan 
participation 
in the 
Florida 
region. 
Also, during 
the year 
ended 
December 31, 
2021, 
a 
 
 million 
construction 
loan 
in 
the Puerto 
Rico 
region 
and 
four criticized 
commercial 
loan participations 
in the 
Florida region 
totaling 

million 
were sold. 
Further, 
during the 
third quarter 
of 2021, 
the Corporation 
sold 

million of 
non-performing 
residential 
 mortgage loans 
and related 
servicing advances 
of 

million. The 
Corporation received 

million, or 
 
 of book 
value before 
 reserves, for 
the 

million of 
non-performing loans 
and related 
servicing advances. 
Approximately 

million of 
reserves had 
 been 
allocated 
to 
the 
loans 
sold. 
The 
transaction 
resulted 
in 
total 
net 
charge-offs 
of 

million 
and 
an 
additional 
loss 
of 
 approximately 

million recorded as charge to the provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 
2021. 
 Finally, the 
Corporation participated in the 
Main Street Lending program 
established by the FED under 
the CARES Act of 2020, 
as 
 amended, 
to 
support 
lending 
to 
small 
and 
medium-sized 
businesses 
that 
were 
in 
sound 
financial 
condition 
before 
the 
onset 
of 
the 
 COVID-19 pandemic. 
Under this 
program, the 
Corporation originated 
loans to 
borrowers meeting 
the terms 
and requirements 
of the 
 program, including requirements 
as to eligibility, 
use of proceeds and 
priority, 
and sold a 95 participation 
interest in these loans 
to a 
 special purpose 
vehicle 
(the Main 
Street SPV 
organized 
by the 
FED to 
purchase the 
participation 
interests from 
eligible lenders, 
 including the 
Corporation. During 
the fourth 
quarter of 
2020, the 
Corporation originated 

loans under 
this program 
totaling 
 
 million in principal amount and sold participation interests totaling 

million to the Main Street SPV. 
 During 
the

million, 
down 
approximately 

million 
from 
 December 31, 
2021. The 
ACL reduction 
for commercial 
and construction 
loans was 

million during 
2022, primarily 
reflecting 
 reduced COVID-19 uncertainties, particularly 
on loans in the hotel, 
transportation and entertainment industries; 
and, to a lesser extent, 
 the effect 
during the 
second half 
of 2022 
of reserve 
releases totaling 

million associated 
with two 
adversely classified 
loans that 
 were paid off 
or sold, partially offset 
by an increase in 
the size of the 
loan portfolio. In addition, 
there was an ACL 
reduction of 
 
 million for residential mortgage loans, 
partially offset by a 

million increase in the ACL for 
consumer loans. The net reduction 
in 
 the ACL for residential mortgage 
loans was primarily driven 
by the overall decrease 
in the size of this portfolio 
and, to a lesser extent, 
 a 
decrease 
in 
qualitative 
adjustments 
due 
to 
improvements 
in 
underlying 
portfolio 
metrics. 
The 
ACL 
increase 
for 
consumer 
loans 
 consisted 
of 
charges 
to 
the 
provision 
of 

million 
recorded 
in 
2022 
mainly 
due 
to 
a 
deterioration 
in 
the 
outlook 
of 
certain 
 macroeconomic variables, such as 
the regional unemployment rate, 
and an increasing trend in delinquency 
and charge-off levels in 
the 
 consumer loan 
portfolios. 
For those 
loans where 
the ACL 
was determined 
based on 
a discounted 
cash flow 
model, the 
change in 
the 
 ACL due to the passage of time is recorded as part of the provision for credit losses. 
 Total 
net 
charge-offs 
decreased 
by 

million 
to 

million, 
when 
compared 
to 
2021. 
The 
variance 
consisted 
of 
a 

million decrease in net 
charge-offs on residential 
mortgage loans, of which 

million was related to charge-offs 
recognized as part 
 of 
the 
bulk 
sale 
of 
nonaccrual 
residential 
mortgage 
loans 
and 
related 
servicing 
advances 
during 
the 
third 
quarter 
of 
2021; 
partially 
 offset 
by 
a 

million increase 
in net 
charge-offs 
on consumer 
and 
finance leases, 
primarily 
in the 
personal loans 
portfolio, 
and 
a

 Investment in Unconsolidated Entity 
 On 
February 
16, 
2011, 
FirstBank 
sold 
an 
asset 
portfolio 
consisting 
of 
performing 
and 
nonaccrual 
construction, 
commercial 
 mortgage, 
and 
C I 
loans 
with 
an 
aggregate 
book

of 
the 
 Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico and majority 
owned by PRLP Ventures 
LLC PRLP ), a company 
created by Goldman, 
Sachs Co. 
 and 
Caribbean 
Property 
Group. 
In 
connection 
with 
the 
sale, 
the 
Corporation 
received 

million 
in 
cash 
and 
a 

interest 
in 
 CPG/GS, 
and 
made 
a 
loan 
in 
the 
amount 
of 

million 
representing 
seller 
financing 
provided 
by 
FirstBank. 
The 
loan 
was 
 refinanced 
and 
consolidated with 
other 
outstanding 
loans of 
CPG/GS in 
the second 
quarter of 
2018 and 
was paid 
in full 
in October 
 2019. 
FirstBank s 
equity 
interest 
in 
CPG/GS 
is 
accounted 
for 
under 
the 
equity 
method. 
FirstBank 
recorded 
a 
loss 
on 
its 
interest 
in 
 CPG/GS in 
2014 that 
reduced to 
zero the 
carrying amount of 
the Bank s 
investment in 
CPG/GS. No 
negative investment 
needs to 
be 
 reported as 
the Bank 
has no 
legal obligation 
or commitment 
to provide 
further financial 
support to 
this entity; 
thus, no 
further losses 
 have been or will be recorded on this investment. 
 CPG/GS 
used 
cash 
proceeds 
of 
the 
aforementioned 
seller-financed 
loan 
to 
cover 
operating 
expenses 
and 
debt 
service 
payments, 
 including those 
related to 
the loan 
that was paid 
off in 
October 2019. 
FirstBank will 
not receive 
any return 
on its equity 
interest until 
 PRLP receives 
an aggregate 
amount equivalent 
to its 
initial investment 
and a 
priority return 
of at 
least 
 
 , which 
has not 
occurred, 
 resulting in FirstBank s 
interest in CPG/GS being 
subordinate to PRLP s 
interest. CPG/GS will 
then begin to 
make payments pro 
rata 
 to 
PRLP 
and 
FirstBank, 

and 
 
 , 
respectively, 
until 
FirstBank

the 
primary 
 beneficiary 
of CPG/GS, 
the Bank 
considered 
applicable guidance 
that requires 
the Bank 
to qualitatively 
assess the 
determination 
of 
 whether 
it is 
the primary 
beneficiary (or 
consolidator) 
of CPG/GS 
based on 
whether it 
has both 
the power 
to direct 
the activities 
of 
 CPG/GS that most significantly 
affect the entity s 
economic performance and the 
obligation to absorb losses 
of, or the right 
to receive 
 benefits from, CPG/GS 
that could potentially 
be significant to 
the VIE. The 
Bank determined that 
it does not 
have the power to 
direct 
 the activities that most significantly 
impact the economic performance 
of CPG/GS as it does not 
have the right to 
manage or influence 
 the loan portfolio, foreclosure proceedings, 
or the construction and sale 
of the property; therefore, the 
Bank concluded that it is not 
the 
 primary beneficiary of CPG/GS.

The Corporation s 
investment policy 
with respect 
to the

to optimize,

risk, the 
total 
 return 
on investment 
of the 
Plan assets 
after inflation, 
within 
a framework 
of prudent 
and reasonable 
portfolio 
risk. The 
investment 
 portfolio 
is 
diversified 
in 
multiple 
asset 
classes 
to 
reduce 
portfolio 
risk,

The

mainly 
driven 
by 
the

increase in

to the 
change in

allowance for its deferred tax assets associated with capital 
losses carry 
 forward 
and 
unrealized

debt 
securities. 
Thus, 
the 
change 
in 
the 
market 
value

The

related to 
the change in

to the Virgin 
Islands jurisdiction, 
and capital 
losses. The remaining 
balance of

Corporation s 
deferred tax asset 
valuation allowance non-attributable 
to FirstBank is 
mainly related to 
NOLs and 
 capital losses 
at the 
holding

The Corporation 
will continue 
to provide 
a valuation 
allowance against 
its deferred 
tax 
 assets in each 
applicable tax 
jurisdiction until 
the need 
for a valuation 
allowance is

The

evaluated on 
a quarterly basis 
 to determine 
if there 
are any 
significant 
events that 
would affect 
the ability 
to utilize 
these deferred

As of

million, 
which 
are 
fully 
valued,

amount, approximately 

million expires in 
year 2023 and 
are not expected 
 to be realized. 
 In 
2017, 
the 
Corporation 
completed 
a 
formal 
ownership 
change 
analysis 
within 
the 
meaning 
of 
Section 
382 
of 
the 
U.S. 
Internal 
 Revenue Code Section 382 
covering a 
comprehensive period 
and concluded 
that an 
ownership 
change had 
occurred during 
such 
 period. 
The 
Section 
382 
limitation 
has 
resulted 
in 
higher 
U.S. 
and 
USVI 
income 
tax 
liabilities 
that 
we 
would 
have 
incurred 
in 
the 
 absence of such limitation. The Corporation has mitigated 
to an extent the adverse effects associated with the 
Section 382 limitation as 
 any 
such 
tax 
paid 
in 
the 
U.S. 
or 
USVI 
can 
be 
creditable 
against 
Puerto 
Rico 
tax 
liabilities 
or 
taken 
as 
a 
deduction 
against 
taxable 
 income. However, 
our ability 
to reduce 
our Puerto 
Rico tax 
liability through 
such a 
credit or 
deduction depends 
on our 
tax profile 
at 
 each annual taxable 
period, which is dependent 
on various factors. 
For 2022, 2021 
and 2020, the Corporation 
incurred current income 
 tax expense 
of approximately 

million, 

million and 

million, respectively, 
related to its 
U.S. operations. 
The limitation 
 did not impact the USVI operations in 2022, 2021 and 2020. 

 On August 
16, 2022, 
the Inflation 
Reduction Act 
of 2022 
(the IRA 
was signed

The IRA 
includes 
 various tax 
provisions, including 
a 1 
excise tax 
on stock 
repurchases, and 
a 15 
corporate alternative 
minimum tax 
that generally 
 applies 
to 
U.S.

with 
average 
adjusted 
financial 
statement 
income 
over 
a 
three-year 
period 
in 
excess 
of 
 1

The 
 legislation did 
not have 
an effect 
on the Corporation s 
effective tax 
rate in 
2022 and 
is not expected 
to have 
a material 
impact on our 
 2023 financial results, including on our annual estimated effective

accounts for uncertain 
tax positions under 
the provisions of 
ASC Topic 
740. The Corporation s 
policy is to 
report 
 interest and penalties related to unrecognized 
tax positions in income tax expense. As 
of December 31, 2022, the Corporation had 

million of 
accrued interest 
and penalties 
related to 
uncertain tax 
positions in 
the amount 
of 

million that 
it acquired 
from BSPR, 
 which, 
if 
recognized, 
would 
decrease 
the 
effective 
income 
tax 
rate 
in 
future 
periods. 
During 
2022, 
a 

million 
benefit 
was 
 recognized as a 
result of the 
expiration of uncertain 
tax positions acquired 
from BSPR. The 
amount of unrecognized 
tax benefits may 
 increase 
or 
decrease 
in 
the 
future 
for 
various 
reasons, 
including 
adding 
amounts 
for 
current 
tax 
year 
positions, 
expiration 
of 
open 
 income 
tax returns 
due 
to the 
statute of 
limitations, 
changes 
in management s 
judgment about 
the level 
of uncertainty, 
the status 
of 
 examinations, 
litigation 
and 
legislative activity, 
and 
the addition 
or elimination 
of uncertain 
tax positions. 
The statute 
of 
limitations 
 under the 2011 
PR code is 
four years after 
a tax return 
is due or 
filed, whichever 
is later; the 
statute of limitations 
for U.S. and 
USVI 
 income 
tax 
purposes 
is 
three 
years 
after 
a 
tax 
return 
is 
due 
or 
filed, 
whichever 
is 
later. 
The 
completion 
of 
an 
audit 
by 
the 
taxing 
 authorities 
or 
the 
expiration 
of 
the 
statute 
of 
limitations 
for 
a 
given 
audit 
period 
could 
result 
in 
an 
adjustment 
to 
the Corporation s 
 liability for 
income taxes. Any 
such adjustment could 
be material to 
the results of 
operations for any 
given quarterly 
or annual period 
 based, in part, upon 
the results of operations 
for the given period. 
For U.S. and USVI 
income tax purposes, all 
tax years subsequent 
to 
 2018 remain open to examination. For Puerto Rico tax purposes, all tax years 
subsequent to 2017 remain open to examination.

 Card and processing 
income 
 Card and processing income includes merchant-related income, and 
credit and debit card fees. 

 For 
merchant-related 
income, 
the 
determination 
of 
income 
recognition 
included 
the 
consideration 
of 
a 
2015 
sale 
of 
merchant 
 contracts 
that 
involved 
sales 
of 
point 
of 
sale POS 
terminals 
and 
a 
marketing 
alliance 
under 
a 
revenue-sharing 
agreement. 
The 
 Corporation 
concluded 
that 
control 
of 
the 
POS 
terminals 
and 
merchant 
contracts 
was 
transferred 
to 
the 
customer 
at 
the 
contract s 
 inception. 
With 
respect 
to 
the 
related 
revenue-sharing 
agreement, 
the 
Corporation 
satisfies 
the 
marketing 
alliance 
performance 
 obligation over 
the life of 
the contract, 
and recognizes the 
associated transaction price 
as the entity 
performs and any 
constraints over 
 the variable consideration are resolved. 
 Credit 
and 
debit 
card 
fees 
primarily 
represent 
revenues 
earned 
from 
interchange 
fees 
and 
ATM 
fees. 
Interchange 
and 
network 
 revenues are earned on credit and 
debit card transactions conducted with 
payment networks. ATM 
fees are primarily earned as a 
result 
 of surcharges 
assessed to 
non-FirstBank customers 
who use 
a FirstBank 
ATM. 
Such fees 
are generally 
recognized concurrently 
with 
 the delivery of services on a daily basis. 
 The 
Corporation 
offers 
products, 
primarily 
credit 
cards, 
that 
offer 
various 
rewards 
to 
reward 
program 
members, 
such 
as 
airline 
 tickets, cash, or 
merchandise, based 
on account 
activity. 
The Corporation 
generally recognizes the 
cost of rewards 
as part of 
business 
 promotion 
expenses when 
the rewards 
are earned 
by the 
customer and, 
at that 
time, records 
the corresponding 
reward liability. 
The 
 Corporation 
determines 
the 
reward 
liability 
based 
on 
points 
earned 
to 
date 
that 
the 
Corporation 
expects 
to 
be 
redeemed 
and 
the 
 average 
cost 
per 
point 
redemption. 
The 
reward 
liability 
is 
reduced 
as 
points 
are 
redeemed. 
In 
estimating 
the 
reward 
liability, 
the 
 Corporation considers historical 
reward redemption behavior, 
the terms of the 
current reward program, 
and the card purchase 
activity. 

 The reward liability 
is sensitive to 
changes in the 
reward redemption 
type and redemption 
rate, which is 
based on the 
expectation that 
 the 
vast 
majority 
of 
all points 
earned 
will eventually 
be 
redeemed. 
The 
reward 
liability, 
which 
is included 
in other 
liabilities in 
the 
 consolidated statements of financial condition, totaled 

million and 

million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Other Fees 

 Other fees primarily 
include revenues generated 
from wire transfers, 
lockboxes, bank 
issuances of checks 
and trust fees 
recognized 
 from 
transfer 
paying 
agent, 
retirement 
plan, 
and 
other 
trustee 
activities. 
Revenues 
are 
recognized 
on 
a 
recurring 
basis 
when 
the 
 services are rendered and are included as part of other non-interest income 
in the consolidated statements of income.

The interest

 As part 
of its 
response to 
the impact 
of COVID-19, 
on March 
31, 2020, 
the federal 
banking agencies 
issued an 
interim final 
rule 
 that 
provided 
the 
option 
to 
temporarily 
delay 
the 
effects 
of 
CECL 
on 
regulatory 
capital 
for 
two 
years, 
followed 
by 
a 
three-year 
 transition period. 
The interim final 
rule provides 
that, at the 
election of 
a qualified 
banking organization, 
the day 1 
impact to retained 
 earnings plus 
 
 of the change 
in the ACL (as 
defined in the final 
rule) from January 1, 
2020 to December 
31, 2021 will be 
delayed 
 for 
two 
years 
and 
phased-in 
at 

per 
year 
beginning 
on 
January 
1, 
2022 
over 
a 
three-year 
period, 
resulting 
in 
a 
total 
transition 
 period 
of 
five 
years. 
Accordingly, 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
capital 
measures 
of 
the 
Corporation 
and 
the 
Bank 
included 

million associated 
with the 
CECL day

 of 
the increase 
in the 
ACL (as 
defined in 
the 
 interim final rule) from January 1, 
2020 to December 31, 2021, 
and 

million remains excluded to be phase-in 
during the next two 
 years. 
The 
federal 
financial 
regulatory 
agencies 
may 
take 
other 
measures 
affecting 
regulatory 
capital 
to 
address 
the 
COVID-19 
 pandemic and related macroeconomic conditions, although the nature 
and impact of such actions cannot be predicted at this time.
