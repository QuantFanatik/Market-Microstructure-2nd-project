Business
of the Cyber Enviro-Tech, Inc.; 

Cyber
Enviro-Tech, Inc is a water science technology company focusing on the remediation of contaminated industrial wastewater with an initial
emphasis on the oil gas industry. We do this by integrating technologies to include cyber, aerospace, satellite, industrial and
AI engineering telemetry. Our water filtration, waste water and alternative energy systems will have neural sensors, controls and networks
- all connected to a cellular device. 

There
are 26 oil wells on our Pilot Oil Field and when funds become available the Company will change over the old pumper jack systems to CETI s
current system. 

The
Company is reviewing its next project where CETI would complete its oil field water filtration system and put the system into use on
the Pilot Oil field in Callahan County. At this time, CETI has not put its water filtration system into place at any location nor has
it entered into any contracts with operators to put the water filtration system into the field. 

Our
focus for the current fiscal year will be on further developing oil production on 479-acre Pilot Oil Field in Callahan County, Texas. 

Sales
Strategy CETI s B2B Sales Strategy will include partnering with individuals and companies who have many years of experience
and developed relationships within their respective aforementioned targeted verticals. Prior knowledge of those specific industry issues,
water filtration needs, history and relationships developed over many years will enable them to shorten the sales cycle for our water
filtration system. As of January 11, 2023 the company has not employed any individuals or companies for its B2B Sales Strategy. 

Market
Demand and Size - CETI s water filtration system can be modified to address many of the water contamination issue that exists
anywhere in the world. The markets envisioned for the CETI water filtration system when funds permit would be both domestic (U.S.) and
global.

Government
Regulation 

We
are subject to government regulations that regulate businesses generally, such as compliance with regulatory requirements of federal,
state, and local agencies and authorities, including regulations concerning workplace safety and labor relations. In addition, our operations
are affected by federal and state laws relating to marketing practices in the oil industry. expansion of operations; a change to or changes
to government regulations; a general economic slowdown; a significant decrease in the price of West Texas Intermediate crude. Any change
in one or more of these factors could reduce our ability to earn and grow revenue in future periods. 

Research
and Development 

We
have invested 20,000 in research and development of perforation procedures as well as approximately 1.6 million in getting our Pilot
Oil Field project (the Alvey Ranch) back into production. Both of these costs have been capitalized. 

Personnel 

As
of December 31, 2022, we have no employees but the Company does have 8 full-time and part-time consultants. .

 125/month and it is rented on a month-to-month basis. The directors and officers of the company generally work from their home offices. 

On
February 10, 2021, CETI entered into an agreement with Danny Hyde, former operator of the Alvey Ranch oil field, to take over as
the operator of record. Danny Hyde died during 2021 and at the end of 2021, we renegotiated with the Estate of Danny Hyde EDH where CETI is to receive a higher percentage of the Working Interest (gross revenue less royalty payments to the landowners). Of the
100 working interest under the December 31, 2021 Agreement between EDH and CETI, EDH receives 18.75 less its share of all operating
costs, taxes, shipping and other expenses associated with the rework, production and delivery of oil from the existing wells on the Alvey
Oil Field. Said 18.75 working interest is to be paid in perpetuity. The remaining 81.25 working interest is to be paid to CETI less
its share of taxes, shipping and other expenses associated with the rework, production and delivery of oil from the existing wells on
the Alvey. For any new wells put into production by CETI, the working interest to EHD, less all its expenses, is 5 . 

In
addition to the working interest payments due EDH from well production, EDH will receive 450,000 to be paid in installments. As of December
31, 2022, the remaining amount owed is 343,500. 

Our
focus for the current fiscal year will be on further locating and developing new working interest opportunities, while continuing to
pursue acquisition of new leases and/or existing oil and gas wells which have potential for production based on the addition of our water
filtration system, if revenues warrant.

Trades
in our common stock may be subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, which imposes requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities
subject to the rule to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by the rule,
broker-dealers must make a special suitability determination for purchasers of the securities and receive the purchaser's written agreement
to the transaction before the sale. 

Our shares are subject to rules applicable to penny
stock which pertain to any equity security with a market price less than 5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than 5.00

document prepared by the SEC, which specifies information about penny stocks and the nature and significance of risks of the penny stock
market. A broker-dealer must also provide the customer with bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer,
and sales person in the transaction, and monthly account statements indicating the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's
account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, the
broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the
purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in
our shares.

deemed pertinent by our Board of Directors.

- all connected to a cellular device. 

There
are 26 oil wells on our Pilot Oil Field and when funds become available the Company will change over the old pumper jack systems to CETI s
current system. 

The
Company is reviewing its next project where CETI would complete its field water filtration system and put the system into use on the
Pilot Oil field in Callahan County. At this time CETI has not put its water filtration system into place at any location nor has it entered
into any contracts with operators to put the water filtration system into the field. 

Our
focus for the current fiscal year will be on further developing oil production on 479-acre Pilot Oil Field in Callahan County, Texas. 

The
Companies industrial wastewater filtration technology will provide the following benefits to its customers including; 

Creative online monitoring
 to ensure and maintain water quality remotely in real time. 

Utilizing
 the leading water filtration processes and technologies to make water usage and consumption safer, 
 more
 efficient and less expensive. 

Combined technologies that
 should produce a water filtration system that can treat water related contamination. 

Through
 high volume water purification technologies, we can recycle contaminated water for reuse to address 
 the
 depleting consumable supply of water. 

Sales
Strategy CETI s B2B Sales Strategy will include partnering with individuals
and companies who have many years of experience and developed relationships within their respective aforementioned targeted verticals.
Prior knowledge of those specific industry issues, water filtration needs, history and relationships developed over many years will enable
them to shorten the sales cycle for our water filtration system. As of March 31, 2023, the Company is in discussion with various individuals
but has not formerly employed any individuals or companies for its B2B Sales Strategy. 

Market
Demand and Size - CETI s water filtration system can be modified to address many of the water contamination issue that
exists anywhere in the world. The markets envisioned for the CETI Water system when funds permit would be both domestic (U.S.) and global.

Revenues . Revenue increased by 496 
due to our sale of oil from our Pilot Project in West Texas. However, this increase is off of a very small base in 2021 14,332) and
overall minimal, as the Company is still doing significant repairs and upgrades to the field. We expect the field to be operating normally
by the second quarter of 2023. 

Cost of Sales . Increase by 545 due
to increased volume during 2022. 

Adjusted Gross Sales . Increase by 480 
due to increased volume during 2022. 

General and Administrative Expenses .
General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were up by 60 vs 2021 largely due to an increase in depreciation
expense related to assets purchased for the Alvey oil field. 

Professional fees . These fees are largely
made up of audit and audit-related fees 48,652 and 19,293 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively). The increase in audit/audit-related
fees is due to the Company s initial audit performed in 2022 as well as the preparation of an S-1 Registration Statement filed in
September 2022. 

Consulting fees . Increased by 67 due
to a full year of paying consultants working in various capacities including management, field work, research, sales, marketing and legal
advisory services. Since fundraising did not begin in earnest until 2021 and initial monies were invested in trying to get the Alvey field
operational, several consultants did not start collecting fees until the latter part of 2021. As such, 2022 is more representative of
a typical year. 

Other Income (Expense). Much of this
is related to the issuance and conversion of convertible debentures used to raise money for the Company s operations. 1,461,000
and 1,175,000 was raised by the sale of convertible debentures in 2022 and 2021, respectively. During 2022, 2,250,000 of these convertible
debentures were exchanged for common shares of stock. Since convertible debentures issued before March 31, 2022 did not contain a floor
price, estimates needed to be performed to determine the Change in fair value of the derivatives, Loss on issuance of derivatives as well
as Gain on extinguishment of debt when the debentures were converted to common shares. In addition, the change in Interest expense of
 833,899 was largely due to the amortization of debt discount of 1,111,820 which offset the decrease in Debt issue costs of 250,742.
Interest expense is comprised of Debt issue costs, Amortization of debt discount and Interest expense. 

Net Income (Loss). The above changes
resulted in net income of 1,479,362 in 2022 compared to a net loss of (3,749,667) in 2021. As noted in Other Income (Expense) ,
these large changes were largely due to accounting for derivatives due to the issuance of convertible debentures and 2022 conversion into
common stock as noted above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had total assets
of 2,871,855 including current assets of 392,820. We also have current liabilities of 440,637 which consist of
accounts payable of 149,835 and short-term loans payable of 277,613. We also have 517,859 of long-term liabilities consisting of notes
payable for the Alvey Oil field leasehold improvements of 183,657 and convertible notes of 334,202. We believe our ability
to achieve commercial success and continued growth will be dependent upon our continued access to capital either through sale of additional
convertible debentures, sale of our equity or cash generated from operations. We will attempt to obtain additional capital through private
investors; however, we have no agreements or understandings with third parties at this time in regards to investing additional monies.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
Cyber Enviro-Tech Inc. 

 Opinion on the Financial Statements 

 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of Cyber Enviro-Tech Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders 
equity (deficit), and cash flows for the year end December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related notes and schedules (collectively referred
to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period then ended, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

 Substantial Doubt about the Company s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

 The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3, the Company just began operations and has
insufficient revenue. These factors, and the need for additional financing in order for the Company to meet its business plans raises
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified with respect to that matter. 

 Basis for Opinion 

 These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

 Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

/s/ Accell Audit Compliance, P.A. 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2022.

 NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

 Basis
of presentation 

 The
Company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America U.S. GAAP ). 

 Use
of estimates 

 The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

 Revenue
recognition 

 The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers, Topic 606 ). Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services.
In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts
with customers. The amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for
those goods. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: (i) identification of the promised
goods in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct
in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv)
allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies
each performance obligation. 

 The
Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled
to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic
606 at contract inception, the Company reviews the contract to determine which performance obligations the Company must deliver and which
of these performance obligations are distinct. The Company expects to recognize revenues as the amount of the transaction price that
is allocated to the respective performance obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied. 

 The
Company recognizes sales when oil is picked up by the delivery company and control passes to the customer. 

 Cash
equivalents 

 The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. There
were no cash equivalents at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

F- 7 

Property
and Equipment 

 Property
and equipment is recorded at cost. Cost of improvements that substantially extend the useful lives of the assets are capitalized. Maintenance
and repair costs are expensed when incurred. When other property and equipment is sold or retired, the capitalized costs and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts. 

 Asset
Retirement Obligations 

 To
cover the estimated future asset retirement obligations ARO related to its oil and gas properties, the Company maintains
a 50,000 bond with the Railroad Commission of Texas RRC ). This bond is to ensure that the Company will cap any wells
on the Alvey Oil Field that it decides are no longer productive. Once the Company decides it is finished working the Alvey Oil Field,
it can apply to the RRC to have the bond repaid. 

 The
Company believes the bond should cover the estimated liability for abandoning wells. Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes
in estimated abandonment costs, changes in well economic lives, or if federal or state regulators enact new requirements regarding the
abandonment of wells 

 Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets 

 In
accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, as set forth in Topic 360 of
the ASC, the Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of its non-oil and gas long-lived assets when events occur that
indicate an impairment in value may exist. An impairment loss is indicated if the sum of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows
is less than the carrying amount of the assets. If this occurs, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. 

 Oil
and Gas Producing Activities 

 The
Company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas activities. Under this method, the costs of productive
exploratory wells, all development wells, related asset retirement obligation assets, and productive leases are capitalized and
amortized, principally by field, on a units-of-production basis over the life of the remaining proved reserves. Exploration costs,
including personnel costs, geological and geophysical expenses, and delay rentals for oil and gas leases are charged to expense as
incurred. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized, but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to
have found reserves in commercial quantities. The sale of a partial interest in a proved property is accounted for as a cost
recovery, and no gain or loss is recognized as long as this treatment does not significantly affect the units-of-production
amortization rate. A gain or loss is recognized for all other sales of producing properties. There were capitalized costs of
 1,604,983 and 482,106 at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

 Unproved
oil and gas properties are assessed annually to determine whether they have been impaired by the drilling of dry holes on or near the
related acreage or other circumstances, which may indicate a decline in value. When impairment occurs, a loss is recognized. When leases
for unproved properties expire, the costs thereof, net of any related allowance for impairment, is removed from the accounts and charged
to expense. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there was no impairment to unproved properties. The sale of a partial
interest in an unproved property is accounted for as a recovery of cost when substantial uncertainty exists as to the ultimate recovery
of the cost applicable to the interest retained. A gain on the sale is recognized to the extent that the sales price exceeds the carrying
amount of the unproved property. A gain or loss is recognized for all other sales of unproved properties. For the years ending December
31, 2022 and 2021, there was no gain or loss recognized for sales of unproved properties. 

 Costs
associated with development wells that are unevaluated or are waiting on access to transportation or processing facilities are reclassified
into developmental wells-in-progress WIP ). These costs are not put into a depletable field basis until the wells are fully
evaluated or access is gained to transportation and processing facilities. Costs associated with WIP are included in the cash flows from
investing as part of investment in oil and gas properties. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, no capitalized developmental costs
were included in WIP. 

 Depreciation,
depletion and amortization of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the units-of-production method based on proved reserves
and estimated salvage values. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded no depreciation, depletion and
amortization expense on oil and gas properties. The Company will start using the units-of-production method when the field is continuously
operational and there are material sales. 

F- 8 

The
Company reviews its proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in
the recoverability of its carrying value may have occurred. It estimates the undiscounted future net cash flows of its oil and natural
gas properties and compares such undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and natural gas properties to determine
if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the Company will
adjust the carrying amount of the oil and natural gas properties to fair value. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there
was no impairment to proved properties. 

 Stock-based
Compensation 

 The
Company applies the fair value method of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 718, Share Based Payment , in accounting for its stock-based compensation. This standard states that compensation cost is
measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting
period. The Company values stock-based compensation at the market price for the Company s common stock and other pertinent factors
at the grant date. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded 88,019 and
 53,205 in stock-based compensation expense, respectively. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

 The
Company adopted ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements . ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods
for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 

Level
 1: 
 Quoted
 market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. 

Level
 2: 
 Pricing
 inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the
 reporting date. 

Level
 3: 
 Pricing
 inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data. 

The
carrying amount of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses and accrued expenses approximate
their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The Company s notes payable approximates the fair value
of such instruments as the notes bear interest rates that are consistent with current market rates. 

The
Company evaluates convertible instruments, options, warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components
of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . 
The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the derivative is marked to market each balance sheet date and recorded
as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of
operations as other income (expense). Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value
at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity. Equity instruments that are initially classified as equity
that become subject to reclassification under ASC 815 are reclassified to liabilities at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification
date. 

At
year ended December 31, 2022, all convertible notes with a derivative liability were converted to common stock so there were no derivative
liabilities as of December 31, 2022. The following table classifies the Company s liability measured at fair value on a recurring
basis into the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2021:

Income
taxes 

 Income
states are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases and operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measures
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expect to be recovered
or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes
the enactment date. 

F- 9 

The
Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized
income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or
measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits as a component of general and administrative expenses. The Company s federal tax return and any state
tax returns are not currently under examination. 

 The
Company has adopted ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes , which requires an asset and lability approach to financial
accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually from differences between
the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based
on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances
are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. 

 Net
income (loss) per common share 

 The
Company computes loss per common share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share , which requires dual presentation
of basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic income or loss per common share is computed by dividing net income or loss by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income or loss per common share is computed by dividing net income
or loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, plus the issuance of common shares, if dilutive, that could result
from the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants. 

 Concentration
of credit risks 

 The
Company maintains accounts with financial institutions. All cash in checking accounts is non-interest bearing and is fully secured by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). At times, cash balances may exceed the maximum coverage provided by the FDIC on insured
depositor accounts. The Company believes it mitigates its risk by depositing its cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions. 

 Recently
issued accounting pronouncements 

 The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact
on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements
that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 

 NOTE
3 GOING CONCERN 

 The
Company s financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will be able to realize
its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has
just begun generating revenue and does not yet have sufficient revenue to cover its operating expenses. These factors raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon
generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet the Company s obligations and repay
its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next
twelve months with increased revenue and private placement loans or institutional investors. While the Company believes that it will
be successful in obtaining the necessary financing and generating revenue to fund the Company s operations, meet regulatory requirements
and achieve commercial goals, there are no assurances that such additional funding will be achieved and that the Company will succeed
in its future operations. 

 While
the Company has not experienced any significant impairment due to the COVID-19 environment, it has experienced some supply chain disruptions
which has delayed getting its oil field back into full production. In addition, the Company s future expansion may be negatively
impacted as it looks to hire more contractors to increase its operations. 

 The
financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

F- 10 

NOTE
4 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

 During
the normal course of business, the Company may be exposed to litigation. When the Company becomes aware of potential litigation, it evaluates
the merits of the case in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies . The Company evaluates its exposure to the matter, possible legal
or settlement strategies and the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome. If the Company determines that an unfavorable outcome is probable
and can be reasonably estimated, it establishes the necessary accruals. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company is
not aware of any contingent liabilities related to potential litigation that should be reflected in the financial statements. 

 In
February 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to operate the wells on the Alvey Oil Field. Under this agreement, the Company owes
a contingent amount based upon a 18.75 of the Working Interest less any rework and production costs to the Estate of Danny Hyde EDH)
the former owner of the operator of record for the Alvey Oil Field. The rework costs incurred by the Company to date have been over 1
million so it is not anticipated any contingent payments will be made to EDH in 2022. In addition, the Company owes 20 of gross sales
less severance tax to the landowners. At the same time of this agreement, the Company purchased 450,000 of equipment from the entity
formerly owned by Danny Hyde. The Company is still evaluating the allocation of that purchase price to various assets acquired and potential
liabilities assumed. The final allocation may be different than the current presentation.

Notes
payable 

 In
February 2021, the Company purchased certain oil and gas production equipment in the Alvey Oil Field. The total purchase price was 450,000 389,046 after discount). As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had repaid 106,500 and 75,000, respectively leaving
a balance of 343,500 and 375,000 respectively. The remaining amount due is paid in installments of 10,500 over an 18-month period
of time that began in July 2022, with a balloon payment of any unpaid balance after 18 months. The note has an imputed interest rate
of 7 . 

 At December 31, 2022, the Company had a note
payable to a shareholder for 100,000 along with interest of 10,000. Repayment was due in January 2023. The shareholder decided to take
 50,000 in cash and converted the remaining 60,000 to common stock. 

 At December 31, 2022, the Company had a
note payable to a related party for 15,000 with an interest rate of 7 . This loan was paid off in January 2023. 

 Convertible
notes payable 

 During
the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company received 1,175,000 from the issuance of twenty-nine separate convertible notes payable
and none of these was paid off during the year 2021. Each note bears interest at 7 . Accrued interest must be paid after twelve months
and then paid quarterly. Each note holder will receive 10,000 shares of commons stock for every 25,000 loaned to the Company at the
time of conversion which were valued at 94,959. All of these notes were converted during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

 During
the first nine months of 2022, the Company received 775,000 from the issuance of seventeen separate convertible notes payable. For convertible
notes payable issued before March 31, 2022, each note bears interest at 7 . Accrued interest must be paid after twelve months and then
paid quarterly. Each note holder will receive 10,000 shares of commons stock for every 25,000 loaned to the Company at the time of conversion.
All the notes issued in 2021 and in the first quarter of 2022 were converted to common shares as of March 31, 2022. 

 For the 700,000 worth of convertible notes
payable issued after March 31, 2022 and before December 21, 2022, the terms of the notes were the same as before except for a change of
a minimum conversion price of 0.40/share and a maximum conversion price of 1.50/share. The maturity dates for these notes payable are
between May 2024 and September 2024 and are convertible after nine months at a 30 discount to the average closing price for the prior
two weeks. The notes issued after March 31, 2022 are not considered to be derivatives. All the notes issued in the second and third quarter
of 2022 were converted to common shares as of September 15, 2022 and therefore balance for these convertible debentures was zero as of
December 31, 2022. 

 For convertible notes payable issued after
December 20, 2022, the terms of the notes were the same as before except for the change of a minimum conversion price of 0.10/share and
a maximum conversion price of 1.50/share. The maturity dates for these notes payable are in December 2024 and are convertible after nine
months at a 30 discount to the average closing price for the prior two weeks. As noted above, any notes issued after March 31, 2022 are
not considered to be derivatives. The balance for these convertible notes payable was 386,000 as of December 31, 2022. 

 During the first nine months of 2022, 2,250,000
of non-related party convertible notes payable plus accrued interest were converted into common stock at a total of 6,214,355 shares.
This conversion also created a one-time gain on the extinguishment of the debt of 627,591 as well as a write off of the derivative liability
associated with these notes of 3,512,747. 

 In 2020, the Company executed a convertible note payable with
a related party for 25,000 that is unsecured, non-interest bearing and convertible into shares of common stock at 0.001. This note
matured on September 23, 2020 and is in default. 

 Derivative
instruments 

 Some
of the Company s convertible notes payable issued gave rise to derivative financial instruments. The notes embodied certain terms
and conditions that were not clearly and closely related to the host debt agreement in terms of economic risks and characteristics. These
terms and features consist of embedded conversion option. 

Current
accounting principles that are provided in ASC 815 require derivative financial instruments to be classified in liabilities and carried
at fair value with changes recorded in income. In addition, the standards do not permit an issuer to account separately for individual
derivative terms and features embedded in hybrid financial instruments that require bifurcation and liability classification as a derivative
financial instrument. Rather, such terms and features must be bundled together and fair valued as a single, compound embedded derivative.
The Company has selected the Monte Carlo Simulations valuation technique to fair value the compound embedded derivative because it believes
that this technique is reflective of all significant assumption and redemption behaviors in addition to traditional inputs for option
models such as market trading volatility and risk-free rates. The Monte Carlo Simulations technique is a level three valuation technique
because it requires the development of significant internal assumptions in addition to observable market indicators.

10 INCOME TAXES 

 Deferred
taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating
loss, and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences
are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a
valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of
enactment. The U.S. federal income tax rate of 21 is being used. 

Income
taxes consist of the following components as of:

NOTE
12 SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND GAS DISCLOSURES (UNAUDITED) 

 In
accordance with ASC 932, Extractive Activities- Oil and Gas, the Company is required to provide additional information regarding
its oil and gas producing activities when those activities are deemed to be significant. According to ASC 932, significance is defined
as satisfying one or more of the following criteria: the revenues from oil and gas are 10 or more of total revenues; the operating income
(loss) from oil and gas are 10 or more of total income (loss) from operations; the identifiable assets of oil and gas are 10 or more
of total assets. In 2022 and 2021, the Company s oil and gas activities were deemed to be significant since the operating loss
from oil and gas is 10 or more of total loss from operations. In addition, there was 85,356 and 14,332 of oil sales as for the years
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Oil
and Gas Reserves 

 There
are several factors that need to be considered in estimating quantities of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. Crude oil and natural
gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely
measured. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation
and judgment. Results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate.
Accordingly, reserves estimates are often different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. 

 Proved
oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with
reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic
conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate
expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are
used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that
it will commence the project within a reasonable time. 

Existing
economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic productivity from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be
the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted
arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements,
excluding escalations based upon future conditions. For the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021, that price would be 94.13 and 66.36,
respectively. 

Proved
reserves are estimated quantities of oil, gas and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable
certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The reserve volumes
presented are estimates only and should not be construed as being exact quantities. 

The Company s 479-acre oil field is
located in West Texas. P er the Preliminary Reserve Estimate done by an independent geologist, it is estimated
to contain 150 million barrels of oil. The geologist estimates the recovery factor at 30 to 40 of the total reserves. Based on the lower
estimated quantity and lower the recovery factor, the total barrels of recoverable oil for would be around 44.8 million barrels. The average
price of West Texas Intermediate oil for the year ending December 31, 2022 was 94.13. This would give an estimated total value of recoverable
oil at approximately 4.2 billion. The cost of production would be around 1.0 billion which
would leave a net of approximately 3.2 billion.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting
and Financial Disclosure. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls
and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

 As required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15
or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer (our principal executive officer)
and our chief financial officer (our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, being December 31, 2022. 

 Based on this evaluation, these officers concluded
that, as of December 31, 2022 these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that the information required to be
disclosed by our company in reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities Exchange Commission. The conclusion that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective was due to the Company was lacking in pre-planning for expenses and documentation of transactions
and two material journal entries made by the auditors one for underreporting of expenses by 25,750 and another for overreporting
of expenses by 50,000. On the adjustments, both were valid expenses but recorded in the wrong years. 

 Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within our
company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that
breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. 

 Management's Annual Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The term internal control over financial reporting 
is defined as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, an issuer's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the issuer's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 

(1) Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer; and 

(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the issuer. 

Under the supervision of our chief executive
officer, being our principal executive officer, and our chief financial officer, being our principal financial officer and principal accounting
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 using
the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls,
testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded
our internal control over financial reporting were not effective at December 31, 2022. 

 A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a more than remote possibility that a misstatement
of our company's annual or interim financial statements could occur. In its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, we determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses
which are indicative of many small companies with small staff, such as: 

(1) 
 
 inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and 

(2) 
 insufficient written policies and procedures for documenting all transactions with vendors. 

Our management is currently evaluating remediation
plans for the above deficiencies. During the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K, we have been able to remediate some of
the weaknesses described above. However, we plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial
reporting.
