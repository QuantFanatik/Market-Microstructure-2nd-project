 WAB operates the following full-service banking divisions: ABA, BON, Bridge, FIB, and TPB. The Company also provides an array of specialized financial services to business customers across the country, including mortgage banking services through AmeriHome, and has added to its capabilities with the acquisition of DST on January 25, 2022, which provides digital payment services for the class action legal industry. In addition, the Company has the following non-bank subsidiaries: CSI, a captive insurance company formed and licensed under the laws of the State of Arizona and established as part of the Company's overall enterprise risk management strategy, and WATC, which will provide corporate trust services and levered loan administration solutions. 
 WAL also has eight unconsolidated subsidiaries used as business trusts in connection with issuance of trust-preferred securities as described in "Note 12. Qualifying Debt" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
 Bank Subsidiary 
 At December 31, 2022, WAL has the following bank subsidiary: 
 Bank Name Headquarters Location Cities Total Assets Net Loans Deposits (in millions) Western Alliance Bank Phoenix, Arizona Arizona: Chandler, Flagstaff, Gilbert, Mesa, Phoenix, Scottsdale, and Tucson 
 67,684 52,737 53,918 Nevada: Carson City, Fallon, Henderson, Las Vegas, Mesquite, Reno, and Sparks

 WAB also has the following significant wholly-owned subsidiaries: 
 WABT holds certain investment securities, municipal and non-profit loans, and leases. 
 WA PWI holds interests in certain limited partnerships invested primarily in low income housing tax credits and small business investment corporations. 
 BW Real Estate, Inc. operates as a real estate investment trust and holds certain of WAB's real estate loans and related securities. 
 Helios Prime, Inc. holds certain equity interests in renewable energy tax credit transactions. 
 Western Finance Company purchases and originates equipment finance leases and provides mortgage banking services through its wholly-owned subsidiary, AmeriHome.

 Market Segments 
 The Company's reportable segments are aggregated with a focus on products and services offered and consist of three reportable segments: 
 Commercial: provides commercial banking and treasury management products and services to small and middle-market businesses, specialized banking services to sophisticated commercial institutions and investors within niche industries, as well as financial services to the real estate industry. 
 Consumer Related: offers both commercial banking services to enterprises in consumer-related sectors and consumer banking services, such as residential mortgage banking and beginning on January 25, 2022, includes the financial results of DST, which provides digital payment services for the class action legal industry. 
 5 

Table of Contents 

 Corporate Other: consists of the Company's investment portfolio, Corporate borrowings and other related items, income and expense items not allocated to other reportable segments, and inter-segment eliminations. 
 Loan and deposit accounts are typically assigned directly to the segments where these products are originated and/or serviced. Equity capital is assigned to each segment based primarily on the risk profile of their assets and liabilities. Any excess equity not allocated to segments based on risk is assigned to the Corporate Other segment. 
 Net interest income, provision for credit losses, and non-interest expense amounts are recorded in their respective segments to the extent that the amounts are directly attributable to those segments. Net interest income of a reportable segment includes a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. Using this funds transfer pricing methodology, liquidity is transferred between users and providers. Net income amounts for each reportable segment are further derived by the use of expense allocations. Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific segment are allocated across all segments based on key metrics, such as number of employees, number of transactions processed for loans and deposits, and average loan and deposit balances. Income taxes are applied to each segment based on the effective tax rate for the geographic location of the segment. Any difference in the corporate tax rate and the aggregate effective tax rates in the segments are adjusted in the Corporate Other segment. 
 Lending Activities 
 General 
 The Company s lending has focused primarily on meeting the needs of business customers. Through WAB and its banking divisions and operating subsidiaries, the Company provides a variety of lending products to customers, including the loan types discussed below. 
 Commercial and Industrial: Commercial and industrial loans are a significant portion of the Company's loan portfolio, representing 40 and 47 of the Company's HFI loan portfolio as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These loans include working capital lines of credit, loans to technology companies, inventory and accounts receivable lines, mortgage warehouse lines, and other commercial loans. Equipment loans and leases, tax-exempt municipalities, and not-for-profit organizations are also categorized as commercial and industrial loans. 
 CRE: Loans to fund the purchase or refinancing of CRE for investors (non-owner occupied) or owner occupants are a significant portion of the Company's loan portfolio. These CRE loans are secured by multi-family residential properties, professional offices, industrial facilities, retail centers, hotels, and other commercial properties. Approximately 16 and 13 of the Company's CRE investor portfolio consisted of office loans as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These office loans are primarily shorter-term bridge loans that enable borrowers to reposition or redevelop projects and are geographically well diversified, with the vast majority located in midtown or suburban locations. At the time of origination, these loans have an initial loan-to-value ratio of less than 55 and a weighted average loan-to-cost of less than 60 . The properties underlying these loans have stable business trends and low vacancy rates. In addition, conservative underwriting focused on loan-to-cost lending with significant up-front sponsor cash equity, re-appraisal rights by the Company, re-margining requirements and ongoing debt service and debt yield covenants mitigates asset-type credit risk and provides for ongoing sponsor support of and commitment to projects. 
 Substantially all of the Company's remaining CRE loans are secured by first liens with an initial loan-to-value ratio of generally not more than 75 . As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, 16 and 23 of the Company's CRE loans were owner occupied. Owner occupied CRE loans are loans secured by owner occupied non-farm nonresidential properties for which the primary source of repayment (more than 50 is the cash flow from the ongoing operations and activities conducted by the borrower who owns the property. Non-owner occupied CRE loans are CRE loans for which the primary source of repayment is rental income generated from the collateral property. 
 Construction and Land Development: Construction and land development loans include single family and multi-family residential projects, industrial/warehouse properties, office buildings, retail centers, medical office facilities, and residential lot developments. These loans are primarily originated to experienced local and national developers with whom the Company has a satisfactory lending history. An analysis of each construction project is performed as part of the underwriting process to determine whether the type of property, location, construction costs, and contingency funds are appropriate and adequate. Loans to finance commercial raw land are primarily to borrowers who plan to initiate active development of the property within two years.

Table of Contents 

 Residential: The Company executes flow and bulk residential loan purchases that meet the Company's goals and underwriting criteria through its residential mortgage acquisition program. These loan purchases consist of both conforming and non-conforming loans. Non-conforming loan purchases are considered to be high quality as the borrowers have high FICO scores and the loans generally have low loan-to-values. 
 Consumer: Limited types of consumer loans are offered to meet customer demand and to respond to community needs. Examples of these consumer loans include home equity loans and lines of credit, home improvement loans, personal lines of credit, and loans to individuals for investment purposes. 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company's HFI loan portfolio totaled 51.9 billion, or approximately 77 of total assets. The following table sets forth the composition of the Company's HFI loan portfolio: 
 December 31, 2022 2021 Amount Percent Amount Percent (dollars in millions) Commercial and industrial 20,710 39.9 18,297 46.8 Commercial real estate - non-owner occupied 9,319 18.0 6,526 16.7 Commercial real estate - owner occupied 1,818 3.5 1,898 4.9 Construction and land development 4,013 7.7 3,023 7.7 Residential real estate 15,928 30.7 9,282 23.8 Consumer 74 0.2 49 0.1 Loans HFI, net of deferred loan fees and costs 51,862 100.0 39,075 100.0 Allowance for credit losses (310) (252) Net loans HFI 51,552 38,823 
 For additional information concerning loans, see "Note 5. Loans, Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses" in Item 8 or "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition Loans" in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 
 The Company adheres to a specific set of credit standards that are intended to ensure appropriate management of credit risk. Furthermore, the Bank's senior management team plays an active role in monitoring compliance with such standards. 
 Loan originations are subject to a process that includes the credit evaluation of borrowers, utilizing established lending limits, analysis of collateral, and procedures for continual monitoring and identification of credit deterioration. Loan officers actively monitor their individual credit relationships in order to report suspected risks and potential downgrades as early as possible. The BOD approves all material changes to loan policy, as well as lending limit authorities. The Bank's lending policies generally incorporate consistent underwriting standards across all geographic regions in which the Bank operates, customized as necessary to conform to state law and local market conditions. The Bank's credit culture emphasizes timely identification of troubled credits to allow management to take prompt corrective action, when necessary. 
 Loan Approval Procedures and Authority 
 The Company's loan approval procedures are executed through a tiered loan limit authorization process, which is structured as follows: 
 Individual Credit Authorities. The credit approval levels for individual divisional and senior credit officers are set by policy and certain credit administration officers' approval authorities are established on a delegated basis. 
 Management Loan Committees. Credits in excess of individual divisional or senior credit officer approval authority are submitted to the appropriate divisional or NBL loan committee. The divisional committees consist of members of the Bank's senior management team of each division and the NBL loan committees consist of the Bank's divisional or senior credit officers. 
 Credit Administration. Credits in excess of the divisional or NBL loan committee approval authority require the additional approval of the Bank's CCO and any credits in excess of the CCO's individual approval authority are submitted to the WAB SLC. In addition, the SLC reviews all other loan approvals to any one new borrower in excess of established thresholds. The SLC is chaired by the WAB CCO and includes the Company s CEO.

Table of Contents 

 Loans to One Borrower. In addition to the limits set forth above, subject to certain exceptions, state banking laws generally limit the amount of funds that a bank may lend to a single borrower. Under Arizona law, the obligations of one borrower to a bank generally may not exceed 20 of the bank s capital, plus an additional 10 of its capital if the additional amounts are fully secured by readily marketable collateral. Arizona law does not specifically require aggregation of loans to affiliated entities in determining compliance with the lending limit. As a matter of longstanding practice, the Arizona Department of Financial Institutions uses the same aggregation analysis as applied to national banks by the OCC. 
 Concentrations of Credit Risk. The Company's lending policies also establish customer and product concentration limits for its HFI and HFS loan portfolios, which are based on outstanding amounts, to control single customer and product exposures. The Company's lending policies have several different measures to limit concentration exposures. Set forth below are the primary segmentation limits and actual measures based on outstanding amounts as of December 31, 2022: 
 Percent of Tier 1 Capital and ACL Policy Limit Actual Loans HFI CRE 295 193 Commercial and industrial 485 359 Construction and land development 85 70 Residential real estate 300 276 Consumer 10 1 Loans HFS Residential real estate 215 21 
 Asset Quality 
 General 
 To measure asset quality, the Company has instituted a loan grading system consisting of nine different categories. The first five are considered satisfactory "pass" ratings. The other four "non-pass" grades range from a Special mention category to a Loss category and are consistent with the grading systems used by federal banking regulators. All loans are assigned a credit risk grade at the time they are made and formally reviewed on a quarterly basis as part of the Company's loan grade certification process to identify loans that may be exhibiting early-warning signs of credit stress and determine whether a change in the credit risk grade is warranted. In addition, the grading of the Company's loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis by its internal Loan Review Department. 
 Collection Procedure 
 Bank personnel are responsible for monitoring activity that may indicate an increased risk rating, including, but not limited to, past-dues, overdrafts, and loan agreement covenant defaults. If a borrower fails to make a scheduled payment on a loan, Bank personnel attempt to remedy the deficiency by contacting the borrower and seeking payment. Contact is generally made within 15 business days after the payment becomes past due. The Bank also maintains a special assets department, which generally services and collects loans rated Substandard or worse. Loans deemed uncollectible are charged-off. 
 Nonperforming Assets 
 Nonperforming assets include loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest (that are not government guaranteed), non-accrual and TDR loans, and repossessed assets, including OREO. In general, loans are placed on non-accrual status when the Company determines that ultimate collection of principal and interest is in doubt due to the borrower s financial condition, collateral value, and collection efforts. In addition, the Company considers all loans rated Substandard or lower to be experiencing financial difficulty. A TDR loan is a loan for which the Company, for reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that the Company would not otherwise consider. Other repossessed assets result from loans where the Company has received title or physical possession of the borrower s assets. The Company generally re-appraises OREO and collateral dependent non-residential loans with balances greater than 0.5 million every 12 months. The total net realized and unrealized gains and losses of repossessed and other assets was not significant during each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. However, losses may be experienced in future periods.

 Criticized Assets 
 Federal bank regulators require banks to classify its assets on a regular basis. In addition, in connection with their examinations of the Bank, examiners have authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, re-classify them. A loan grade of "Special Mention" from the Company's internal loan grading system is utilized to identify potential problem assets and loan grades of "Substandard," "Doubtful," and "Loss" are utilized to identify actual problem assets. 
 The following describes the potential and actual problem assets using the Company's internal loan grading system definitions: 
 "Special Mention" (Grade 6): Generally these are assets that possess potential weaknesses that warrant management's close attention. These loans may involve borrowers with adverse financial trends, higher debt to equity ratios, or weaker liquidity positions, but not to the degree of being considered a problem loan where risk of loss may be apparent. Loans in this category are usually performing as agreed, although there may be non-compliance with financial covenants. 
 Substandard (Grade 7): These assets are characterized by well-defined credit weaknesses and carry the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if such weakness or deficiency is not corrected. All loans 90 days or more past due and all loans on non-accrual status are considered at least "Substandard," unless extraordinary circumstances would suggest otherwise. 
 Doubtful (Grade 8): These assets have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as "Substandard" with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable, but because of certain known factors which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset (for example, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral and refinancing plans), classification as an estimated loss is deferred until a more precise status may be determined. 
 Loss (Grade 9): These assets are considered uncollectible and having such little recoverable value that it is not practical to defer writing off the asset. This classification does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practicable or desirable to defer writing off the asset, even though partial recovery may be achieved in the future. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit losses in each period is reflected as a reduction in earnings for that period and includes amounts related to funded loans, unfunded loan commitments, and investment securities. The provision is equal to the amount required to maintain the ACL at a level that is adequate to absorb estimated lifetime credit losses inherent in the loan and investment securities portfolios as well as off-balance sheet credit exposures. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to the ACL and subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to the ACL. The ACL on funded loans and investment securities are presented as a reduction to the respective asset balance on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The ACL on unfunded loan commitments is classified in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For a detailed discussion of the Company s methodology see Management s Discussion and Analysis and Financial Condition Critical Accounting Policies Allowance for Credit Losses in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 
 Investment Activities 
 The Company has an investment policy, which is approved by the BOD on an annual basis. This policy dictates that investment decisions be made based on the safety of the investment, liquidity requirements of the Bank and holding company, potential returns, cash flow targets, and consistency with the Company's interest rate risk management.

 Deposit Products 
 The Company offers a variety of deposit products, including demand deposits, checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, and other types of deposit accounts, including fixed-rate, fixed maturity certificates of deposit. The Company has historically focused on growing its lower cost core customer deposits. As of December 31, 2022, the deposit portfolio was comprised of 37 non-interest-bearing deposits and 63 interest-bearing deposits. 
 The competition for deposits in the Company's markets is strong. The Company has historically been successful in attracting and retaining deposits due to several factors, including its: 
 knowledgeable and empowered bankers committed to providing personalized and responsive service that translates into long lasting relationships; 
 broad selection of cash management services offered; and 
 incentives to employees for business development and retention. 
 Deposit balances are generally influenced by national and local economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, competitiveness of offered rates, perceived stability of financial institutions, and competition. In order to attract and retain deposits, the Company relies on providing quality service and introducing new products and services that meet the needs of its customers. 
 The Bank's deposit rates are determined through an internal oversight process under the direction of its ALCO. The Bank considers a number of factors when determining deposit rates, including: 
 current and projected national and local economic conditions and the outlook for interest rates; 
 competition from other institutions; 
 loan and deposit positions and forecasts, including any concentrations in either; and 
 alternative borrowing costs from the FHLB or other sources. 
 The following table shows the Company's deposit composition: 
 December 31, 2022 2021 Amount Percent Amount Percent (in millions) Non-interest-bearing demand deposits 19,691 36.7 21,353 44.9 Interest-bearing transaction accounts 9,507 17.7 6,924 14.5 Savings and money market accounts 19,397 36.2 17,279 36.3 Time certificates of deposit 250,000 or more) 3,815 7.1 523 1.1 Other time deposits 1,234 2.3 1,533 3.2 Total deposits 53,644 100.0 47,612 100.0 
 Although the Company does not pay interest to depositors of non-interest-bearing accounts, earnings credits and referral fees are awarded to some account holders, which offset charges incurred by account holders for other services. Earnings credits and referral fees earned in excess of charges incurred by account holders are recorded in deposit costs as part of non-interest expense and fluctuate as a result of eligible deposit balances and rates on these deposit balances. 
 In addition to the Company's deposit base, it has access to other sources of funding, including FHLB and FRB advances, Federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements, and secured and unsecured lines of credit with other financial institutions. Previously, the Company has also accessed the capital markets through trust preferred, credit linked note, subordinated debt, and Senior Note offerings. For additional information concerning the Company's deposits, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Balance Sheet Analysis Deposits in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 
 Other Financial Products and Services 
 In addition to traditional commercial banking activities, the Company offers other financial services to its customers, including internet banking, wire transfers, electronic bill payment and presentment, 24/7 funds transfer and other digital payment offerings, lock box services, courier, and cash management services.

 Customer, Product, and Geographic Concentrations 
 Commercial and industrial loans make up 40 and 47 of the Company's HFI loan portfolio as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In addition, 29 of the Company's loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was represented by CRE and construction and land development loans. The Company s CRE business is concentrated primarily in the Phoenix, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Reno, San Francisco, San Jose, San Diego and Tucson metropolitan areas. Consequently, the Company is dependent on the trends of these regional economies. 
 The Company is not dependent upon any single or limited number of customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its reportable segments have customer relationships that individually account for 10 or more of consolidated or segment revenues. No material portion of the Company s business is seasonal. 
 Competition 
 The financial services industry is highly competitive and has been significantly impacted by federal and state legislation that makes it easier for non-bank financial institutions to compete with the Company. The Company competes for loans, deposits, and customers with other banks, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, financial technology firms, and other non-bank financial services providers. This strong competition for deposit and loan products directly affects the interest rates on those products and the terms on which they are offered to customers. In addition, many of the Company's competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization and are able to offer a broader range of financial services than the Company can offer. Technological innovation and capabilities, including changes in product delivery systems and web-based tools, also continue to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets and larger competitors may be able to allocate more resources to these technology initiatives. 
 Human Capital Resources 
 The Company s culture is defined by its corporate values of integrity, creativity, teamwork, passion, and excellence. People, Performance, and Possibilities capture the Company's defining values and behaviors that shape our unique culture and how we do business. People are the foundation of the Company and the Company invests in their success by providing expanded opportunities to attract and retain its people. Our people are committed to our clients success and, by putting clients first, we create strong shareholder performance. This leads to tremendous possibilities to fuel client growth and support the Company s communities. 
 The Company is deeply committed to giving back to the communities where it does business and strives to help low-to-moderate income geographies become healthier and more sustainable communities. Employees are encouraged to dedicate their time and expertise to charitable and civic organizations they are passionate about. In total, employees have volunteered more than 25,000 hours since 2020. The Company is also committed to providing financial support for education, affordable housing, and community development lending and investments. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company employed 3,365 full-time equivalent employees in its branches and loan production offices across the United States, an increase of 7 from December 31, 2021 due to continued organic growth. The Company s employees are not represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
 The Company is committed to improving workforce diversity at all levels of the organization and to providing equal opportunity in all aspects of employment. In 2022, the Company continued to make progress towards enhancing its ability to attract and retain a diverse population of employees. The Company has built relationships with community and educational institutions to strengthen its pipelines of talent in underrepresented communities. The Company has established an executive-led Opportunity Council, which guides and sponsors DEI initiatives, provides access to leadership, and evaluates organizational and best practice DEI strategies. Overall, the Opportunity Council is focused on accelerating DEI activities and results. One aspect of this work is the active support of Business Resource Groups focused on the career advancement of diverse groups within the Company, such as women, minority groups, and LGBTQIA+ employees. These groups foster opportunities to engage in programs, network with peers, and connect with Bank leadership.

 The Company employs a diverse workforce that reflects its communities, which is shown in the Company's ethnic and gender diversity metrics presented in the table below: 
 December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (as a percentage of total employees) Employees belonging to an ethnic minority group 43 44 38 Female employees 52 55 58 
 Of the employees that are women, 44 occupy roles that involve supervising and managing other employees as of December 31, 2022, compared to 47 in the prior year. 
 The below table presents the ethnic and gender diversity metrics for the Company's BOD: 
 December 31, 2022 2021 (as a percentage of total directors) Directors belonging to an ethnic minority group 21 15 Female directors 21 15 
 The Company remains committed to increasing the share of women and minority groups in the ranks of its leadership and BOD. 
 Recruiting, Retention, and Talent Development 
 The Company recognizes that its success is highly dependent on its ability to attract, retain and develop employees. To foster this development, the Company has created three early talent identification programs, a college internship program, the CBDP, and iLead, the goal of each of which is to enhance management s ability to promote pathways for growth of future leaders. Campus recruitment initiatives and partnerships also help expand the Company s pipeline of talent. Within the internship program, college students and recent graduates are paired with leaders across the Company to create a valuable, immersive experience, with an objective of retaining promising interns and creating a pipeline for the CBDP or other roles. The CBDP is an 18-month, on-the-job development program to train successful credit analysts that offers progressive assignments, mentoring, opportunities to learn the business and various aspects of leadership, with the objective of developing future leaders of the Company. The iLead Program is an 18-month program for recent MBA graduates, designed to accelerate the development of high potential mid-career talent in sales or corporate career paths. Additionally, the Company has expanded its sales training and mentoring efforts to foster internal development within its commercial lending teams. 
 As a growing company, recruiting new talent to the organization is key to the Company s success and part of that objective includes building a diverse workforce that is representative of the communities that the Company serves. In 2022, 48 of WAB s open positions were filled by external candidates belonging to an ethnic minority group and 74 of promotions were awarded to ethnically diverse or female employees. The Company has made a commitment to growing the share of its employee population from diverse communities and has experienced success in recent years, although the Company believes there is still an opportunity for additional advancement in this area. 
 Retaining employees who have been key contributors to the Company's success story remains an important objective. The table below presents the Company's overall employee turnover rate: 
 Year ended December 31, 2022 (1) 2021 2020 Turnover Rate 17 19 13 
 (1) Excludes the impact of reductions in workforce during the period. 
 For 2022 compared to 2021, the turnover rate decreased from 19 to 17 . During 2022, the Company s residential mortgage banking workforce was reduced to align with lower residential mortgage loan production volumes compared to 2021, which was driven by rising interest rates throughout 2022. This reduction represented 7 of the Company s total 2021 employees.

Table of Contents 

 For 2021, the Company s turnover rate was impacted by the Great Resignation, which refers to the trend in which employees voluntarily resigned from their jobs in record numbers, with turnover rates highest among mid-career employees. In both 2022 and 2021, the Company's turnover rate was highest among employees in the Under 30 age group, as shown in the table below. 
 Year ended December 31, Turnover Rate by Age Group 2022 2021 Under 30 27 27 Between 30-50 15 19 Over 50 15 16 
 The Company also offers a variety of resources to help its employees grow in their current roles and build new skills, including online development programs and workshops, mentoring programs, and internal webinars that feature speakers from across the Company, sharing information about and success in their business line, division, or functional area. The Company encourages its employees to take an active role in their career and through the annual performance management process, employees are able to identify individual development goals and create an action plan to achieve these goals. 
 With the understanding that bias is a larger societal issue, the Company offers training to create awareness and understanding of everyday biases and micro-behaviors, and helps individuals to implement solutions to create a more inclusive workplace. This training is required for all employees and additional, focused trainings are required for all managers, including one specifically promoting inclusion. 
 Compensation and Benefits 
 The Company s compensation and benefits programs are designed to attract, retain, motivate, and reward employees to deliver strong performance and excellence. In addition to salaries, these programs include annual bonuses, stock awards, a 401(k) Plan with an employer matching contribution, healthcare, life insurance and other benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, and various paid time off benefits. Throughout the organization, 100 of employees participate in the annual bonus plan or are eligible to receive business incentives. 
 Health and Wellness 
 The Company is committed to supporting the wellness of its people, to enable their personal and professional productivity, improve physical and mental well-being, and provide support for optimal health at work and at home. To support these efforts, the Company has established Wellness Committees to engage its people in well-being initiatives that provide opportunities for employees to develop healthier lifestyles by promoting habits and attitudes that support wellness.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Investing in our common stock involves various risks, many of which are specific to our business. The discussion below addresses the material risks and uncertainties, of which we are currently aware, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Other risks that we do not know about now, or that we do not currently believe are material, could negatively impact our business or the trading price of our securities. Additionally, investors should not interpret the disclosure of a risk to imply that the risk has not already materialized. See additional discussions about credit, interest rate, market, and litigation risks in "Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 
 Market and Economic Risks 
 Our financial performance may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally. 
 Our financial performance is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where we operate and in the U.S. as a whole. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity, or investor or business confidence, limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital, increases in inflation or interest rates, US government debt default or shutdown, the imposition of tariffs on trade, natural disasters, the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), terrorist attacks, acts of war (including the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine), or a combination of these or other factors. 
 The specific impact on us of unfavorable or uncertain economic or market conditions is difficult to predict, could be long or short term, and may be indirect, such as disruptions in our customers' supply chain or a reduction in the demand for their products or services. A worsening of business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we conduct business could have adverse effects, including the following: 
 a decrease in deposit balances or the demand for loans and other products and services we offer; 
 an increase in the number of borrowers who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us, which could lead to higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, and provisions for credit losses; 
 a decrease in the value of loans and other assets or in the value of collateral; 
 a decrease in net interest income from our lending and deposit gathering activities; 
 an impairment of certain intangible assets such as goodwill; and 
 an increase in competition resulting from increasing consolidation within the financial services industry; and 
 an increase in borrowing costs in excess of changes in the rate at which we reinvest funds. 
 In the U.S. financial services industry, the soundness of financial institutions is closely interrelated because of credit, trading, clearing or other relationships between the institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as systemic risk and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms, and exchanges, with which we interact on a daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect us. 
 It is possible that the business environment in the U.S. will continue to be challenging or experience recession or additional volatility in the future. There can be no assurance that such conditions will improve in the near term or that conditions will not worsen. Such conditions could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 Changes in interest rates and increased rate competition could adversely affect our profitability, business, and prospects. 
 Most of our assets and liabilities reprice with changes in interest rates, which subjects us to significant risks from changes in interest rates and can impact our net interest income, mortgage banking revenues, the valuation of our assets and liabilities, and our ability to effectively manage our interest rate risk. 
 We derive a significant amount of our revenue from net interest income and, therefore, our net income depends heavily on our net interest margin. Net interest margin is the difference between the interest we receive on loans, securities, and other earning assets and the interest we pay on interest-bearing deposits, borrowings, and other liabilities. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including competition, general economic conditions, the slope of the interest rate curve, and monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities, including the FRB. In a rising rate environment, the rate of interest we pay on our interest-bearing deposits, borrowings, and other liabilities may increase more quickly than the rate of interest we receive on loans, securities, and other earning assets, which could adversely impact our net 
 15 

Table of Contents 

 interest income and earnings. Interest rates rose during 2022 and may continue to rise during 2023. As a result, we have experienced certain of the rising rate environment effects described herein. If interest rates continue to increase, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 
 Conversely, our earnings also could be adversely affected in a declining rate environment if the rates on our loans and other investments fall more quickly than those on our deposits and other liabilities. Because of our relatively high reliance on net interest income, our revenue and earnings are more sensitive to changes in market rates than other financial institutions that have more diversified sources of revenue. 
 Loan volumes are also affected by market interest rates on loans. Lower interest rates are usually associated with higher loan originations, but also result in higher loan refinancings which can result in lower average loan yields and the loss of future net servicing revenues on residential loans with an associated write-down of MSRs. In contrast, in rising interest rate environments, loan repayment rates generally decline and result in a lower volume of loan originations. In addition to the impact on our lending business, a decrease in loan originations would adversely affect the volume of loans available for purchase by our mortgage warehouse lending platform. 
 In addition to the potential effects on net interest margin and loan volumes, an increase in the general level of interest rates affected the ability of certain borrowers to pay interest and principal on their obligations and reduced the amount of non-interest income we can earn due to potentially lower levels of banking business conducted generally as well lower levels of servicing, gain on sale, and other revenues generated through our residential mortgage business. 
 Our financial instruments expose us to certain market risks and may increase the volatility of earnings and AOCI. 
 We hold certain financial instruments measured at fair value. For those financial instruments measured at fair value, we are required to recognize the changes in the fair value of such instruments in either earnings or AOCI each quarter. Therefore, any increases or decreases in the fair value of these financial instruments have a corresponding impact on reported earnings or AOCI. Fair value can be affected by a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including credit spreads, interest rate volatility, liquidity, and other economic factors. Accordingly, we are subject to mark-to-market risk and the application of fair value accounting may cause our earnings and AOCI to be more volatile than would be suggested by our underlying performance. 
 Due to the inherent risk associated with accounting estimates, our ACL may be insufficient, which could require us to raise additional capital or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Credit losses are an inherent risk in the business of making loans. Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio and maintains an ACL deemed to cover expected losses over the life of the loan portfolio. The measurement of expected credit losses takes place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet (with periodic updates thereafter) and is based on a number of factors, including the size of the portfolio, asset classifications, economic trends, industry experience and trends, industry and geographic concentrations, estimated collateral values, management s assessment of the credit risk inherent in the portfolio, loan underwriting policies, historical loan loss experience, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. In addition, with the exception of residential loans, we individually evaluate all loans identified as problem loans with a total commitment of 1.0 million or more, and establish an allowance based upon our estimation of the potential loss associated with those problem loans. Additions to the ACL recorded through our provision for credit losses decrease our net income. If management s assumptions and judgments are incorrect or if economic conditions worsen compared to forecast, our actual credit losses may exceed our ACL. 
 At December 31, 2022, our ACL on funded loans and loss contingency on unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit totals 309.7 million and 47.0 million, respectively. Deterioration in the real estate market or general economic conditions could affect the ability of our loan customers to service their debt, which could result in additional loan loss provisions and increases in our ACL. In addition, we may be required to record additional loan provisions or increase our ACL based on new information regarding existing loans, input from regulators in connection with their review of our loan portfolio, changes in regulatory guidance, regulations or accounting standards, identification of additional problem loans, changes in economic outlook, and other factors, both within and outside of our management s control. Moreover, because future events are uncertain and because we may not successfully identify all deteriorating loans in a timely manner, there may be loans that deteriorate in an accelerated time frame. 
 Any increases in the provision or ACL would decrease our net income and capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If actual credit losses materially exceed our ACL, we may be required to raise additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and capital.

 The markets in which we operate are subject to the risk of both natural and man-made disasters. 
 Many of the real and personal properties securing our loans are located in California and more generally in the southwestern portion of the United States. Much of California experiences wildfires from time to time that cause significant damage throughout the state. While these wildfires have not significantly damaged our own properties, it is possible that our borrowers may experience losses in the future, which may materially impair their ability to meet the terms of their obligations. California and the southwestern United States are also prone to other natural disasters, including, but not limited to, drought, earthquakes, flooding, and mudslides. In recent years, drought and decreased snowfall in the Rocky Mountains has led to decreased water flow in the Colorado River, from which many areas in the southwest obtain water, including certain of our markets. Persistence of such conditions or additional significant natural or man-made disasters in the state of California or in our other markets could lead to damage or injury to our own properties and/or employees, declines in population in our markets, and increased risk that our borrowers may experience losses or sustained job interruption, which may materially impair their ability to maintain deposits or meet the terms of their loan obligations. Therefore, additional natural disasters, a man-made disaster or a catastrophic event, persistence of detrimental environmental conditions, or a combination of these or other factors, in any of our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Climate change or societal responses to climate change could adversely affect our business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on our customers and vendors. 
 The lack of empirical data surrounding the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change makes it impossible to predict the specific impact climate change may have on our financial condition and results of operations; however, the physical effects of climate change may also impact us. In addition to the risk of more frequent and/or severe natural disasters, climate change can result in longer term shifts in climate patterns such as extreme heat, sea level rise, declining fresh water resources, and more frequent and prolonged drought. The effects of climate change may have a significant effect in our geographic markets, and could disrupt our operations, the operations of our customers or third parties on which we rely, or supply chains generally. These disruptions, including increased regulation and compliance cost for our customers and changes in consumer behaviors, could result in declines in the economic conditions in geographic markets or industries in which our customers operate and impact their ability to repay loans or maintain deposits and could affect the value of real estate and other assets that serve as collateral for loans. 
 Bank regulators have increasingly viewed financial institutions as playing an important role in helping to address climate change, which may result in increased requirements regarding the disclosure and management of climate risks and related lending activities. We may also become subject to new or heightened regulatory requirements related to climate change, such as requirements relating to operational resiliency or stress testing for various climate stress scenarios. New or increased regulations, including potential additional climate-related disclosure requirements, could result in increased compliance costs or capital requirements. Changes in regulations and customer preferences and behaviors could negatively affect our growth or force us to alter our business strategies, including whether and on what terms and conditions we will engage in certain activities or offer certain products or services and which growth industries and customers we pursue. Additionally, our reputation and customer relationships may be damaged due to our practices related to climate change, including our involvement, or our customers involvement, in certain industries or projects associated with causing or exacerbating climate change, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change. Overall, climate change, its effects and the resulting, unknown impact could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Increased scrutiny and evolving expectations from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders with respect to ESG practices may impose additional costs on the Company or expose it to new or additional risks. 
 As a regulated financial institution and a publicly traded company, we are facing increasing scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders related to ESG practices and disclosure. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds, and influential investors are increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to climate risk, hiring practices, the diversity of the workforce, and racial and social justice issues. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our reputation, ability to do business with certain customers and business partners, and stock price. New government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanding mandatory or voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure. ESG-related costs, including with respect to compliance with any additional regulatory or disclosure requirements or expectations, could adversely impact our results of operations.

 The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions have adversely impacted, and could continue to adversely impact, our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our business is dependent on the willingness and ability of our customers to conduct banking and other financial transactions. The ongoing COVID-19 global and national health emergency caused significant disruption in the United States and international economies and financial markets and continues to cause illness, quarantines, reduced attendance at events and reduced travel, reduced commercial and financial activity, and overall economic and financial market instability. 
 While the level of disruption caused by, and the economic impact of, COVID-19 has lessened in 2022, there is no assurance that the pandemic will not worsen again, including as a result of the emergence of new strains of the virus. Any worsening of the pandemic and its effects on the economy could further impact our business, our provision and ACL, and the value of certain assets that we carry on our balance sheet, such as goodwill. Our customers, business partners, and third-party providers, including those who perform critical services for our business, may also be adversely affected. 
 Credit Risks 
 We are highly dependent on real estate and events that negatively impact the real estate market will hurt our business and earnings. 
 A significant portion of our business is located in areas in which economic growth is largely dependent on the real estate market, and a large part of our loan portfolio is secured by or otherwise dependent on real estate. The market for real estate is cyclical and a significant change in the real estate market that resulted in deterioration in the value of collateral or rental or occupancy rates could adversely affect borrowers ability to repay loans. Changes in the real estate market could also affect the value of foreclosed assets. A decline in real estate activity would likely cause a decline in asset and deposit growth and negatively impact our earnings and financial condition. 
 Our loan portfolio contains concentrations in certain business lines or product types that have unique risk characteristics and may expose us to increased lending risks. 
 Our loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial and industrial, residential mortgage, and CRE loans, which contain material concentrations in certain business lines or product types, such as mortgage warehouse, real estate, corporate finance, as well as in specific business sectors such as technology and innovation. These loan concentrations present unique risks and involve specialized underwriting and management as they often involve large loan balances to a single borrower or group of related borrowers. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one commercial loan or one credit relationship may adversely affect us. In addition, based on the nature of lending to these specialty markets, repayment of loans may be dependent upon borrowers receiving additional equity financing or, in some cases, a successful sale to a third party, public offering, or other form of liquidity event. 
 Our commercial and industrial, CRE, and construction and land development loans, are also largely concentrated in selected markets in Arizona, California, and Nevada. As a result of this geographic concentration, deterioration in economic conditions in these markets could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and charge-offs, an increase in problem assets and foreclosures, a decrease in the demand for our products and services or a decrease in the value of real estate and other collateral for loans. Unforeseen adverse events, changes in economic conditions, and changes in regulatory policy affecting borrowers industries or markets could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our credit linked notes do not ensure full protection against credit losses, and as such we could still incur significant credit losses on loans for which risk of loss has been transferred pursuant to these transactions. 
 We have entered into transactions to mitigate exposure to losses on our loan portfolio. These transactions are structured as credit linked notes, which transfer the risk of first losses on covered loans to these note holders. These notes have an aggregate principal amount of 1.0 billion on a 12.0 billion reference pool of warehouse and equity fund resource loans and residential mortgages. Pursuant to these arrangements, in the event of borrower default, the principal balance of the notes will be reduced by the amount of the loss, up to the amount of the aggregate principal of the notes. However, all residual risk over and above the first loss position is retained by us. While current estimates of future credit losses are below the first loss position, no assurances can be given that these losses will not exceed the first loss position and, if credit losses were to exceed the first loss position, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely effected. We may enter into more such transactions in the future.

 We are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we obtain title. 
 Approximately 60 of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 was secured by real estate. In the course of our business, we may foreclose on and take title to real estate, and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation, and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. These costs and claims could be substantial and adversely affect our business and prospects. 
 Strategic Risks 
 Our future success depends on our ability to compete effectively in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market. 
 We face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of different competitors. Our competitors, including money center banks, national and regional commercial banks, community banks, thrift institutions, mutual savings banks, credit unions, finance companies, insurance companies, securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors, money market mutual funds, financial technology companies and other financial institutions, compete with lending and deposit-gathering services offered by us. Increased competition in our markets or our inability to compete effectively may result in reduced loans and deposits or less favorable pricing. 
 In particular, we have experienced intense price and terms competition in some of the lending lines of business and deposits in recent years. Many of these competing institutions have much greater financial and marketing resources than we have. Due to their size and brand recognition, larger competitors can achieve economies of scale and may offer a broader range of products and services or more attractive pricing than us. In addition, some of the financial services organizations with which we compete are not subject to the same degree of regulation as is imposed on bank holding companies and federally insured depository institutions. As a result, these non-bank competitors have certain advantages over us in accessing funding and in providing various services. 
 The banking business in our primary market areas are very competitive, and the level of competition facing us may increase further, which may limit our asset growth and financial results. In particular, our predominate source of revenue is net interest income. Therefore, if we are unable to compete effectively, including sustaining loan and deposit growth at our historical levels, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 The financial services industry also is facing increasing competitive pressure from the introduction of disruptive new technologies such as blockchain and digital payments, often by non-traditional competitors and financial technology companies. Among other things, technology and other changes are allowing customers to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks at one or both ends of the transaction. The elimination of banks as intermediaries for certain transactions, as well as further disruption of traditional bank businesses and products by non-banks, could result in the loss of fee income and deposits and otherwise adversely affect our business and results. 
 Our expansion strategy may not prove to be successful and our market value and profitability may suffer. 
 We continually evaluate expansion through acquisitions of banks and other financial assets and businesses. Like previous acquisitions by us such as the acquisition of AmeriHome in 2021 and DST in 2022, any future acquisitions will be accompanied by risks commonly encountered in such transactions, including, among other things: 
 time and expense incurred while identifying, evaluating and negotiating potential acquisitions and transactions; 
 difficulty in accurately estimating the value of target companies or assets and in evaluating their credit, operations, management, and market risks; 
 potential payment of a premium over book and market values that may cause dilution of our tangible book value or earnings per share; 
 exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company; 
 potential exposure to asset quality issues of the target company; 
 difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel; 
 potential disruption of our ongoing business; 
 failure to retain key personnel at the acquired business; 
 19

 inability of our management to maximize our financial and strategic position by the successful implementation of uniform product offerings and the incorporation of uniform technology into our product offerings and control systems; and 
 failure to realize any expected revenue increases, cost savings, and other projected benefits from an acquisition. 
 We expect that competition for suitable acquisition candidates may be significant. We may compete with other banks or financial service companies with similar acquisition strategies, many of which are larger and have greater financial and other resources. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully identify and acquire suitable acquisition targets on acceptable terms and conditions, or that we will be able to obtain the regulatory approvals needed to complete any such transactions. 
 We cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions. Potential regulatory enforcement actions could also adversely affect our ability to engage in certain acquisition activities. Our inability to overcome the risks inherent in the successful completion and integration of acquisitions could have an adverse effect on the achievement of our business strategy. 
 There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with the introduction or expansion of lines of business or new products and services within existing lines of business. 
 From time to time, we may implement new lines of business, offer new products and services within existing lines of business, or offer existing products or services to new industries, geographies, or market segments. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed or industries are heavily regulated. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove attainable. External factors, such as compliance with laws and regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences or government policies, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business, product or service or the offering of existing products and services to an emerging industry. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 We are pursuing digital payments initiatives which are subject to significant uncertainty and could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results. 
 We are pursuing digital payments initiatives, including our 2022 acquisition of DST, a digital payments platform for the class action legal industry, and implementation of a fully integrated digital banking platform for our customers, including a digital token powered by the TassatPay platform. The digital payments products and services we offer may use or rely on blockchain-based technologies or assets. Use of blockchain-based technologies in payments are a relatively new and unproven technology, and the laws and regulations surrounding them are uncertain and evolving. Blockchain and digital payment technology has drawn significant scrutiny from governments and regulators in multiple jurisdictions and we expect that scrutiny to continue. Any changes in such laws and regulations applicable to, or scrutiny directed at, our products and services may impede or delay the offering of digital payments solutions, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business or results of operations. 
 In addition, market acceptance of digital payments products and services is subject to significant uncertainty. As such, there can be no assurance that digital payments products and services we offer and the technologies we have chosen to implement will be accepted and desired by customers. We do not have significant prior experience with blockchain-based technology, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully integrate and market such digital payments products and services. We also will continue to incur increased costs in connection with these efforts, and our investments may not be successful. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results. 
 Our success is dependent upon our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees, including members of our leadership and management teams. 
 Our business plan includes and is dependent upon hiring and retaining highly qualified and motivated executives and employees at every level. In particular, our relative success to date has been partly the result of our management s ability to identify and retain highly qualified employees in leadership and administrative support roles, and experienced bankers with expertise in certain specialty areas or that have long-standing relationships in their communities or markets, including with respect to our business-to-business mortgage platform. These professionals bring with them valuable knowledge, specialized skills and expertise, customer relationships and in some cases extensive ties within markets upon which our competitive strategy is based, and have been an integral part of our ability to attract deposits and to expand our market share. We have not

 entered into employment agreements with most of our employees and competition for talent in our industry is intense. The labor market is currently challenging, with employee turnover at an all-time high and increased wage pressure. In addition, the transition to an increased remote work environment, may exacerbate the challenges of attracting and retaining talented and diverse employees as job markets may be less constrained by physical geography. We incentivize employee retention through our equity incentive plans; however, we cannot guarantee the effectiveness of our equity incentive plans in retaining these key employees and executives. Were we to lose key employees, we may not be able to replace them with equally qualified persons who bring the same skills and knowledge of and ties to the communities and markets within which we operate. If we are unable to retain qualified employees or hire new qualified employees to keep up with or outpace employee turnover, we may not be able to successfully execute our business strategy or may incur additional costs to achieve our objectives. 
 We could be harmed if our succession planning is inadequate to mitigate the loss of key members of our senior management team. 
 We believe that our senior management team has contributed greatly to our performance. In addition, we from time to time experience retirements and other changes to our senior management team. Our future performance depends on a smooth transition of our senior management, including finding and training highly qualified replacements who are properly equipped to lead us. We have adopted retention strategies, including equity awards, from which our senior management team benefits in order to achieve our goals. However, we cannot assure our succession planning and retention strategies will be effective and the loss of senior management could have an adverse effect on our business. 
 Capital and Liquidity Risks 
 We are subject to capital adequacy standards and liquidity rules, and a failure to meet these standards could adversely affect our financial condition. 
 WAL and WAB are each subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rules and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital that must be maintained. From time to time, the regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines. If we fail to meet these minimum capital and liquidity guidelines and other regulatory requirements, we may be restricted in the types of activities we may conduct and may be prohibited from taking certain capital actions, such as paying executive bonuses or dividends and repurchasing or redeeming capital securities. At December 31, 2022, our CET1 ratio was 9.3 . While this ratio is above the well-capitalized regulatory ratio threshold of 6.5 , it is still below our targeted capital level. As we continue to focus on building our capital ratios, we may need to issue additional equity capital or reduce the pace at which we are growing in order to increase our CET1 and other capital ratios. 
 If we lose a significant portion of our core deposits or a significant deposit relationship, or our cost of funding deposits increases significantly, our liquidity and/or profitability would be adversely impacted. 
 Our success depends on our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations and support loan growth and, specifically, to attract and retain a stable base of relatively low-cost deposits. The competition for these deposits in our markets is strong and customers may demand higher interest rates on their deposits or seek other investments offering higher rates of return. Additionally, we may accept brokered deposits, which may be more price sensitive than other types of deposits and may become less available if alternative investments offer higher returns. We offer reciprocal deposit products through third party networks to customers seeking federal insurance for deposit amounts that exceed the applicable deposit insurance limit at a single institution. We also from time to time offer other credit enhancements to depositors, such as FHLB letters of credit and, for certain deposits of public monies, pledges of collateral in the form of readily marketable securities. Any event or circumstance that interferes with or limits our ability to offer these products to customers that require greater security for their deposits, such as a significant regulatory enforcement action or a significant decline in capital levels at our bank subsidiary, could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain deposits. If we were to lose a significant deposit relationship or a significant portion of our low-cost deposits, we would be required to borrow from other sources at higher rates and our liquidity and profitability would be adversely impacted. 
 We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify investors under certain circumstances. 
 A substantial portion of our mortgage banking operations involves the sale of loans to third parties, including through securitization. When loans are sold or securitized, we make customary representations and warranties about such loans to the loan purchaser or through documents governing our securitized loan pools. If a mortgage loan does not comply with the representations and warranties made with respect to it at the time of its sale, we could be required to repurchase the loan, replace it with a substitute loan and/or indemnify secondary market purchasers or investors for losses, and may not have recourse to the correspondent seller that sold the mortgage loans and breached similar or other representations and warranties. Significant indemnification or repurchase activity on securitized or sold loans without offsetting recourse to a counterparty from which the loan was purchased could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

 We utilize borrowings from the FHLB and the FRB, and there can be no assurance these programs will be available as needed. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we have 4.3 billion of borrowings from the FHLB of San Francisco and no borrowings from the FRB. We utilize borrowings from the FHLB of San Francisco and the FRB to satisfy short-term liquidity needs. Our borrowing capacity is generally dependent on the value of our collateral pledged to these entities. These lenders could reduce our borrowing capacity or eliminate certain types of collateral and could otherwise modify or terminate their loan programs. Any change to or termination of these programs could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and profitability. 
 A change in our creditworthiness could increase our cost of funding or adversely affect our liquidity. 
 Market participants regularly evaluate our creditworthiness and the creditworthiness of our long-term debt based on a number of factors, some of which are not entirely within our control, including our financial strength and conditions within the financial services industry generally. There can be no assurance that our perceived creditworthiness will remain the same. Changes could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and our access to the capital markets, and could increase our cost of capital. Likewise, any loss of or decline in the credit rating assigned to us could impair our ability to attract deposits or to obtain other funding sources, or increase our cost of funding. 
 Operational and Technological Risks 
 A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs, and cause losses. 
 Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information. Moreover, a portion of our employees work remotely at least some of the time. Although we take numerous protective measures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and security of our customers information across all geographies and product lines, and endeavor to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant, the nature of cyber threats continues to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software, and networks and those of our customers and third-party vendors may be vulnerable to unauthorized payments and account access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber-attacks, and other events that could have an adverse security impact and result in significant losses to us and/or our customers. These threats may originate externally from increasingly sophisticated third parties, including foreign governments, organized criminal groups, and other hackers, or from outsourced or infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or the threats may originate from within our organization. 
 We also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination, or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including vendors, exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses, or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source or cause of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems, data or infrastructure. In addition, we may be at risk of an operational failure with respect to our customers systems. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the outsourcing of many of our business operations, and the continued uncertain global economic environment. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. 
 We maintain insurance policies that we believe provide reasonable coverage for an institution of our size and scope with similar technological systems. However, we cannot assure that these policies will afford coverage for all possible losses or would be sufficient to cover all financial losses, damages, or penalties, including lost revenues, should we experience any one or more of our or a third party s systems failing or experiencing an attack. 
 We rely on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure. 
 We rely on third parties to provide key components for our business operations, such as data processing and storage, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, internet connections, and network access. While we have a robust due diligence process in place to select third-party vendors, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason, or poor performance by a vendor could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also impact our operations if those difficulties interfere with their ability to serve us. Replacing third-party vendors could create significant delays and expense and there is no guarantee that such replacement vendors will be available at

 comparable rates, on similar terms, or in a timely manner, if at all. Any of these things could adversely affect our business and financial performance. 
 Our business may be adversely affected by fraud. 
 As a financial institution, we are inherently exposed to a wide range of operational risks, including, but not limited to, theft and other fraudulent activity by employees, customers, and other third parties targeting us and/or our customers or data. Such activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. 
 Although we devote substantial resources to maintaining effective policies and internal controls to identify and prevent such incidents, given the persistence and increasing sophistication of possible perpetrators, we may experience financial losses or reputational harm as a result of fraud. 
 Our controls and processes, our reporting systems and procedures, and our operational infrastructure may not be able to keep pace with our growth, which could cause us to experience compliance and operational problems, to lose customers, or incur additional expenditures, any one of which could adversely affect our financial results. 
 Our future success will depend on the ability of officers and other key employees to effectively implement solutions designed to continually enhance operational, credit, financial, management and other internal risk controls and processes, as well as improve reporting systems and procedures, while at the same time maintaining and growing existing businesses and client relationships. We may not successfully implement such changes or improvements in an efficient or timely manner, or we may discover deficiencies in our existing systems and controls that adversely affect our ability to support and grow our existing businesses and client relationships, and could require us to incur additional expenditures to expand our administrative and operational infrastructure. If we are unable to maintain and implement improvements to our controls, processes, and reporting systems and procedures, we may lose customers, experience compliance and operational problems or incur additional expenditures beyond current projections, any one of which could adversely affect our financial results. 
 The replacement of LIBOR may adversely affect our business. 
 LIBOR and certain other interest rate benchmarks are the subject of national, international and other regulatory guidance and reform. Effective January 1, 2022, the administrator of the LIBOR ceased the publication of one-week and two-month US dollar LIBOR and will cease the publications of the remaining tenors of US dollar LIBOR (one, three, six, and 12-month) immediately after June 30, 2023. 
 The market transition away from LIBOR to alternative reference rates is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, the transition could: 
 adversely affect the interest rates received or paid on the value of our LIBOR-based assets and liabilities compared to the rate received or paid based on the alternative benchmark rates; 
 adversely affect the interest rates received or paid on the value of other securities or financial arrangements, given LIBOR's role in determining market interest rates globally; 
 prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of our preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate; and 
 result in disputes, litigation or other actions with borrowers or counterparties about the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based contracts and securities. 
 The transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate or rates has required the transition to or development of appropriate systems, models and analytics to effectively transition our risk management and other processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative reference rate. Accordingly, management s LIBOR transition team is actively working on the LIBOR transition project. During the second half of 2021, we began offering three alternative rate indices (including Ameribor, SOFR, and BSBY) on our lending products, with Ameribor as our preferred rate index and, as of December 31, 2021, we are no longer originating new loans using any LIBOR index. Despite these efforts, the manner and impact of this transition and related developments, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, investment and trading securities portfolios, and business, is uncertain and could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.

 Our risk management practices may prove to be inadequate or ineffective. 
 Our risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. We have established policies and procedures intended to identify, monitor, and manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including, but not limited to credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and reputational risk. A BOD level risk committee approves and reviews our key risk management policies and oversees operation of our risk management framework. Although we have devoted significant resources to developing our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future, these policies and procedures, as well as our risk management techniques, may be ineffective. In addition, as regulations and the markets in which we operate continue to evolve, our risk management framework may not keep sufficient pace with those changes. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate significant or material risks, we could suffer unexpected losses or other material adverse impacts. Management of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and/or forecasting models. If the models we use to mitigate these risks are inadequate, or are subject to ineffective governance, we may incur increased losses. In addition, there may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified, or mitigated. 
 Our internal controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented and the accuracy of judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters may impact operating results and financial condition. 
 Our management regularly reviews and updates internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of controls and procedures, or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures, could result in materially inaccurate reported financial statements and/or have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Similarly, our management makes certain estimates and judgments in preparing financial statements. The quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will impact operating results and financial condition. 
 If we are unable to understand and adapt to technological change and implement new technology-driven products and services, our business could be adversely affected. 
 The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. We expect that new technologies will continue to emerge and may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies currently used in our products and services. Our future success depends in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations. Many of our competitors, because of their larger size and available capital, have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. Developing or acquiring new technologies and incorporating them into our products and services may require significant investment, take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. We cannot predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted or how those technologies may be regulated. We also may not be able to effectively market new technology-driven products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Legal and Compliance Risks 
 We operate in a highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation, and accounting principles, or changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, may adversely affect us. 
 We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and legislation that govern almost all aspects of our operations. Intended to protect customers, depositors, and the DIF, these laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on the business activities in which we can engage, require monitoring and reporting of suspicious activity and of customers who are perceived to present a heightened risk of money laundering or other illegal activity, limit the dividends or distributions that WAB can pay to WAL or that we can pay to our stockholders, restrict the ability of affiliates to guarantee our debt, impose certain specific accounting requirements on us that may be more restrictive and result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than does GAAP, among other things. Our mortgage warehouse lending operations subject us to regulations that have grown in complexity in recent years and may continue to do so as the government continues to prioritize consumer protection measures. Our mortgage warehouse lending operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and judicial and administrative decisions, including those designed to discourage predatory lending and regulate collections and servicing practices with respect to mortgage loans.

 Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose significant additional compliance costs. To the extent we continue to grow and become more complex, regulatory oversight and risk and the cost of compliance will likely increase, which may adversely affect us. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Supervision and Regulation included in this Form 10-K for a more detailed summary of the regulations and supervision to which we are subject. 
 Changes to the legal and regulatory framework governing our operations, including the passage and continued implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and EGRRCPA, have drastically revised the laws and regulations under which we operate. In general, bank regulators have increased their focus on risk management and regulatory compliance, and we expect this focus to continue. Additional compliance requirements may be costly to implement, may require additional compliance personnel, and may limit our ability to offer competitive products to our customers. 
 We are also subject to changes in federal and state law, as well as regulations and governmental policies, income tax laws, and accounting principles. Regulations affecting banks and other financial institutions are undergoing continuous review and frequently change, and the ultimate effect of such changes cannot be predicted. Regulations and laws may be modified at any time, and new legislation may be enacted that will affect us, WAB, and our other subsidiaries. Any changes in federal and state law, as well as regulations and governmental policies, income tax laws, and accounting principles, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including ways that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Failure to appropriately comply with any such laws, regulations or principles or an alleged failure to comply, even if we acted in good faith or the alleged failure reflects a difference in interpretation, could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties or damage to our reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 State and federal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which we are or become subject as a result of such examinations may adversely affect us. 
 State and federal banking agencies, including the FRB, FDIC, and CFPB, periodically conduct examinations of our business, including for compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a federal agency were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we or our management was in violation of any law or regulation, the agency may take a number of different remedial or enforcement actions it deems appropriate to remedy such a deficiency. These actions include the power to enjoin unsafe or unsound practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, and to assess civil monetary penalties against us and/or officers or directors, and to remove officers and directors. If the FDIC concludes that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, it may terminate WAB s deposit insurance. Under Arizona law, the state banking supervisory authority has many of the same enforcement powers with respect to our state-chartered bank. The CFPB also has the authority to examine us and to take enforcement actions, including the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or civil monetary penalties against us if it finds that we offer consumer financial products and services in violation of federal consumer financial protection laws or in an unfair, deceptive, or abusive manner. Finally, our AmeriHome subsidiary needs to maintain certain state licenses and federal and government-sponsored agency approvals required to conduct its business and is subject to periodic examinations by such state and federal agencies, which can result in increases in administrative costs, substantial penalties due to compliance errors, or the loss of licenses. 
 If we were unable to comply with regulatory directives in the future, or if we were unable to comply with the terms of any future supervisory requirements to which we may become subject, then we could become subject to a variety of supervisory actions and orders, including cease and desist orders, prompt corrective actions, MOUs, and/or other regulatory enforcement actions. If our regulators were to take such supervisory actions, then we could, among other things, become subject to restrictions on our ability to enter into acquisitions and develop any new business, as well as restrictions on our existing business. We also could be required to raise additional capital, dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time, or both. Failure to implement the measures in the time frames provided, or at all, could result in additional orders or penalties from federal and state regulators, which could result in one or more of the remedial actions described above. In the event we were ultimately unable to comply with the terms of a regulatory enforcement action, we could fail and be placed into receivership by the FDIC or the chartering agency. The terms of any such supervisory action and the consequences associated with any failure to comply therewith could have a material negative effect on our business, operating flexibility, and financial condition.

 Current and proposed regulations addressing consumer privacy and data use and security could increase our costs and impact our reputation. 
 We are subject to federal, state and local laws related to consumer privacy and data use and security, including information safeguard rules under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the California Consumer Protection Act. These rules require that financial institutions develop, implement, and maintain a written, comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution s size and complexity, the nature and scope of the financial institution s activities, and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue. The United States has experienced a heightened legislative and regulatory focus on privacy and data security, including requirements as to consumer notification in the event of data breaches and certain types of security breaches. Additional regulations in these areas may increase compliance costs, which could negatively impact earnings. In addition, failure to comply with the privacy, data use and security laws and regulations to which we are subject, including by reason of inadvertent disclosure of confidential information, could result in fines, sanctions, penalties, reputational harm, loss of consumer confidence, and other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business. 
 We could be subject to adverse changes or interpretations of tax laws, tax audits, or challenges to our tax positions. 
 We are subject to federal and applicable state income tax laws and regulations. Income tax laws and regulations are often complex and require significant judgment in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. Changes in tax laws, changes in interpretations, guidance or regulations that may be promulgated, or challenges to judgments or actions that we may take with respect to tax laws could negatively impact our current and future financial performance. In August 2022, the IRA was signed into law. The IRA, among other provisions, imposes a 15 book minimum tax on corporations with three-year average annual adjusted financial statement income exceeding 1 billion and a 1 excise tax on corporate stock repurchases after December 31, 2022. We are currently assessing the potential impact of these legislative changes and will continue to evaluate the overall impact of other current, future and proposed regulations and interpretive guidance from tax authorities on our effective tax rate and consolidated balance sheets. 
 In addition, our determination of our tax liability is subject to review by applicable tax authorities. In the normal course of business, we are routinely subject to examinations and challenges from federal and applicable state and local taxing authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in connection with investments we have made and the businesses in which we have engaged. Recently, federal and state and local taxing authorities have been increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions. The challenges made by taxing authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. Any such challenges that are not resolved in our favor may adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments or financial condition. 
 Securities-Related Risks 
 The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future. 
 The price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange constantly changes. There can be no assurances about the market price for our common stock. 
 Our stock price may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control. These factors include: 
 actual or anticipated changes in the political climate or public policy; 
 sales of our equity securities; 
 our financial condition, performance, creditworthiness, and prospects; 
 quarterly variations in our operating results or the quality of our assets; 
 operating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts, and investors; 
 changes in expectations as to our future financial performance; 
 announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions, and other material events by us or our competitors; 
 the operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to us; 
 the credit, mortgage, and housing markets, the markets for securities relating to mortgages or housing, and developments with respect to financial institutions generally; 
 changes in interest rates and the slope of the yield curve; 
 changes in national and global financial markets and economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, inflation, stock, commodity or real estate valuations or volatility and other global, geopolitical,

 regulatory or judicial events that effect the financial markets and economy including pandemics, terrorism and war, including the military conflict between Russia and the Ukraine; and 
 our past and future dividend and share repurchase practices. 
 
 There may be future sales or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock or depositary shares representing preferred stock. 
 We are not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. We also grant a significant number of shares of common stock to employees and directors under our Incentive Plan each year. The issuance of any additional shares of our common stock, depositary shares, or preferred stock or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or that represent the right to receive common stock, or the exercise of such securities could be substantially dilutive to stockholders of our common stock. Holders of our common stock, depositary shares, and preferred stock have no preemptive rights that entitle such holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series. Because our decision to issue securities in the future will depend on market conditions, our acquisition activity, and other factors, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of our future offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their stock holdings in us. 
 There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock as we have in the past. 
 We have paid regular quarterly dividends on our common stock since the third quarter of 2019, subject to quarterly declarations by the BOD, and also have paid dividends on our depositary shares representing our preferred stock since the issuance of such securities in the third quarter of 2021. We have previously adopted common stock repurchase programs, pursuant to which we have repurchased shares of our outstanding common stock, the most recent of which expired in December 2020. 
 
 Our dividend payments and/or stock repurchase practices may change from time-to-time, and no assurance can be provided that we will continue to declare dividends in any particular amounts or at all, or institute a new stock repurchase program. Dividends and/or stock repurchases are subject to capital availability and the discretion of our BOD, which must evaluate, among other things, whether cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all applicable laws and any agreements containing provisions that limit our ability to declare and pay cash dividends and/or repurchase stock. Furthermore, our outstanding Series A preferred stock is senior to our common stock and could adversely affect the ability of us to declare or pay dividends or distributions on common stock. Under the terms of the Series A preferred stock, we are prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock unless all dividends for the latest dividend period on all outstanding shares of Series A preferred stock have been declared and paid in full or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of those dividends has been set aside. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments or dividend program could have a negative effect on our stock price. 
 Offerings of debt, which would be senior to our common stock upon liquidation, and/or preferred equity securities that may be senior to our common stock for purposes of dividend distributions or upon liquidation, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
 We may from time to time issue debt securities, borrow money through other means, or issue preferred stock. We may also borrow money from the FRB, the FHLB, other financial institutions, and other lenders. At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding subordinated debt, senior secured and unsecured debt, and short-term borrowings. In addition, AmeriHome has outstanding senior notes that were issued prior to the acquisition. We also have outstanding depositary shares representing Series A preferred stock, which is senior to our common stock. All of these securities or borrowings have priority over our common stock in a liquidation, which could affect the market price of our stock. 
 Our BOD is authorized to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock from time to time without any action on the part of the stockholders. Our BOD also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, and preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or upon our dissolution, winding-up, and liquidation and other terms. If we issue additional preferred stock in the future that has a preference over our common stock, with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock and/or the rights of holders of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.

 Anti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our stockholders. 
 Provisions of Delaware law and provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and our Amended and Restated Bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. Additionally, our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, authorizes our BOD to issue additional series of preferred stock and such preferred stock could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal. These provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders.

 As a bank holding company, management focuses on key ratios in evaluating the Company's financial condition and results of operations. 
 Results of Operations and Financial Condition 
 A summary of the Company's results of operations, financial condition, and selected metrics are included in the following tables:

 Asset Quality 
 For all banks and bank holding companies, asset quality plays a significant role in the overall financial condition of the institution and results of operations. The Company measures asset quality in terms of nonaccrual loans as a percentage of gross loans and net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans. Net charge-offs are calculated as the difference between charged-off loans and recovery payments received on previously charged-off loans. The following table summarizes the Company's key asset quality metrics for loans HFI: 
 At or for the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (dollars in millions) Nonaccrual loans 85 73 115 Repossessed assets 11 12 1 Non-performing assets 98 87 150 Nonaccrual loans to funded loans 0.16 0.19 0.43 Nonaccrual and repossessed assets to total assets 0.14 0.15 0.32 Allowance for loan losses to funded loans 0.60 0.65 1.03 Allowance for credit losses to funded loans 0.69 0.74 1.17 Allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans 364 348 242 Allowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans 419 400 274 Net charge-offs to average loans outstanding 0.00 0.02 0.06

 Asset and Deposit Growth 
 The Company s assets and liabilities are comprised primarily of loans and deposits. Therefore, the ability to originate new loans and attract new deposits is fundamental to the Company s growth. 
 Total assets increased to 67.7 billion at December 31, 2022 from 56.0 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase in total assets of 11.7 billion, or 20.9 , was driven by continued organic loan and deposit growth. loans HFI increased by 12.8 billion, or 32.7 , to 51.9 billion as of December 31, 2022, compared to 39.1 billion as of December 31, 2021. The increase in loans HFI from December 31, 2021 was driven by increases of 6.6 billion in residential real estate (including EBO loans transferred from HFS to HFI in 2022 with a 1.9 billion balance at December 31, 2022), 2.8 billion in CRE, non-owner occupied, 2.4 billion in commercial and industrial, and 990 million in construction and land development loans. This increase in loans HFI was partially offset by a decrease in loans HFS of 4.5 billion from 5.6 billion as of December 31, 2021. The decrease in loans HFS was attributable to sales, a decline in production volumes, and transfer of the remaining EBO loan balance to HFI during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Total deposits increased 6.0 billion, or 12.7 , to 53.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 from 47.6 billion as of December 31, 2021. The increase in deposits from December 31, 2021 was driven by increases of 3.0 billion in certificates of deposits, 2.6 billion of interest bearing demand deposits, and 2.1 billion in savings and money market accounts, partially offset by a decrease of 1.7 billion in non-interest bearing demand deposits. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following table sets forth a summary financial overview: 
 Year Ended December 31, Increase 2022 2021 (Decrease) (in millions, except per share amounts) Consolidated Income Statement Data: Interest income 2,691.8 1,658.7 1,033.1 Interest expense 475.5 109.9 365.6 Net interest income 2,216.3 1,548.8 667.5 Provision for (recovery of) credit losses 68.1 (21.4) 89.5 Net interest income after provision for (recovery of) credit losses 2,148.2 1,570.2 578.0 Non-interest income 324.6 404.2 (79.6) Non-interest expense 1,156.7 851.4 305.3 Income before provision for income taxes 1,316.1 1,123.0 193.1 Income tax expense 258.8 223.8 35.0 Net income 1,057.3 899.2 158.1 Dividends on preferred stock 12.8 3.5 9.3 Net income available to common stockholders 1,044.5 895.7 148.8 Earnings per share: Basic 9.74 8.72 1.02 Diluted 9.70 8.67 1.03

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The following discussion and analysis contains financial information determined by methods other than those prescribed by GAAP. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in their analysis of the Company's performance. Management believes presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a complete understanding of the operating results of the Company. Since the presentation of these non-GAAP performance measures and their impact differ between companies, these non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. 
 Pre-Provision Net Revenue 
 Banking regulations define PPNR as the sum of net interest income and non-interest income less expenses before adjusting for loss provisions. Management believes that this is an important metric as it illustrates the underlying performance of the Company, it enables investors and others to assess the Company's ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through the credit cycle, and provides consistent reporting with a key metric used by bank regulatory agencies. 
 The following table shows the components used in the calculation of PPNR: 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (in millions) Net interest income 2,216.3 1,548.8 1,166.9 Total non-interest income 324.6 404.2 70.8 Net revenue 2,540.9 1,953.0 1,237.7 Total non-interest expense 1,156.7 851.4 491.6 Pre-provision net revenue 1,384.2 1,101.6 746.1 Less: Provision for (recovery of) credit losses 68.1 (21.4) 123.6 Income tax expense 258.8 223.8 115.9 Net income 1,057.3 899.2 506.6 
 Efficiency Ratio 
 The following table shows the components used in the calculation of the efficiency ratio, which management uses as a metric for assessing cost efficiency: 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (dollars in millions) Total non-interest expense 1,156.7 851.4 491.6 Divided by: Total net interest income 2,216.3 1,548.8 1,166.9 Plus: Tax equivalent interest adjustment 33.7 33.3 28.4 Total non-interest income 324.6 404.2 70.8 2,574.6 1,986.3 1,266.1 Efficiency ratio - tax equivalent basis 44.9 42.9 38.8

 Tangible Common Equity and Return on Average Tangible Common Equity 
 The following tables present financial measures related to tangible common equity. Tangible common equity represents total stockholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets and preferred stock. Management believes that tangible common equity financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's capital strength, financial condition, and ability to manage potential losses. 
 December 31, 2022 2021 (dollars and shares in millions) Total stockholders' equity 5,356 4,963 Less: Goodwill and intangible assets 680 635 Preferred stock 295 295 Total tangible common stockholders' equity 4,381 4,033 Plus: deferred tax - attributed to intangible assets 2 2 Total tangible common equity, net of tax 4,383 4,035 Total assets 67,734 55,983 Less: goodwill and intangible assets, net 680 635 Tangible assets 67,054 55,348 Plus: deferred tax - attributed to intangible assets 2 2 Total tangible assets, net of tax 67,056 55,350 Tangible common equity ratio 6.5 7.3 Common shares outstanding 108.9 106.6 Book value per common share 46.47 43.78 Tangible book value per common share, net of tax 40.25 37.84

 Regulatory Capital 
 The following table presents certain financial measures related to regulatory capital under Basel III, which includes CET 1 and total capital. The FRB and other banking regulators use CET1 and total capital as a basis for assessing a bank's capital adequacy; therefore, management believes it is useful to assess financial condition and capital adequacy using this same basis. Specifically, the total capital ratio takes into consideration the risk levels of assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments. In addition, management believes that the classified assets to CET1 plus allowance measure is an important regulatory metric for assessing asset quality. 
 As permitted by the regulatory capital rules, the Company elected to delay the estimated impact of CECL on its regulatory capital over a five-year transition period ending December 31, 2024. Beginning in 2022, capital ratios and amounts include a 25 reduction to the capital benefit that resulted from the increased ACL related to the adoption of ASC 326.

 Net Interest Margin 
 The net interest margin is reported on a TEB. A tax equivalent adjustment is added to reflect interest earned on certain securities and loans that are exempt from federal and state income tax.

 Comparison of interest income, interest expense and net interest margin 
 The Company's primary source of revenue is interest income. For the year ended December 31, 2022, interest income was 2.7 billion, an increase of 1.0 billion, or 62.3 , compared to 1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily the result of a 898.7 million increase in interest income from loans HFI that was driven by a 16.2 billion increase in the average HFI loan balance for the year ended December 31, 2022 and to a lesser extent higher rates. Interest income from investment securities also increased by 107.9 million for the comparable period due to increased investment yields driven by a higher rate environment and investment securities mix as the Company held a higher proportion of variable rate securities in 2022 compared to 2021. Average yield on interest earning assets increased to 4.45 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 3.65 for 2021, which was primarily the result of a higher rate environment. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, interest expense was 475.5 million, compared to 109.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Interest expense on deposits increased 228.9 million for the same period due to increasing deposit rates, coupled with a 7.2 billion increase in average interest-bearing deposits. Interest expense across all debt types increased 136.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 as a result of an increase of 2.9 billion in average total debt. The increase in average total debt during the year ended December 31, 2022 is attributable to increases in overnight borrowings and 579 million of credit linked notes issuances, net of issuance costs. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, net interest income was 2.2 billion, compared to 1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net interest income reflects a 14.9 billion increase in average interest earning assets, partially offset by an increase of 10.1 billion in average interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in net interest margin of 26 basis points compared to 2021 is the result of an increase in average loan balances couple with higher loan and investment security yields due to a rising rate environment, partially offset by higher funding costs on deposits and borrowings during 2022.

 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit losses in each period is reflected as a reduction in earnings for that period and includes amounts related to funded loans, unfunded loan commitments, and investment securities. The provision is equal to the amount required to maintain the ACL at a level that is adequate to absorb estimated lifetime credit losses inherent in the loan and investment securities portfolios based on remaining contractual maturity, adjusted for estimated prepayments as of each period end. The Company's CECL models incorporate historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts in measuring expected credit losses. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 68.1 million, which is primarily attributable to the Company's strong loan growth during the year and to a lesser extent, the current weakened economic outlook. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a recovery of credit losses of 21.4 million due to improvement in economic forecasts relative to 2020. 
 Non-interest Income 
 The following table presents a summary of non-interest income: 
 Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2022 2021 (in millions) Net loan servicing revenue (expense) 130.9 (16.3) 147.2 Net gain on loan origination and sale activities 104.0 326.2 (222.2) Service charges and fees 27.0 28.3 (1.3) Commercial banking related income 21.5 17.4 4.1 Income from equity investments 17.8 22.1 (4.3) Gain on recovery from credit guarantees 14.7 7.2 7.5 Gain on sales of investment securities 6.8 8.3 (1.5) Fair value loss on assets measured at fair value, net (28.6) (1.3) (27.3) Other income 30.5 12.3 18.2 Total non-interest income 324.6 404.2 (79.6) 
 Total non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 decreased by 79.6 million . The decrease in non-interest income was primarily driven by a decrease in net gain on loan origination and sale activities of 222.2 million as the rise in interest rates throughout 2022 impacted the Company's residential mortgage banking business, resulting in compressed margins, a decline in production volume, and reduced gains due to fair value changes. The rising rate environment also contributed to m ark-to-market losses on the Company's equity securities, which was the primary driver of the 27.3 million increase to fair value loss on assets measured at fair value, net . These decreases were partially offset by an increase in net loan servicing revenue of 147.2 million from lower payoffs, gain on sales of MSRs, and higher servicing fees.

 Non-interest Expense 
 The following table presents a summary of non-interest expense: 
 Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2022 2021 (in millions) Salaries and employee benefits 539.5 466.7 72.8 Deposit costs 165.8 29.8 136.0 Legal, professional, and directors' fees 99.9 58.6 41.3 Data processing 83.0 58.2 24.8 Loan servicing expenses 55.5 53.5 2.0 Occupancy 55.5 43.8 11.7 Insurance 31.1 23.0 8.1 Loan acquisition and origination expenses 23.1 28.8 (5.7) Business development and marketing 22.1 13.5 8.6 Net gain on sales and valuations of repossessed and other assets (0.7) (3.5) 2.8 Acquisition and restructure expenses 0.4 15.3 (14.9) Loss on extinguishment of debt 5.9 (5.9) Other expense 81.5 57.8 23.7 Total non-interest expense 1,156.7 851.4 305.3 
 Total non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 305.3 million compared to the same period in 2021. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily driven by increases in deposit costs, salaries and employee benefits, legal, professional, and directors' fees, and data processing costs. The increase in deposits costs of 136.0 million primarily relates to higher earnings credit rates as a result of the rising rate environment in 2022. Salaries and employee benefits increased 72.8 million due to an increase in headcount from the prior year to support the Company's continued growth, higher incentive compensation from loan and deposit growth during the year, and inclusion of a full year of compensation costs in 2022 for AmeriHome employees. The increase in legal, professional, and directors' fees of 41.3 million relates to an increase in project initiatives and consulting work to support ongoing implementations and the increase in data processing costs of 24.8 million was driven by an increase in software licensing costs. 
 Income Taxes 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company's effective tax rate was 19.7 and 19.9 , respectively. There was not a significant change in the effective tax rate from 2021 to 2022.

 BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 
 Total assets increased to 67.7 billion at December 31, 2022 from 56.0 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase in total assets of 11.7 billion, or 20.9 , was driven by continued organic loan and deposit growth. Loans HFI increased by 12.8 billion, or 32.7 , to 51.9 billion as of December 31, 2022, compared to 39.1 billion as of December 31, 2021. The increase in loans HFI from December 31, 2021 was driven by increases in residential real estate loans of 6.6 billion (including EBO loans transferred from HFS to HFI in 2022 with a 1.9 billion balance at December 31, 2022), CRE, non-owner occupied loans of 2.8 billion, commercial and industrial loans of 2.4 billion, and construction and land development loans of 990 million. In addition, loans HFS decreased 4.5 billion, down from 5.6 billion as of December 31, 2021, related to sales, a decline in production volumes, and transfer of the remaining EBO loan balance to loans HFI during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Total liabilities increased 11.4 billion, or 22.3 , to 62.4 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to 51.0 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase in liabilities is due primarily to an increase in total deposits and borrowings. Total deposits increased 6.0 billion, or 12.7 , to 53.6 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase in deposits from December 31, 2021 was driven by increases in certificates of deposit of 3.0 billion, interest-bearing demand deposits of 2.6 billion, and savings and money market accounts of 2.1 billion, partially offset by a decrease in non-interest-bearing demand deposits of 1.7 billion. Other borrowings also increased 4.8 billion due to an increase in overnight borrowings and issuance of credit linked notes during the year. 
 Total stockholders equity increased by 393 million, or 7.9 , to 5.4 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to 5.0 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase in stockholders' equity is primarily a function of net income and net proceeds of 157.7 million from issuance of common stock during the year, offset by quarterly dividends to common and preferred shareholders and unrealized fair value losses on AFS securities recorded net of tax in other comprehensive income.

 Investment securities 
 Debt securities are classified at the time of acquisition as either HTM, AFS, or trading based upon various factors, including asset/liability management strategies, liquidity and profitability objectives, and regulatory requirements. HTM securities are carried at amortized cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts. AFS securities are debt securities that may be sold prior to maturity based upon asset/liability management decisions. Investment securities classified as AFS are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses on these securities recorded in AOCI in stockholders equity, net of tax. Amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts on MBS is periodically adjusted for estimated prepayments. Trading securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses on these securities included in current period earnings. 
 The Company's investment securities portfolio is utilized as collateral for borrowings, required collateral for public deposits and repurchase agreements, and to manage liquidity, capital, and interest rate risk. 
 The following table summarizes the carrying value of the Company's investment securities portfolio: 
 December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2022 2021 (in millions) Debt securities CLO 2,706 926 1,780 Commercial MBS issued by GSEs 97 69 28 Corporate debt securities 390 383 7 Private label residential MBS 1,397 1,725 (328) Residential MBS issued by GSEs 1,740 1,993 (253) Tax-exempt 1,982 2,105 (123) U.S. treasury securities 13 (13) Other 69 82 (13) Total debt securities 8,381 7,296 1,085 Equity securities Common stock 3 3 CRA investments 49 45 4 Preferred stock 108 114 (6) Total equity securities 160 159 1 
 The carrying value of debt securities increased 1.1 billion, or 14.9 , from December 31, 2021. The increase in investment securities is largely attributable to purchases of CLOs, offset by paydowns and unrealized fair value losses. The Company continued to increase its investment in CLOs during 2022 as these variable rate securities generate yields that are higher than those for MBS and benefited from the rising rate environment. The Company's CLO portfolio consists of second or third credit tranche bonds of structured transactions, rated AA to A. The rates on these securities will convert to a SOFR index when LIBOR is discontinued in June 2023.

 The weighted average yield on investment securities is calculated by dividing income within each maturity range by the outstanding amount of the related investment. For purposes of calculating the weighted average yield, AFS securities are carried at amortized cost in the table below and tax-exempt obligations have not been tax-effected. The maturity distribution and weighted average yield of the Company's investment security portfolios at December 31, 2022 are summarized in the table below:

 (1) MBS are comprised of pools of loans with varying maturities, the majority of which are due after 10 years. 
 The Company does not hold any subprime MBS in its investment portfolio. Approximately 58 of its MBS are GSE issued. The MBS that are not GSE issued consist primarily of investment grade securities, including 1.2 billion rated AAA and 41 million rated AA. 
 Gross unrealized losses on the Company's AFS securities at December 31, 2022 relate primarily to changes in interest rates and other market conditions that are not considered to be credit-related issues. The Company has reviewed its securities on which there is an unrealized loss in accordance with its ACL policy described in "Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Based on the analysis performed, management determined that an ACL on the Company's AFS securities was not necessary at December 31, 2022. 
 The credit loss model under ASC 326-20, applicable to HTM securities, requires recognition of lifetime expected credit losses through an allowance account at the time the security is purchased. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized no provision for credit losses on HTM securities, compared to a recovery of credit losses of 1.6 million for the same period in 2021, resulting in a total allowance of 5.2 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

 Loans HFS 
 The Company purchases and originates residential mortgage loans through its AmeriHome mortgage banking business channel that are held for sale or securitization. At December 31, 2022, the Company had 1.2 billion of loans HFS, compared to 5.6 billion at December 31, 2021. The decrease in loans HFS from December 31, 2021 relates to sales, a decline in production volumes, and transfer of the remaining EBO loan balance to loans HFI.

 Loans classified as HFI are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, adjusted for net deferred fees and costs, premiums and discounts on acquired and purchased loans, and an ACL. Net deferred loan fees of 141 million and 86 million reduced the carrying value of loans as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net unamortized purchase premiums on acquired and purchased loans of 195 million and 185 million increased the carrying value of loans as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

 As of December 31, 2022, approximately 21.6 billion, or 74.5 , of total variable rate loans were subject to rate floors with a weighted average interest rate of 4.1 . At December 31, 2021, approximately 18.3 billion, or 74.3 of total variable rate loans were subject to rate floors with a weighted average interest rate of 4.0 . At December 31, 2022, total loans consisted of 55.9 with variable rates and 44.1 with fixed rates, compared to 63.0 with variable rates and 37.0 with fixed rates at December 31, 2021. 
 The Company began offering three alternative rate indices (including Ameribor, SOFR, and BSBY) on its lending products to its customers in the second half of 2021, with Ameribor as its preferred rate index. Existing variable rate loan contracts contain LIBOR replacement language, which allow for conversion to a different rate index and spread adjustment, if necessary.

 The Company monitors concentrations of lending activities at the product and borrower relationship level. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, no borrower relationships at both the commitment and funded loan level exceeded 5 of total loans HFI. 
 Commercial and industrial loans made up 40 and 47 of the Company's HFI loan portfolio as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 In addition, the Company's loan portfolio includes significant credit exposure to the CRE market as CRE related loans accounted for approximately 29 of total loans at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Approximately 16 and 13 of the Company's CRE investor portfolio consisted of office loans as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These office loans are primarily shorter-term bridge loans that enable borrowers to reposition or redevelop projects and are geographically well diversified, with the vast majority located in midtown or suburban locations. At the time of origination, these loans have an initial loan-to-value ratio of less than 55 and a weighted average loan-to-cost of less than 60 . The properties underlying these loans have stable business trends and low vacancy rates. Substantially all of the Company's remaining CRE loans are secured by first liens with an initial loan-to-value ratio of generally not more than 75 . Approximately 16 and 23 of these CRE loans, excluding construction and land loans, were owner-occupied at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Non-performing Assets 
 Total non-performing loans increased by 11 million at December 31, 2022 to 87 million from 76 million at December 31, 2021.

 Troubled Debt Restructured Loans 
 A TDR loan is a loan on which the Company, for reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that the Company would not otherwise consider. The loan terms that have been modified or restructured due to a borrower s financial situation include, but are not limited to, a reduction in the stated interest rate, an extension of the maturity or renewal of the loan at an interest rate below current market, a reduction in the face amount of the debt, a reduction in the accrued interest, or deferral of interest payments. The majority of the Company's modifications are extensions in terms or deferral of payments which result in no lost principal or interest. Consistent with regulatory guidance, a TDR loan that is subsequently modified in another restructuring agreement but has shown sustained performance and classification as a TDR, will be removed from TDR status provided that the modified terms were market-based at the time of modification. 
 The following table presents TDR loans:

 Mortgage Servicing Rights 
 The fair value of the Company's MSRs related to residential mortgage loans totaled 1.1 billion and 698 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in MSRs is primarily related to new production that was not fully offset by sales of MSRs. 
 The following is a summary of the UPB of loans underlying the Company's MSR portfolio by type: 
 December 31, 2022 2021 (in millions) FNMA and FHLMC 38,113 38,754 GNMA 31,046 14,379 Non-agency 1,690 1,215 Total unpaid principal balance of loans 70,849 54,348

 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
 Goodwill represents the excess consideration paid for net assets acquired in a business combination over their fair value. Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are determined to have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization, but are subsequently evaluated for impairment at least annually. The Company has goodwill totaling 527 million as of December 31, 2022. The increase from 491 million at December 31, 2021 is attributable to the DST acquisition in January 2022. See "Note 2. Mergers, Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Item 8 of this form 10-K for further discussion of the acquisition. 
 The Company performs its annual goodwill and intangibles impairment tests as of October 1 each year, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, there were no events or circumstances that indicated an interim impairment test of goodwill or other intangible assets was necessary. 
 The following is a summary of acquired intangible assets: 
 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount (in millions) Subject to amortization Core deposits 14 11 3 14 10 4 Correspondent customer relationships 76 7 69 76 3 73 Customer relationships 18 3 15 3 1 2 Developed technology 4 1 3 Operating licenses 56 2 54 56 1 55 Trade names 10 1 9 9 0 9 178 25 153 158 15 143 
 Deferred Tax Assets 
 As of December 31, 2022, the net DTA balance totaled 311 million, an increase of 290 million from 21 million as of December 31, 2021. This overall increase in the net DTA was primarily the result of decreases in the fair market value of AFS securities, an increase to expected tax credit carryovers, and an increase to the ACL. 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no deferred tax valuation allowance. 
 Deposits 
 Deposits are the primary source for funding the Company's asset growth. Total deposits increased to 53.6 billion at December 31, 2022 from 47.6 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of 6.0 billion, or 12.7 . By deposit type, the increase in deposits is attributable to increases in certificates of deposit of 3.0 billion, interest-bearing demand deposits of 2.6 billion, and savings and money market accounts of 2.1 billion, partially offset by a decrease in non-interest-bearing demand deposits of 1.7 billion. 
 WAB is a participant in the IntraFi Network, a network that offers deposit placement services such as CDARS and ICS, which offer products that qualify large deposits for FDIC insurance. At December 31, 2022, the Company had 683 million of CDARS deposits and 2.1 billion of ICS deposits, compared to 729 million of CDARS deposits and 1.8 billion of ICS deposits at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company also had wholesale brokered deposits of 4.8 billion and 1.8 billion, respectively. 
 In addition, deposits for which the Company provides account holders with earnings credits or referral fees totaled 13 billion and 11 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company incurred 162.8 million and 27.4 million in deposit related costs on these deposits during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These costs are reported as Deposit costs in non-interest expense. The increase in these costs from the prior year is due to an increase in earnings credit rates as well as an increase in average deposit balances eligible for earnings credits or referral fees.

 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had total uninsured deposits of 29.5 billion and 26.9 billion, respectively. Total U.S. time deposits in excess of the FDIC insurance limit were 1.1 billion and 466 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 The table below discloses the remaining maturity for estimated uninsured time deposits as of December 31, 2022: 
 (in millions) 3 months or less 423 3 to 6 months 378 6 to 12 months 274 Over 12 months 51 Total 1,126 
 Uninsured deposit information presented herein is estimated using the same methodologies utilized for regulatory reporting, where applicable. Specific to uninsured time deposits, the Company made certain assumptions to estimate uninsured amounts by maturity. At the account level, deposit insurance was assumed to apply first to non-time deposits, then any remaining insurance amounts were applied to maturity groupings on a pro-rata basis, based on the depositor's total amount of time deposits. 
 Other Borrowings 
 Short-Term Borrowings 
 The Company utilizes short-term borrowed funds to support short-term liquidity needs generally created by increased loan demand. The majority of these short-term borrowed funds consist of advances from the FHLB, federal funds purchased from correspondent banks or the FHLB, and repurchase agreements. The Company s borrowing capacity with the FHLB is determined based on collateral pledged, generally consisting of securities and loans. In addition, the Company has borrowing capacity from other sources, collateralized by securities, including securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are reflected at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction, and may require additional collateral based on the fair value of the underlying securities. At December 31, 2022, total short-term borrowed funds consisted of FHLB advances of 4.3 billion, federal funds purchased of 640 million, repurchase agreements of 27 million, and secured borrowings of 25 million. At December 31, 2021, total short-term borrowed funds consisted of federal funds purchased of 675 million, secured borrowings of 35 million, and repurchase agreements of 17 million. 
 Long-Term Borrowings 
 The Company's long-term borrowings consist of AmeriHome senior notes from the acquisition on April 7, 2021 and credit linked notes, inclusive of issuance costs and fair market value adjustments. At December 31, 2022, the carrying value of long-term borrowings was 1.3 billion, compared to 775 million at December 31, 2021. The increase in long-term borrowings from December 31, 2021 relates to 2022 credit linked note issuances, totaling 579 million, net of issuance costs. 
 Qualifying Debt 
 Qualifying debt consists of subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt, inclusive of issuance costs and fair market value adjustments. At December 31, 2022, the carrying value of qualifying debt was 893 million, compared to 896 million at December 31, 2021.

 Capital Resources 
 The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could trigger certain mandatory or discretionary actions that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s business and financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items (discussed in "Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K) as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 
 As permitted by the regulatory capital rules, the Company elected the CECL transition option that delays the estimated impact on regulatory capital resulting from the adoption of CECL over a five-year transition period ending December 31, 2024. Beginning in 2022, capital ratios and amounts include a 25 reduction to the capital benefit that resulted from the increased ACL related to the adoption of ASC 326. 
 As a result of the Company's continued commercial loan growth and the acquisition of AmeriHome, the Company continues to undertake various capital actions to ensure that its capital levels remain strong, which during the year ended December 31, 2022, included sales of common stock under the Company's ATM program and three credit linked note issuances. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company and the Bank exceeded the capital levels necessary to be classified as well-capitalized, as defined by the various banking agencies. The actual capital amounts and ratios for the Company and the Bank are presented in the following tables: 
 Total Capital Tier 1 Capital Risk-Weighted Assets Tangible Average Assets Total Capital Ratio Tier 1 Capital Ratio Tier 1 Leverage Ratio Common Equity Tier 1 (dollars in millions) December 31, 2022 WAL 6,586 5,449 54,461 69,814 12.1 10.0 7.8 9.3 WAB 6,280 5,737 54,411 69,762 11.5 10.5 8.2 10.5 Well-capitalized ratios 10.0 8.0 5.0 6.5 Minimum capital ratios 8.0 6.0 4.0 4.5 December 31, 2021 WAL 5,499 4,444 44,697 56,973 12.3 9.9 7.8 9.1 WAB 5,120 4,658 44,726 56,962 11.4 10.4 8.2 10.4 Well-capitalized ratios 10.0 8.0 5.0 6.5 Minimum capital ratios 8.0 6.0 4.0 4.5 
 The Company is also required to maintain specified levels of capital to remain in good standing with certain federal government agencies, including FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA, and HUD. These capital requirements are generally tied to the unpaid balances of loans included in the Company's servicing portfolio or loan production volume. Noncompliance with these capital requirements can result in various remedial actions up to, and including, removing the Company's ability to sell loans to and service loans on behalf of the respective agency. The Company believes that it is in compliance with these requirements as of December 31, 2022.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contain a discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies, including information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements, adoption of such policies, and the related impact of their adoption. The Company believes that certain of these policies, along with various estimates that it is required to make in recording its financial transactions, are important to have a complete understanding of the Company's financial position. In addition, these estimates require management to make complex and subjective judgments, many of which include matters with a high degree of uncertainty. The following is a summary of these critical accounting policies and significant estimates. 
 Allowance for credit losses 
 The ACL guidance requires that an organization measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date, including off-balance sheet credit exposures, based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods, evaluations of the overall loan portfolio, in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the ACL and credit loss expense in those future periods. The allowance level is influenced by loan volumes and mix, average remaining maturities, loan performance metrics, asset quality characteristics, delinquency status, historical credit loss experience, and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the allowance level was most impacted by the Company's strong loan growth, which resulted in recognition of a provision for credit losses of 68.1 million. Changes to the assumptions in the model in future periods could have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. See "Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of the Company's methodologies for estimating expected credit losses. 
 Fair value of financial instruments 
 The Company uses fair value measurements to recognize certain financial instruments at fair value. The Company holds financial instruments, including loans HFS, MSRs, and derivative instruments, that are recorded at fair value and require management to make significant judgments in estimating the fair value of these financial instruments. The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market inputs. For financial instruments that are actively traded and have quoted market prices or observable market inputs, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. However, when quoted market prices or observable market inputs are not fully available, significant management judgment may be necessary to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments. The fair value of MSRs is determined using a discounted cash flow model based on unobservable inputs, as MSRs are not traded in active markets. Assumptions used to value the Company s MSRs represent management s best estimate of assumptions that market participants would use to value this asset and may require significant judgement. The primary risk of material changes to the value of the MSRs resides in the potential volatility and judgment in the assumptions used, specifically prepayment speeds, option adjusted spreads, and discount rates. Hypothetical changes in the value of MSRs based on assumed immediate changes in certain inputs are disclosed in Note 6. Mortgage Servicing Rights in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
 Income taxes 
 The Company s income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid. The Company is subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States. Significant judgments and estimates are required in the determination of the consolidated income tax expense. 
 Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating the Company's ability to recover its DTAs in the jurisdictions from which they arise, all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies, projected future taxable income, and recent operating results. The assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying business.

 Liquidity 
 Liquidity is the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth and business operations, and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates. Liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet the needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in the Company's business operations or unanticipated events. 
 The ability to have readily available funds sufficient to repay fully maturing liabilities is of primary importance to depositors, creditors, and regulators. The Company's liquidity, represented by cash and amounts due from banks, federal funds sold, loans HFS, and non-pledged marketable securities, is a result of the Company's operating, investing, and financing activities and related cash flows. The Company actively monitors and manages liquidity, and no less than quarterly will estimate probable liquidity needs on a 12-month horizon. Liquidity needs can also be met through short-term borrowings or the disposition of short-term assets.

The Company does not believe that these off-balance sheet arrangements have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. However, there can be no assurance that such arrangements will not have a future effect. 
 The Company has a formal liquidity policy and, in the opinion of management, its liquid assets are considered adequate to meet cash flow needs for loan funding and deposit cash withdrawals for the next 90-120 days. At December 31, 2022, there were 7.7 billion in liquid assets, comprised of 1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents, 1.1 billion in loans HFS, and 5.5 billion in unpledged marketable securities. At December 31, 2021, the Company maintained 8.7 billion in liquid assets, comprised of 516 million of cash and cash equivalents, 4.0 billion in loans HFS, and 4.2 billion of unpledged marketable securities. 
 The Parent maintains liquidity that would be sufficient to fund its operations and certain non-bank affiliate operations for an extended period should funding from normal sources be disrupted. In the Company's analysis of Parent liquidity, it is assumed that the Parent is unable to generate funds from additional debt or equity issuances, receives no dividend income from subsidiaries and does not pay dividends to stockholders, while continuing to make non-discretionary payments needed to maintain operations and repayment of contractual principal and interest payments owed by the Parent and affiliated companies.

 Under this scenario, the amount of time the Parent and its non-bank subsidiary can operate and meet all obligations before the current liquid assets are exhausted is considered as part of the Parent liquidity analysis. Management believes the Parent maintains adequate liquidity capacity to operate without additional funding from new sources for over twelve months. 
 WAB maintains sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements, such as deposit outflows. This capacity is comprised of liquidity derived from a reduction in asset levels and various secured funding sources. On a long-term basis, the Company s liquidity will be met by changing the relative distribution of its asset portfolios (for example, by reducing investment or loan volumes, or selling or encumbering assets). Further, the Company can increase liquidity by soliciting higher levels of deposit accounts through promotional activities and/or borrowing from correspondent banks, the FHLB of San Francisco, and the FRB. At December 31, 2022, the Company's long-term liquidity needs primarily relate to funds required to support loan originations, commitments, and deposit withdrawals, which can be met by cash flows from investment payments and maturities, and investment sales, if necessary. 
 The Company s liquidity is comprised of three primary classifications: 1) cash flows provided by operating activities; 2) cash flows used in investing activities; and 3) cash flows provided by financing activities. Net cash provided by or used in operating activities consists primarily of net income, adjusted for changes in certain other asset and liability accounts and certain non-cash income and expense items, such as the provision for credit losses, investment and other amortization and depreciation. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was 2.2 billion, (2.7) billion, and 670.2 million, respectively. 
 The Company's primary investing activities are the origination of real estate and commercial loans, the collection of repayments of these loans, and the purchase and sale of securities. The Company's net cash provided by and used in investing activities has been primarily influenced by its loan and securities activities. The Company's cash balance during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, was reduced by 11.2 billion, 12.7 billion, and 5.9 billion, respectively, as a result of a net increase in loans as well as a net increase in investment securities of 1.8 billion, 2.0 billion, and 1.5 billion, respectively. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities has been impacted significantly by increased deposit levels. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, net deposits increased 6.0 billion, 15.7 billion, and 9.1 billion, respectively. 
 Fluctuations in core deposit levels may increase the Company's need for liquidity as certificates of deposit mature or are withdrawn before maturity, and as non-maturity deposits, such as checking and savings account balances, are withdrawn. Additionally, the Company is exposed to the risk that customers with large deposit balances will withdraw all or a portion of such deposits, due in part to the FDIC limitations on the amount of insurance coverage provided to depositors. To mitigate the uninsured deposit risk, the Company participates in the CDARS and ICS programs, which allow an individual customer to invest up to 50.0 million and 150.0 million, respectively, through one participating financial institution or, a combined total of 200.0 million per individual customer, with the entire amount being covered by FDIC insurance. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has 683 million of CDARS and 2.1 billion of ICS deposits. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company has 4.8 billion of wholesale brokered deposits outstanding. Brokered deposits are generally considered to be deposits that have been received from a third party who is engaged in the business of placing deposits on behalf of others. A traditional deposit broker will direct deposits to the banking institution offering the highest interest rate available. Federal banking laws and regulations place restrictions on depository institutions regarding brokered deposits because of the general concern that these deposits are not relationship based and are at a greater risk of being withdrawn and placed on deposit at another institution offering a higher interest rate, thus posing liquidity risk for institutions that gather brokered deposits in significant amounts. 
 Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid. The total amount of dividends which may be paid at any date is generally limited to the retained earnings of the bank. Dividends paid by WAB to the Parent would be prohibited if the effect thereof would cause the Bank s capital to be reduced below applicable minimum capital requirements. During the year ended December 31, 2022, WAB and CSI paid dividends to the Parent of 105.0 million and 155.0 million, respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, WAB paid dividends to the Parent of 55.0 million.

 SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 
 WAL, WAB, and certain of its non-banking subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws. The regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks is intended to protect depositors, the DIF, and the U.S. banking system as a whole. This system is not designed to protect equity investors in bank holding companies such as WAL. 
 Set forth below is a summary of the significant laws and regulations applicable to WAL and its subsidiaries. The description that follows is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations, and policies that are described. Such statutes, regulations, and policies are subject to ongoing review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. A change in any of the statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies applicable to WAL and its subsidiaries could have a material effect on the results of the Company. 
 Overview 
 WAL is a separate and distinct legal entity from WAB and its other subsidiaries. As a registered bank holding company, WAL is subject to inspection, examination, and supervision by the FRB, and is regulated under the BHCA. WAL is also under the jurisdiction of the SEC and is subject to the disclosure and other regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Exchange Act, as administered by the SEC. The Company s common stock is listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol WAL and the Company is subject to the rules of the NYSE for listed companies. The Company is a financial institution holding company within the meaning of Arizona law. WAL provides a full spectrum of deposit, lending, treasury management, and online banking products and services through WAB, its wholly-owned banking subsidiary. WAB is an Arizona chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System. WAB operates the following full-service banking divisions: ABA, BON, Bridge, FIB, and TPB. WAB is subject to the supervision of, and to regular examination by, the Arizona Department of Financial Institutions, the FRB as its primary federal regulator, and the FDIC as its deposit insurer. WAB's deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable deposit insurance limits in accordance with FDIC laws and regulations. The Company also serves business customers through a national platform of specialized financial services providers. 
 WAL and WAB are also supervised by the CFPB for compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws. The Company s non-bank subsidiaries are subject to federal and state laws and regulations, including regulations of the FRB. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the financial regulatory regime in the United States. Since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, U.S. banks and financial services firms have been subject to enhanced regulation and oversight. Several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to further rulemaking, guidance, and interpretation by the federal banking agencies. 
 Enacted in 2018, the EGRRCPA, among other things, amended certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The EGRRCPA provides limited regulatory relief to certain financial institutions while preserving the existing framework under which U.S. financial institutions are regulated. The EGRRCPA relieves bank holding companies with less than 100 billion in assets, such as the Company, from the enhanced prudential standards imposed under Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act (including, but not limited to, resolution planning and enhanced liquidity and risk management requirements). In addition to amending the Dodd-Frank Act, the EGRRCPA also includes certain additional banking-related provisions, consumer protection provisions and securities law-related provisions. While many of the EGRRCPA s changes have been implemented through rules adopted by federal agencies, the Company expects to continue to evaluate the potential impact of the EGRRCPA as it is further implemented. 
 Supervision, Regulation and Licensing of AmeriHome 
 AmeriHome is a residential mortgage producer and servicer that operates in a heavily regulated industry. In addition to supervision by the federal banking agencies with primary jurisdiction over the Company and WAB, AmeriHome is subject to the rules, regulations and oversight of certain federal, state and local governmental authorities, including the CFPB, HUD, and GNMA, and government-sponsored enterprises in the mortgage industry such as FHLMC and FNMA. 
 Further, AmeriHome must comply with a large number of federal consumer protection laws and regulations including, among others: 
 the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X, which require lenders, mortgage brokers, or servicers to provide borrowers with pertinent and timely disclosures regarding the nature and costs of the settlement process and prohibit specific practices related thereto; 
 the Truth In Lending Act and Regulation Z, which require disclosures and timely information on the nature and costs of the residential mortgages and the real estate settlement process; 
 57 

Table of Contents 

 the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act, which applies to businesses and individuals engaging in the residential mortgage loan business; 
 the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, and the rules and regulations of the FTC and CFPB that prohibit unfair, abusive or deceptive acts or practices; 
 the Fair Credit Reporting Act (as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act) and Regulation V, which address the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies; and 
 the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, the Fair Housing Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C, which generally disallow discrimination on a prohibited basis, provide applicants and borrowers rights with respect to credit decisioning and the residential mortgage process, and require disclosures and impose obligations on financial businesses conducting residential lending and mortgage servicing. 
 The CFPB as well as the FTC have rulemaking authority with respect to many of the federal consumer protection laws applicable to mortgage lenders and servicers, and their rulemaking and regulatory agendas relating to the residential mortgage industry continues to evolve. In particular, as part of its enforcement authority, the CFPB can order, among other things, rescission or reformation of contracts, the refund of moneys or the return of real property, restitution, disgorgement or compensation for unjust enrichment, the payment of damages or other monetary relief, public notifications regarding violations, remediation of practices, external compliance monitoring and civil money penalties. 
 AmeriHome is also subject to state and local laws, rules and regulations and oversight by various state agencies that license and oversee consumer protection, loan servicing, origination and collection activities of mortgage industry participants. Despite the fact that AmeriHome is the operating subsidiary of a depository institution, it must comply with regulatory and licensing requirements in certain states in order to conduct its business, and does (and will continue to) incur significant costs to comply with these requirements. These laws, rules and regulations may change as statutes and regulations are enacted, promulgated, amended, interpreted and enforced. 
 Supervision and Regulation of WATC 
 WATC is an OCC-chartered, non-depository national trust bank. WATC will offer levered loan facility administration, loan administration, and securities custody products. As a national trust bank, the ability of WATC to engage in fiduciary activities is governed by federal law at 12 U.S.C. 92a and the OCC regulations at 12 C.F.R. Part 9, as well as certain state laws to the extent not preempted by federal law and regulation. WATC may engage in any of the enumerated activities or roles permitted for national trust banks listed in federal statutes and regulations as well as any other capacity that the OCC authorizes pursuant to federal law. As a non-depository national trust bank, WATC may not accept deposits and is not subject to legal requirements to maintain FDIC deposit insurance. 
 The OCC has primary supervisory and regulatory authority over the operations of WATC. As part of this authority, WATC is required to file periodic reports with the OCC and is subject to supervision and periodic examination by the OCC. To support its supervisory function, the OCC has the authority to assess and charge fees on all national banks, including non-depository national trust banks like WATC. 
 Bank Holding Company Regulation 
 WAL is a bank holding company as defined under the BHCA. The BHCA generally limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks, and other activities that the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. Business activities that have been determined to be related to banking, and therefore appropriate for bank holding companies and their affiliates to engage in, include securities brokerage services, investment advisory services, fiduciary services, and certain management advisory and data processing services, among others. Bank holding companies that have elected to become financial holding companies may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity that is either: (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the FRB in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury) or (ii) complementary to a financial activity, and that does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally (as solely determined by the FRB). Activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting, and making merchant banking investments.

 Mergers and Acquisitions 
 The BHCA, the Bank Merger Act, and other federal and state statutes regulate the direct and indirect acquisition of depository institutions. The BHCA requires prior FRB approval for a bank holding company to acquire, directly or indirectly, 5 or more of any class of voting securities of a commercial bank or its parent holding company and for a company, other than a bank holding company, to acquire 25 or more of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company. In April 2020, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule codifying the presumptions used in determinations of whether a company has the ability to exercise a controlling influence over another company for purposes of the BHCA, and providing greater transparency on the types of relationships that the Federal Reserve generally views as supporting a determination of control. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, any person, including a company, may not acquire, directly or indirectly, control of a bank without providing 60 days prior notice and receiving a non-objection from the appropriate federal banking agency. 
 Under the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of the appropriate federal banking agency is required for insured depository institutions to merge or enter into purchase and assumption transactions. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and purchase and assumption transactions, the federal banking agencies will consider, among other things, the competitive effects and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the combined banking organization, the applicant's performance record under the CRA, and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities. For further information relating to the CRA, see the section titled Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. 
 Under Section 6-142 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, no person may acquire control of a company that controls an Arizona bank without the prior approval of the Arizona Superintendent of Financial Institutions, or Arizona Superintendent. A person who has the power to vote 15 or more of the voting stock of a controlling company is presumed to control the company. 
 Enhanced Prudential Standards 
 Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act imposes enhanced prudential standards on larger banking organizations, with certain of these standards applicable to banking organizations over 10 billion, including WAL and WAB, as of the quarter ending June 30, 2014. In October 2012, the FDIC, the OCC, and the FRB issued separate but similar rules requiring covered banks and bank holding companies with 10 billion to 50 billion in total consolidated assets to conduct an annual company-run stress test. WAL and WAB conducted a company-run capital stress test as required by the Dodd-Frank Act in 2017 and provided the results to the FRB. WAL found the Company would have sufficient capital to maintain regulatory capital levels throughout an economic downturn. 
 As a result of passage of the EGRRCPA, bank holding companies with less than 100 billion in assets, such as the Company, are exempt from the enhanced prudential standards imposed under Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act (including, but not limited to, the resolution planning and enhanced liquidity and risk management requirements therein). Notwithstanding these changes, the capital planning and risk management practices of the Company and the Bank will continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory processes of the FRB. Further, in connection with the FRB s rules implementing the enhanced prudential standards required by Dodd-Frank (and as subsequently modified by application of the EGRRCPA s higher consolidated asset thresholds for bank holding companies), the Company has established a risk committee of the BOD to manage enterprise-wide risk and has retained its separate risk committee of independent directors.

 Volcker Rule 
 Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly known as the Volcker Rule, restricts the ability of banking entities, such as the Company and WAB, from: (i) engaging in proprietary trading and (ii) investing in or sponsoring certain covered funds, subject to certain limited exceptions. Under the Volcker Rule, the term "covered funds" is defined as any issuer that would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act but for the exemption in Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act, which includes CLO and CDO securities. There are also several exemptions from the definition of covered fund, including, among other things, loan securitizations, joint ventures, certain types of foreign funds, entities issuing asset-backed commercial paper, and registered investment companies. Further, the final rules permit banking entities, subject to certain conditions and limitations, to invest in or sponsor a covered fund in connection with: (1) organizing and offering the covered fund; (2) certain risk-mitigating hedging activities; and (3) de minimis investments in covered funds. Compliance with the Volcker Rule was required by July 21, 2017. 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 The EGRRCPA and subsequent promulgation of inter-agency final rules have aimed at simplifying and tailoring requirements related to the Volcker Rule, including by eliminating collection of certain metrics and reducing the compliance burdens associated with other metrics for banks with less than 20 billion in average trading assets and liabilities. In June 2020, the Federal Reserve - along with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, FDIC, the OCC, and the SEC - issued a final rule modifying the Volcker Rule s prohibition on banking entities investing in or sponsoring hedge funds or private equity funds covered funds ). The Volcker Rule generally prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and from acquiring or retaining ownership interests in, sponsoring or having certain relationships with a hedge fund or private equity fund. The final rule modifies three areas of the Volcker Rule by: (1) streamlining the covered funds portion of the rule; (2) addressing the extraterritorial treatment of certain foreign funds; and (3) permitting banking entities to offer financial services and engage in other activities that do not raise concerns that the Volcker Rule was intended to address. The new rule became effective October 1, 2020. The Company believes it is fully compliant with the Volcker Rule, including as modified by the new rule. 
 Dividends 
 The Company has paid regular quarterly dividends since the third quarter of 2019. Whether the Company continues to pay quarterly dividends and the amount of any such dividends will be at the discretion of WAL's BOD and will depend on the Company s earnings, financial condition, results of operations, business prospects, capital requirements, regulatory restrictions, contractual restrictions, and other factors that the BOD may deem relevant. 
 The Company s ability to pay dividends is subject to the regulatory authority of the FRB. The supervisory concern of the FRB focuses on a bank holding company s capital position, its ability to meet its financial obligations as they come due, and its capacity to act as a source of financial strength to its insured depository institution subsidiaries. In addition, FRB policy discourages the payment of dividends by a bank holding company that is not supported by current operating earnings. 
 As a Delaware corporation, the Company is also subject to limitations under Delaware law on the payment of dividends. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, dividends may only be paid out of surplus or out of net profits for the year in which the dividend is declared or the preceding year, and no dividends may be paid on common stock at any time during which the capital of outstanding preferred stock or preference stock exceeds the Company's net assets. 
 From time to time, the Company may become a party to financing agreements and other contractual obligations that have the effect of limiting or prohibiting the declaration or payment of dividends under certain circumstances. Holding company expenses and obligations with respect to its outstanding trust preferred securities and corresponding subordinated debt also may limit or impair the Company s ability to declare and pay dividends. 
 Since the Company has no significant assets other than the voting stock of its subsidiaries, it currently depends on dividends from WAB and, to a lesser extent, its non-bank subsidiaries, for a substantial portion of its revenue and as the primary sources of its cash flow. The ability of a state member bank, such as WAB, to pay cash dividends is restricted by the FRB and the State of Arizona. The FRB s Regulation H states that a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend if the total of all dividends declared during that calendar year exceed the bank s net income during that calendar year and the retained net income of the prior two years. Further, without receiving prior approval from both the FRB and two-thirds of its shareholders, a bank cannot declare or pay a dividend that would exceed its undivided profits or withdraw any portion of its permanent capital. 
 Under Section 6-187 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, WAB may pay dividends on the same basis as any other Arizona corporation, except that cash dividends paid out of capital surplus require the prior approval of the Arizona Superintendent. Under Section 10-640 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, a corporation may not make a distribution to stockholders if to do so would render the corporation insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they become due. However, an Arizona bank may not declare a non-stock dividend out of capital surplus without the approval of the Arizona Superintendent. 
 Federal Reserve System 
 As a member of the Federal Reserve System, WAB has historically been required by law to maintain reserves against its transaction deposits, which were to be held in cash or with the FRB. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve reduced the reserve requirement ratios to zero percent effective on March 26, 2020. 
 Additionally, on June 4, 2021, the Federal Reserve adopted amendments to Regulation D (Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions, 12 C.F.R. Part 204) to eliminate references to an interest on required reserves rate and to an interest on excess reserves rate and replace them with a reference to a single interest on reserve balances rate. The amendments also simplified the formula used to calculate the amount of interest paid on balances maintained by or on behalf of eligible institutions in master accounts at Federal Reserve Banks, and to made other conforming amendments. The rule became effective on July 29, 2021.

 Source of Strength Doctrine 
 FRB policy requires bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. Section 616 of the Dodd-Frank Act codified the requirement that bank holding companies act as a source of financial strength. As a result, the Company is expected to commit resources to support WAB, including at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides that, in the event of a bank holding company's bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal banking agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment. 
 Capital Adequacy 
 The Capital Rules established a comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The Capital Rules generally implement the Basel Committee's Basel III final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards. The Capital Rules revise the definitions and the components of regulatory capital, as well as address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions regulatory capital ratios. The Capital Rules also address asset risk weights and other matters affecting the denominator in banking institutions regulatory capital ratios and replaced the existing general risk-weighting approach with a more risk-sensitive approach. 
 The Capital Rules: (i) include CET1 and the related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets; (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and Additional Tier 1 capital instruments meeting certain revised requirements; (iii) mandate that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital; and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations. Under the Capital Rules, for most banking organizations, the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and the most common forms of Tier 2 capital are subordinated notes and a portion of the allocation for loan and lease losses, in each case, subject to the Capital Rules specific requirements. 
 Pursuant to the Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios are as follows: 
 4.5 CET1 to risk-weighted assets; 
 6.0 Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets; 
 8.0 Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and 
 4.0 Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (called leverage ratio ). 
 The Capital Rules also include a capital conservation buffer, composed entirely of CET1, in addition to these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity, and other capital instrument repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The Capital Rules became fully phased-in on January 1, 2019. Thus, the capital standards applicable to the Company include an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5 of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios inclusive of the capital conservation buffer of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7 , (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5 , and (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5 . 
 The Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing assets, DTAs arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks, and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10 of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15 of CET1. The Capital Rules further prescribe that the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss items reported as a component of stockholders equity be included in CET1 capital; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations may make a one-time permanent election to exclude these items. The Company, as a non-advanced approaches institution, has made this one-time election. 
 The Capital Rules also preclude certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, issued on or after May 19, 2010 from inclusion in bank holding companies Tier 1 capital. The Company has used trust preferred securities in the past as a tool for raising additional Tier 1 capital and otherwise improving its regulatory capital ratios. Although the Company may continue to include its existing trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital, the prohibition on the use of these securities as Tier 1 capital going forward may limit the Company s ability to raise capital in the future.

Table of Contents 

 The risk-weighting categories in the Capital Rules are standardized and include a risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0 for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600 for certain equity exposures, and higher risk weights for a variety of asset classes. 
 As of April 1, 2020, final rules became effective simplifying the capital treatment for mortgage servicing assets, certain DTAs, investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions, and minority interest. Management believes the Company is in compliance, and will continue to be in compliance, with the targeted capital ratios. 
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal bank regulatory authorities issued a final rule in late August 2020 that allows institutions that adopted the CECL accounting standard in 2020 to mitigate CECL s estimated effects on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. The Company has elected this capital relief option. 
 Prompt Corrective Action and Safety and Soundness 
 Pursuant to Section 38 of the FDIA, federal banking agencies are required to take prompt corrective action should a depository institution fail to meet certain capital adequacy standards. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. 
 For purposes of prompt corrective action, to be: (i) well-capitalized, a bank must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least 10 , a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of at least 8 , a CET1 risk based capital ratio of at least 6.5 , and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 ; (ii) adequately capitalized, a bank must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least 8 , a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of at least 6 , a CET1 risk based capital ratio of at least 4.5 , and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4 ; (iii) undercapitalized, a bank would have a total risk based capital ratio of less than 8 , a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of less than 6 , a CET1 risk based capital ratio of less than 4.5 , and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4 ; (iv) significantly undercapitalized, a bank would have a total risk based capital ratio of less than 6 , a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of less than 4 , a CET1 risk based capital ratio of less than 3 , and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3 ; (v) critically undercapitalized, a bank would have a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is less than or equal to 2 . 
 Bank holding companies and insured banks also may be subject to potential enforcement actions of varying levels of severity by the federal banking agencies for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business, or for violation of any law, rule, regulation, condition imposed in writing by the agency or term of a written agreement with the agency. In more serious cases, enforcement actions may include: (i) the issuance of directives to increase capital; (ii) the issuance of formal and informal agreements; (iii) the imposition of civil monetary penalties; (iv) the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced; (v) the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers, directors, and other institution-affiliated parties; (vi) the termination of the bank s deposit insurance; (vii) the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the bank; and (viii) the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted. 
 Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders 
 Under federal law, transactions between insured depository institutions and their affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA and implementing Regulation W. In a bank holding company context, at a minimum, the parent holding company of a bank, and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company, are affiliates of the bank. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA are intended to protect insured depository institutions from losses arising from transactions with non-insured affiliates by limiting the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate and with all affiliates of the bank in the aggregate, and requiring that such transactions be on terms consistent with safe and sound banking practices.

 Further, Section 22(h) of the FRA and its implementing Regulation O restricts loans to directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders insiders ). Under Section 22(h), loans to insiders and their related interests may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such persons and affiliated entities, the institution's total capital and surplus. Loans to insiders above specified amounts must receive the prior approval of the BOD. Further, under Section 22(h) of the FRA, loans to directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons, except that such insiders may receive preferential loans made under a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to the bank's employees and does not give preference to the insider over the employees. Section 22(g) of the FRA places additional limitations on loans to executive officers. 
 Lending Limits 
 In addition to the requirements set forth above, state banking law generally limits the amount of funds that a state-chartered bank may lend to a single borrower. Under Section 6-352 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, the obligations of one borrower to a bank may not exceed 20 of the bank s capital, plus an additional 10 of its capital if the additional amounts are fully secured by readily marketable collateral. 
 Brokered Deposits 
 Section 29 of the FDIA and FDIC regulations generally limit the ability of any bank to accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless it is well capitalized or, with the FDIC s approval, adequately capitalized. On December 15, 2020, the FDIC issued rules to revise brokered deposit regulations in light of modern deposit-taking methods. The rules established a new framework for certain provisions of the deposit broker definition and amended the FDIC s interest rate methodology calculating rates and rate caps. The rules became effective on April 1, 2021 and, to date, there has been no material impact to either the Company or the Bank from the rules. 
 Consumer Protection and CFPB Supervision 
 The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating the CFPB, an independent agency charged with responsibility for implementing, enforcing, and examining compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws. The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Procedures Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Practices Act, various state law counterparts, and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, which is part of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act does not prevent states from adopting stricter consumer protection standards. State regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, or operations. 
 Depositor Preference 
 The FDIA provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution. 
 Federal Deposit Insurance 
 Substantially all of the deposits of WAB are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC s DIF. The basic limit on FDIC deposit insurance is 250,000 per depositor. WAB is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. 
 The FDIC uses a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank's CAMELS rating. The risk matrix utilizes different risk categories distinguished by capital levels and supervisory ratings. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the base for insurance assessments is now consolidated average assets less average tangible equity. Assessment rates are calculated using formulas that take into account the risk of the institution being assessed. WAB is classified as, and subject to the scorecard for, a large and highly complex institution to determine its total base assessment rate. 
 Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. The Company s management is not aware of any practice, condition, or violation that might lead to the termination of its deposit insurance.

 Financial Privacy and Data Security 
 The Company is subject to federal laws, including the GLBA, and certain state laws containing consumer privacy protection provisions. These provisions limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to affiliated and non-affiliated third parties and limit the reuse of certain consumer information received from non-affiliated institutions. These provisions require notice of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to affiliates or non-affiliated third parties by means of opt out or opt in authorizations. 
 For example, in August 2018, the CFPB published its final rule to update Regulation P pursuant to the amended GLBA. Under this rule, certain qualifying financial institutions are not required to provide annual privacy notices to customers. To qualify, a financial institution must not share nonpublic personal information about customers except as described in certain statutory exceptions that do not trigger a customer s statutory opt-out right. In addition, the financial institution must not have changed its disclosure policies and practices from those disclosed in its most recent privacy notice. The rule sets forth timing requirements for delivery of annual privacy notices in the event that a financial institution that qualified for the annual notice exemption later changes its policies or practices in such a way that it no longer qualifies for the exemption. 
 The GLBA also requires that financial institutions implement comprehensive written information security programs that include administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect consumer information. Further, pursuant to interpretive guidance issued under the GLBA and certain state laws, financial institutions are required to notify customers of security breaches that result in unauthorized access to their nonpublic personal information. 
 For example, under California law, every business that owns or licenses personal information about a California resident must maintain reasonable security procedures and policies to protect that information and comply with specific requirements relating to the destruction of records containing personal information and disclosure of breaches to customers, and restrictions on the use of customer information unless the customer "opts in." Other states, including Arizona and Nevada where WAB has branches, may also have applicable laws requiring businesses that retain consumer personal information to develop reasonable security policies and procedures, notify consumers of a security breach, or provide disclosures about the use and sharing of consumer personal information. 
 The federal banking agencies, including the FRB, through the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, have adopted guidelines to encourage financial institutions to address cybersecurity risks and identify, assess, and mitigate these risks, both internally and at critical third-party services providers. In October 2016, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued proposed rules on enhanced cybersecurity risk management and resilience standards that would apply to very large financial institutions and to services provided by third parties to these institutions. The comment period for these proposed rules has closed and a final rule has not been published. 
 On November 18, 2021, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued final rule to improve the sharing of information about cyber incidents that may affect the U.S. banking system. The rule requires a banking organization to notify its primary federal regulator of any significant computer-security incident as soon as possible and no later than 36 hours after the banking organization determines that a cyber incident has occurred. Notification is required for incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the viability of a banking organization s operations, its ability to deliver banking products and services, or the stability of the financial sector. In addition, the rule requires a bank service provider to notify affected banking organization customers as soon as possible when the provider determines that it has experienced a computer-security incident that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect banking organization customers for four or more hours. The rule became effective May 1, 2022. 
 These laws and regulations impose compliance costs and create obligations and, in some cases, reporting obligations, and compliance with these laws, regulations, and obligations require significant resources of WAL and WAB. 
 Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws 
 WAB has a responsibility under the CRA to help meet the credit needs of its communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution's discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit discrimination in lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. WAB s failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities and the activities of the Company. WAB s failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions. WAB received a rating of Satisfactory in its most recent CRA examination, in January 2019.

 Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco 
 WAB is a member of the FHLB of San Francisco, which is one of 12 regional FHLBs that provide funding to their members to support residential lending, as well as affordable housing and community development loans. Each FHLB serves as a reserve, or central bank, for the members within its assigned region. Each FHLB makes loans to its members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the FHLB. As a member, WAB must purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of San Francisco. At December 31, 2022, WAB s total investment in FHLB stock was 134 million. 
 Incentive Compensation 
 The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities, including the Company and WAB, with at least 1 billion in total consolidated assets, that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. The federal banking agencies and the SEC most recently proposed such regulations in 2016, but the regulations have not yet been finalized. If the regulations are adopted in the form initially proposed, they will restrict the manner in which executive compensation is structured. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act also requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation at least every three years and on so-called golden parachute payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions. WAL gives stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation annually. 
 Preventing Suspicious Activity 
 Under Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act, all financial institutions are required to take certain measures to identify their customers, prevent money laundering, monitor customer transactions, and report suspicious activity to U.S. law enforcement agencies. Financial institutions also are required to respond to requests for information from federal banking agencies and law enforcement agencies. Information sharing among financial institutions for the above purposes is encouraged by an exemption granted to complying financial institutions from the privacy provisions of the GLBA and other privacy laws. Financial institutions that hold correspondent accounts for foreign banks or provide private banking services to foreign individuals are required to take measures to avoid dealing with certain foreign individuals or entities, including foreign banks with profiles that raise money laundering concerns, and are prohibited from dealing with foreign shell banks and persons from jurisdictions of particular concern. The primary federal banking agencies and the Secretary of the Treasury have adopted regulations to implement several of these provisions. All financial institutions also are required to establish internal anti-money laundering programs. The effectiveness of a financial institution in combating money laundering activities is a factor to be considered in any application submitted by the financial institution under the Bank Merger Act. The Company has a Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act Board-approved compliance program and engages in relatively few transactions with foreign financial institutions or foreign persons. 
 The FCRA s Red Flags Rule requires financial institutions with covered accounts (e.g., consumer bank accounts and loans) to develop, implement, and administer an identity theft prevention program. This program must include reasonable policies and procedures to detect suspicious patterns or practices that indicate the possibility of identity theft, such as inconsistencies in personal information or changes in account activity. 
 Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation 
 The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals, and others. These are typically known as the OFAC rules based on their administration by the OFAC. The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on U.S. persons engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off, or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.

 Future Legislative Initiatives 
 Federal and state legislatures may introduce legislation that will impact the financial services industry. In addition, federal banking agencies may introduce regulatory initiatives that are likely to impact the financial services industry, generally. However it is not clear whether such changes will be enacted or, if enacted, what their effect on the Company will be. New legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. A change in statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies applicable to WAL or any of its subsidiaries could have a material effect on the business of the Company. 
 
 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 Market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices. The Company's market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending, investing, and deposit taking activities. To that end, management actively monitors and manages the Company's interest rate risk exposure. The Company generally manages its interest rate sensitivity by evaluating re-pricing opportunities on its earning assets to those on its funding liabilities. 
 Management uses various asset/liability strategies to manage the re-pricing characteristics of the Company's assets and liabilities, all of which are designed to ensure that exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited to within the Company's guidelines of acceptable levels of risk-taking. Hedging strategies, including the terms and pricing of loans and deposits and management of the deployment of its securities, are used to reduce mismatches in interest rate re-pricing opportunities of portfolio assets and their funding sources. 
 Interest rate risk is addressed by ALCO, which includes members of executive management, finance, and operations. ALCO monitors interest rate risk by analyzing the potential impact on the net EVE and net interest income from potential changes in interest rates and considers the impact of alternative strategies or changes in balance sheet structure. The Company manages its balance sheet in part to maintain the potential impact on EVE and net interest income within acceptable ranges despite changes in interest rates. 
 The Company's exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed at least quarterly by ALCO. Interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine its change in both EVE and net interest income in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates. If potential changes to EVE and net interest income resulting from hypothetical interest rate changes are not within the limits established by the BOD, the BOD may direct management to adjust the asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within Board-approved limits. 
 Net Interest Income Simulation. To measure interest rate risk at December 31, 2022, the Company used a simulation model to project changes in net interest income that result from forecasted changes in interest rates. This analysis calculates the difference between a baseline net interest income forecast using current yield curves that do not take into consideration any future anticipated rate hikes, compared to forecasted net income resulting from an immediate parallel shift in rates upward or downward, along with other scenarios directed by ALCO. The income simulation model includes various assumptions regarding re-pricing relationships for each of the Company's products. Many of the Company's assets are variable rate loans, which are assumed to re-price immediately and, proportional to the change in market rates, depending on their contracted index, including the impact of caps or floors. Some loans and investments contain contractual prepayment features (embedded options) and, accordingly, the simulation model incorporates prepayment assumptions. The Company's non-term deposit products re-price concurrently with interest rate changes taken by the FOMC. 
 This analysis indicates the impact of changes in net interest income for the given set of rate changes and assumptions. It assumes the balance sheet remains static and that its structure does not change over the course of the year. It does not account for all factors that could impact the Company's results, including changes by management to mitigate interest rate changes or secondary factors, such as changes to the Company's credit risk profile as interest rates change. 
 Furthermore, loan prepayment rate estimates and spread relationships change regularly. Interest rate changes create changes in actual loan prepayment speeds that will differ from the market estimates incorporated in this analysis. Changes that vary significantly from the modeled assumptions may have a significant effect on the Company's actual net interest income.

 This simulation model assesses the changes in net interest income that would occur in response to an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease (shock) in market interest rates. At December 31, 2022, our net interest income exposure for the next twelve months related to these hypothetical changes in market interest rates was within our current guidelines.

 Economic Value of Equity. The Company measures the impact of market interest rate changes on the NPV of estimated cash flows from its assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet items, defined as EVE, using a simulation model. This simulation model assesses the changes in the market value of interest rate sensitive financial instruments that would occur in response to an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease (shock) in market interest rates. 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company's EVE exposure related to these hypothetical changes in market interest rates was within the Company's current guidelines, with the exception of the Up 100 rate scenario, where there was a slight breach on the Company's guideline of (10.0) . The breach is the result of a decline in duration of the Company's deposit liabilities from lower non-interest bearing deposit balances and increasing decay rates as well as an increase in the duration of earning assets related to decreases in loans HFS and shorter-term investments. The BOD and ALCO have accepted the breach and believe that as the Company continues to grow its balance sheet with an emphasis on deposits, the EVE exposure in the Up 100 rate scenario will be reduced. 
 The following table shows the Company's projected change in EVE for this set of rate shocks at December 31, 2022: 
 Economic Value of Equity 
 Interest Rate Scenario (change in basis points from Base) Down 200 Down 100 Base Up 100 Up 200 Up 300 (in millions) Assets 66,887 64,861 63,049 61,484 60,126 58,939 Liabilities 57,278 56,310 55,527 54,765 54,034 53,255 Net Present Value 9,609 8,551 7,522 6,719 6,092 5,684 Change 27.7 13.7 (10.7) (19.0) (24.4) 
 The computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, asset prepayments, and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Further, the computations do not contemplate any actions the Company may undertake in response to changes in interest rates. Actual amounts may differ from the projections set forth above should market conditions vary from the underlying assumptions.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Western Alliance Bancorporation 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Western Alliance Bancorporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). 
 In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013, and our report, dated February 23, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses Loans Held for Investment 
 As described in Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements, the Company s allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment and unfunded loan commitments totaled 310 million and million as of December 31, 2022, respectively. The allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment and unfunded loan commitments is calculated under the expected credit loss model and is an estimate of life-of-loan losses for the Company s loans held for investment and unfunded loan commitments. 
 The allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment consists of an asset-specific component for estimating credit losses for individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and a pooled component for estimating credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments consists of a pooled component for estimating credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics and includes consideration of the likelihood that estimated funding levels will occur. The allowance for the pooled component for the allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment and the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is 
 70 

Table of Contents 

 derived from an estimate of expected credit losses primarily using an expected loss methodology that incorporates risk parameters (probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default) which are derived from various vendor models, internally developed statistical models or nonstatistical estimation approaches. 
 Probability of default is projected in these models or estimation approaches using economic scenarios, whose outcomes are weighted based on the Company s economic outlook and were developed to incorporate relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 
 Loss given default is typically derived from the Company s own loss experience; however, for the warehouse lending, equity fund resources and municipal and nonprofit loan segments, non-modeled methodologies are employed to estimate loss given default. 
 Exposure at default refers to the Company s exposure to loss at the time of borrower default. For revolving lines of credit, the Company incorporates an expectation of increased line utilization for a higher exposure at default on defaulted loans based on historical experience. For term loans, exposure at default is calculated using an amortization schedule based on loan terms, adjusted for prepayment assumptions. 
 The quantitative estimates of expected credit losses derived from the probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default are then adjusted to incorporate considerations of current trends and conditions that are not captured in the quantitative credit loss estimates through the use of qualitative or environmental factors. The measurement of expected credit losses is influenced by loan volumes, loan mix, loan performance metrics, asset quality characteristics, delinquency status, historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. 
 The estimation of the allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment for pools of loans and unfunded loan commitments that share similar risk characteristics involves many inputs and assumptions, many of which are derived from various vendor and in-house models. These inputs and assumptions include, among others, the selection, evaluation and measurement of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios, which requires management to apply a significant amount of judgment and involves a high degree of estimation. 
 We identified the determination and evaluation of the probability of default, loss given default, exposure at default and estimated unfunded credit utilization assumptions and forecasted economic scenario components of the allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment and the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments as a critical audit matter because auditing the underlying assumptions, and economic scenario forecasts used in the allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment and the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments involved a high degree of complexity and auditor judgment given the high degree of subjectivity exercised by management in developing the allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment and the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments, which resulted in high estimation uncertainty. 
 Our audit procedures related to management s evaluation and establishment of the probability of default, loss given default, exposure at default and estimated unfunded credit utilization assumptions and forecasted economic scenarios components of the allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment and the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments included the following, among others: 
 We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to the evaluation and establishment of the probability of default, loss given default, exposure at default and estimated unfunded credit utilization assumptions and the forecasted economic scenario components of the allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness. 
 We tested management s process and significant judgments in the evaluation and establishment of the probability of default, loss given default, exposure at default and estimated unfunded credit utilization assumptions and forecasted economic scenario components of the allowance for credit losses, which included: 
 We evaluated management s considerations and data utilized as a basis for the probability of default, loss given default, exposure at default and estimated unfunded credit utilization assumptions and selection of forecasted economic scenarios and weightings and tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data that was available to management. 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of management s judgments related to the probability of default, loss given default, exposure at default and estimated unfunded credit utilization assumptions and forecasted scenarios, and qualitative and quantitative assessment of the considerations and data utilized in the determination of the

 We evaluated the reasonableness of management s judgments related to the establishment of the models being used in determining the probability of default, loss given default, exposure at default and estimated unfunded credit utilization assumptions. 
 We utilized internal specialists to assist in evaluating the statistical documentation and process used by management in validating the models established by vendors. 
 Valuation of Mortgage Servicing Rights 
 As described in Note 6 to the financial statements, the Company s mortgage servicing rights totaled 1,148 million as of December 31, 2022. When the Company sells mortgage loans in the secondary market and retains the right to service these loans, a servicing right asset is capitalized at the time of sale when the benefits of servicing are deemed to be greater than adequate compensation for performing the servicing activities. Mortgage servicing rights represent the then-current fair value of future net cash flows expected to be realized from performing servicing activities. The Company has elected to subsequently measure mortgage servicing rights at fair value. The Company estimates the fair value of mortgage servicing rights using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating the fair value of servicing rights, including, but not limited to, option adjusted spread, conditional prepayment rate, servicing fee rate, and cost to service. 
 We identified the option adjusted spread and conditional prepayment rate assumptions used in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgement required by management in determining these assumptions. Auditing these assumptions involved a high degree of auditor judgement and increased audit effort as there was limited observable market information and the calculated fair value of the mortgage servicing rights is sensitive to changes in these key assumptions. 
 Our audit procedures related to the valuation of mortgage servicing rights as of December 31, 2022 included, among others, testing management s process for determining the fair value, including: 
 We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to the establishment of the option adjusted spread and conditional prepayment assumptions used in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness. 
 We evaluated the appropriateness of the valuation model. 
 We tested the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the model. 
 We utilized valuation specialists to assist with evaluating the reasonableness of the option adjusted spread and conditional prepayment rate assumptions by considering the consistency with external market and industry data.

 2. MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS 
 Acquisition of Digital Disbursements 
 On , the Company completed its acquisition of DST, doing business as Digital Disbursements, a digital payments platform for the class action legal industry. The acquisition of DST extends the Company's digital payment efforts by providing a digital payments platform for the class action market and broader legal industry. 
 This transaction was accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting. Assets purchased and liabilities assumed were recorded at their respective acquisition date estimated fair values, which are final as of December 31, 2022. During the measurement period (not to exceed one year from the acquisition date), the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are subject to adjustment if additional information becomes available to indicate a more accurate or appropriate value for an asset or liability. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company adjusted its initial provisional estimates for identified intangible assets based on new available information regarding conditions that existed as of the acquisition date, and recognized a decrease of million to the fair value of identified intangible assets as a result of adjustments to certain valuation inputs. This measurement period adjustment resulted in a million reduction in previously recorded amortization expense which is a component of Other expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
 Total consideration of million, comprised of cash paid at closing of million and contingent consideration with an estimated fair value of million, was exchanged for all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of DST. The terms of the acquisition include a contingent consideration arrangement that is based on performance for the three year period subsequent to the acquisition. There is no required minimum or maximum payment amount specified under the terms of the contingent consideration agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company adjusted its initial provisional estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration and recognized a decrease of million due to new available information regarding conditions that existed as of the acquisition date and adjustments to certain valuation inputs. The fair value of the contingent consideration recognized on the acquisition date was estimated using a discounted cash flow approach. 
 DST s results of operations have been included in the Company's results beginning January 25, 2022 and are reported as part of the Consumer Related segment. Acquisition and restructure expenses related to the DST acquisition of million for the year ended December 31, 2022, were included as a component of non-interest expense in the Consolidated Income Statement, all of which are acquisition related costs as defined by ASC 805. 
 The fair value amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the DST acquisition are as follows: 
 January 25, 2022 (in millions) Assets acquired: Cash and cash equivalents Identified intangible assets Other assets Total assets Liabilities assumed: Other liabilities Total liabilities Net assets acquired Consideration paid Cash Contingent consideration Total consideration Goodwill

 The following tables summarize the Company's AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2022 and 2021, aggregated by major security type and length of time in a continuous unrealized loss position:

 The total number of AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2022 is , compared to at December 31, 2021. 
 On a quarterly basis, the Company performs an impairment analysis on its AFS debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position at the end of the period to determine whether credit losses should be recognized on these securities. Qualitative considerations made by the Company in its impairment analysis are further discussed below. 
 Government Issued Securities 
 Commercial and residential MBS are issued by either government agencies or GSEs. These securities are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, are highly rated by major rating agencies. Further, principal and interest payments on these securities continue to be made on a timely basis. 
 Non-Government Issued Securities 
 Qualitative factors used in the Company's credit loss assessment of its securities that are not issued and guaranteed by the U.S. government include consideration of any adverse conditions related to a specific security, industry, or geographic region of its securities, any credit ratings below investment grade, the payment structure of the security and the likelihood of the issuer to be able to make payments that increase in the future, and failure of the issuer to make any scheduled principal or interest payments. 
 For the Company's corporate debt and tax-exempt securities, the Company also considers various metrics of the issuer including days of cash on hand, the ratio of long-term debt to total assets, the net change in cash between reporting periods, and consideration of any breach in covenant requirements. The Company's corporate debt securities are investment grade, issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments, and the unrealized losses on these security portfolios primarily relate to changes in interest rates and other market conditions that are not considered to be credit-related issues. The Company 
 101 

Table of Contents 

 continues to receive timely principal and interest payments on its tax-exempt securities and the majority of these issuers have revenues pledged for payment of debt service prior to payment of other types of expenses. 
 For the Company's private label residential MBS, which consist of non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations that are secured by pools of residential mortgage loans, the Company also considers metrics such as securitization risk weight factor, current credit support, whether there were any mortgage principal losses resulting from defaults in payments on the underlying mortgage collateral, and the credit default rate over the last twelve months. These securities primarily carry investment grade credit ratings, principal and interest payments on these securities continue to be made on a timely basis, and credit support for these securities is considered adequate. 
 The Company's CLO portfolio consists of highly rated securitization tranches, containing pools of medium to large-sized corporate, high yield bank loans. These are variable rate securities that have an investment grade rating of Single-A or better. The Company has increased its investment in these securities over the past year and unrealized losses on these securities are primarily a function of the differential from the offer price and the valuation mid-market price as well as changes in interest rates. 
 Unrealized losses on the Company's other securities portfolio relate to taxable municipal and trust preferred securities. The Company is continuing to receive timely principal and interest payments on its taxable municipal securities, these securities continue to be highly rated, and the number of days of cash on hand is strong. The Company's trust preferred securities are investment grade and the issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments. 
 Based on the qualitative factors noted above and as the Company does not intend to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, no credit losses have been recognized on these securities during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. In addition, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, no ACL on the Company's AFS securities has been recognized. 
 The credit loss model under ASC 326-20, applicable to HTM debt securities, requires recognition of lifetime expected credit losses through an allowance account at the time the security is purchased. 
 The following table presents a rollforward by major security type of the ACL on the Company's HTM debt securities: 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 Balance, December 31, 2021 Provision for Credit Losses Charge-offs Recoveries Balance, December 31, 2022 (in millions) Held-to-maturity debt securities Tax-exempt 
 Year Ended December 31, 2021: Balance, December 31, 2020 Recovery of Credit Losses Charge-offs Recoveries Balance December 31, 2021 (in millions) Held-to-maturity debt securities Tax-exempt ) 
 No allowance has been recognized on the Company's HTM private label residential MBS as losses are not expected due to the Company holding a senior position in these securities. 
 Accrued interest receivable on HTM securities totaled million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is excluded from the estimate of expected credit losses.

 Troubled Debt Restructurings 
 A TDR loan is a loan on which the Company, for reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that the Company would not otherwise consider. The loan terms that have been modified or restructured due to a borrower s financial situation include, but are not limited to, a reduction in the stated interest rate, an extension of the maturity or renewal of the loan at an interest rate below current market, a reduction in the face amount of the debt, a reduction in the accrued interest, or deferral of interest payments. The majority of the Company's modifications are extensions in terms or deferral of payments which result in no lost principal or interest. Consistent with regulatory guidance, a TDR loan that is subsequently modified in another restructuring agreement but has shown sustained performance and classification as a TDR, will be removed from TDR status provided that the modified terms were market-based at the time of modification.

 A TDR loan is deemed to have a payment default when it becomes past due 90 days under the modified terms, goes on nonaccrual status, or is restructured again. Payment defaults, along with other qualitative indicators, are considered by management in the determination of the ACL. During the year ended December 31, 2022, there were no loans for which there was a payment default within 12 months following the modification. During the year ended December 31, 2021, there was commercial and industrial loan with a recorded investment of million for which there was a payment default within 12 months following the modification, which resulted in a charge-off of million.

 The following table presents the effect of hypothetical changes in the fair value of MSRs caused by assumed immediate changes in interest rates, discount rates, and prepayment speeds that are used to determine fair value: 
 December 31, 2022 (in millions) Fair value of mortgage servicing rights Increase (decrease) in fair value resulting from: Interest rate change of 50 basis points Adverse change ) Favorable change Discount rate change of 50 basis points Increase ) Decrease Conditional prepayment rate change of 1 Increase ) Decrease Cost to service change of 10 Increase ) Decrease 
 Sensitivities are hypothetical changes in fair value and cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of changes in assumptions to changes in fair value may not be linear. In addition, the offsetting effect of hedging activities are not contemplated in these results and further, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption is calculated without changing any other assumptions, whereas a change in one factor may result in changes to another. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that actual results would be consistent with the results of these estimates. As a result, actual future changes in MSR values may differ significantly from those reported.

 Derivatives Not Designated in Hedge Relationships 
 Management enters into certain foreign exchange derivative contracts, back-to-back interest rate contracts, and risk participation agreements which are not designated as accounting hedges. Foreign exchange derivative contracts include spot, forward, forward window, and swap contracts. The purpose of these derivative contracts is to mitigate foreign currency risk on transactions entered into, or on behalf of customers. Contracts with customers, along with the related derivative trades that the Company places, are both remeasured at fair value, and are referred to as economic hedges since they economically offset the Company's exposure. The Company's back-to-back interest rate contracts are used to allow customers to manage long-term interest rate risk. Risk participation agreements are entered into with lead banks in certain loan syndications to share in the risk of default on interest rate swaps on the participated loan. 
 As it relates to the Company's mortgage banking business, it also uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to interest rate risk related to IRLCs, and its inventory of loans HFS and MSRs. The Company economically hedges the changes in fair value associated with changes in interest rates generally by utilizing forward sale commitments and interest rate futures.

 For the Company's derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings in the same line item as the offsetting loss or gain on the related interest rate swaps. For loans, the gain or loss on the hedged item is included in interest income and for subordinated debt, the gain or loss on the hedged items was included in interest expense, as shown in the table below.

 Counterparty Credit Risk 
 Like other financial instruments, derivatives contain an element of credit risk. This risk is measured as the expected replacement value of the contracts. Management enters into bilateral collateral and master netting agreements that provide for the net settlement of all contracts with the same counterparty. Additionally, management monitors counterparty credit risk exposure on each contract to determine appropriate limits on the Company's total credit exposure across all product types, which may require the Company to post collateral to counterparties when these contracts are in a net liability position and conversely, for counterparties to post collateral to the Company when these contracts are in a net asset position. Management reviews the Company's collateral positions on a daily basis and exchanges collateral with counterparties in accordance with standard ISDA documentation and other related agreements. The Company generally posts or holds collateral in the form of cash deposits or highly rated securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or government-sponsored enterprises, such as GNMA, FNMA, and FHLMC. At December 31, 2022, and 2021 collateral pledged by the Company to counterparties for its derivatives totaled 11 million and 80 million, respectively.

 There was not a significant change in the effective tax rate from 2021 to 2022. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2020 to 2021 is primarily due to increases in pretax book income and state taxes associated with the AmeriHome acquisition which were not fully offset by growth in permanent tax benefit items for the year.

 At December 31, 2022, the net DTA balance totaled million, an increase of million from million at December 31, 2021. The overall increase in the net DTA was primarily attributable to a decrease in the fair market value of AFS securities, an increase to expected tax credit carryovers, and an increase to the ACL. Although realization is not assured, the Company believes that the realization of the recognized net DTA of million at December 31, 2022 is more-likely-than-not based on expectations as to future taxable income and based on available tax planning strategies that could be implemented if necessary to prevent a carryover from expiring. 
 The Company had deferred tax valuation allowance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company s gross federal NOL carryovers, all of which are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the IRC, totaled million, for which a DTA of million has been recorded, reflecting the expected benefit of these federal NOL carryovers remaining after application of the Section 382 limitation. The Company does not currently have any remaining state NOL carryovers. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in various states. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, or local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2018. 
 When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that most positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the period in which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet along with any associated interest and penalties payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.

The Company does not anticipate resolution of any unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. 
 During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, amounts were recognized for interest and penalties and as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there was no accrual for penalties and interest. 
 LIHTC and renewable energy projects 
 The Company holds ownership interests in limited partnerships and limited liability companies that invest in affordable housing and renewable energy projects. These investments are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal tax credits and deductions. The limited liability entities are considered to be VIEs; however, as a limited partner, the Company is not the primary beneficiary and is not required to consolidate these entities. 
 Investments in LIHTC and renewable energy totaled million and million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Unfunded LIHTC and renewable energy obligations are included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and totaled million and million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, million, million, and million of amortization related to LIHTC investments was recognized as a component of income tax expense, respectively.

 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer provided that there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The Company enters into credit arrangements that generally provide for the termination of advances in the event of a covenant violation or other event of default. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the party. The commitments are collateralized by the same types of assets used as loan collateral. 
 The Company has exposure to credit losses from unfunded commitments and letters of credit. As funds have not been disbursed on these commitments, they are not reported as loans outstanding. Credit losses related to these commitments are included in Other liabilities as a separate loss contingency and are not included in the ACL reported in "Note 5. Loans, Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses" of these Consolidated Financial Statements. This loss contingency for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit was million and million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Changes to this liability are adjusted through the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Income Statement.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, CRE related loans accounted for approximately of total loans. Approximately 16 and 13 of the Company's CRE investor portfolio consisted of office loans as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These office loans are primarily shorter-term bridge loans that enable borrowers to reposition or redevelop projects and are geographically well diversified, with the vast majority located in midtown or suburban locations. At the time of origination, these loans have an initial loan-to-value ratio of less than 55 and a weighted average loan-to-cost of less than 60 . The properties underlying these loans have stable business trends and low vacancy rates. Substantially all of the Company's remaining CRE loans are secured by first liens with an initial loan-to-value ratio of generally not more than . Approximately and of these CRE loans, excluding construction and land loans, were owner-occupied as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. No borrower relationships at both the commitment and funded loan level exceeded 5 of total loans HFI as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

 Fair value on a recurring basis 
 Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include the following: 
 AFS debt securities: Securities classified as AFS are reported at fair value utilizing Level 1 and Level 2 inputs. For these securities, the Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include quoted prices in active markets, dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information, and the bond s terms and conditions, among other things. 
 Equity securities: Preferred and common stock and CRA investments are reported at fair value primarily utilizing Level 1 inputs. 
 Independent pricing service: The Company's independent pricing service provides pricing information on the majority of the Company's Level 1 and Level 2 AFS debt securities. For a small subset of securities, other pricing sources are used, including observed prices on publicly-traded securities and dealer quotes. Management independently evaluates the fair value measurements received from the Company's third-party pricing service through multiple review steps. First, management reviews what has transpired in the marketplace with respect to interest rates, credit spreads, volatility, and mortgage rates, among other things, and develops an expectation of changes to the securities' valuations from the previous quarter. Then, management selects a sample of investment securities and compares the values provided by its primary third-party pricing service to the market values obtained from secondary sources, including other pricing services and safekeeping statements, and evaluates those with notable variances. In instances where there are discrepancies in pricing from various sources and management expectations, management may manually price securities using currently observed market data to determine whether they can develop similar prices or may utilize bid information from broker dealers. Any remaining discrepancies between management's review and the prices provided by the vendor are discussed with the vendor and/or the Company's other valuation advisors. 
 Loans HFS : Government-insured or guaranteed and agency-conforming loans HFS are salable into active markets. Accordingly, the fair value of these loans is based on quoted market or contracted selling prices or a market price equivalent, which are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
 The fair value of EBO loans, non-agency loans, and loans that are delinquent or have an underwriting defect are valued using Level 3 inputs since they lack active markets. 
 Mortgage servicing rights : MSRs are measured based on valuation techniques using Level 3 inputs. The Company uses a discounted cash flow model that incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating the fair value of servicing rights, including, but not limited to, option adjusted spread, conditional prepayment rate, servicing fee rate, recapture rate, and cost to service. 
 Derivative financial instruments : Forward purchase and sales contracts are measured based on valuation techniques using Level 2 inputs, such as quoted market price, contracted selling price, or market price equivalent. Interest rate and foreign currency contracts are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. The Company obtains dealer quotations to value its interest rate contracts. IRLCs are measured based on valuation techniques that consider loan type, underlying loan amount, maturity date, note rate, loan program, and expected settlement date, with Level 3 inputs for the servicing release premium and pull-through rate. These measurements are adjusted at the loan level to consider the servicing release premium and loan pricing adjustment specific to each loan. The base value is then adjusted for the pull-through rate. The pull-through rate and servicing fee multiple are unobservable inputs based on historical experience. 
 Junior subordinated debt: The Company estimates the fair value of its junior subordinated debt using a discounted cash flow model which incorporates the effect of the Company s own credit risk in the fair value of the liabilities (Level 3). The Company s cash flow assumptions are based on contractual cash flows as the Company anticipates that it will pay the debt according to its contractual terms.

 Other assets acquired through foreclosure: Other assets acquired through foreclosure consist of properties acquired as a result of, or in-lieu-of, foreclosure. These assets are initially reported at the fair value determined by independent appraisals using appraised value less estimated cost to sell. Such properties are generally re-appraised every 12 months. Costs relating to the development or improvement of the assets are capitalized and costs relating to holding the assets are charged to expense. 
 Fair value is determined, where possible, using market prices derived from an appraisal or evaluation, which are considered to be Level 2. However, certain assumptions and unobservable inputs are often used by the appraiser, therefore qualifying the assets as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. When significant adjustments are based on unobservable inputs, such as when a current appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, the resulting fair value measurement has been categorized as a Level 3 measurement. The Company had million and million of such assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

 Interest rate risk 
 The Company assumes interest rate risk (the risk to the Company s earnings and capital from changes in interest rate levels) as a result of its normal operations. As a result, the fair values of the Company s financial instruments, as well as its future net interest income, will change when interest rate levels change and that change may be either favorable or unfavorable to the Company. 
 Interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the Company's change in EVE and net interest income resulting from hypothetical changes in interest rates. If potential changes to EVE and net interest income resulting from hypothetical interest rate changes are not within the limits established by the BOD, the BOD may direct management to adjust the asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within BOD-approved limits. 
 WAB has an ALCO charged with managing interest rate risk within the BOD-approved limits. Limits are structured to preclude an interest rate risk profile that does not conform to both management and BOD risk tolerances without ALCO approval. There is also ALCO reporting at the Parent level for reviewing interest rate risk for the Company, which gets reported to the BOD and its Finance and Investment Committee. 
 Fair value of commitments 
 The estimated fair value of letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021 approximates zero as there have been no significant changes in borrower creditworthiness. Loan commitments on which the committed interest rates are less than the current market rate are insignificant at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

 With the acquisition of AmeriHome, the Company is also required to maintain specified levels of capital to remain in good standing with certain government sponsored entities and government agencies, including FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA, and HUD. These capital requirements are generally tied to the unpaid balances of loans included in the Company's servicing portfolio or loan production volume. Noncompliance with these capital requirements can result in various remedial actions up to, and including, removing the Company's ability to sell loans to and service loans on behalf of the respective agency.

 25. REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS 
 Revenue streams within the scope of ASC 606 include service charges and fees, interchange fees on credit and debit cards, success fees, and legal settlement service fees. 
 Performance Obligations 
 Many of the services the Company performs for its customers are ongoing, and either party may cancel at any time. The fees for these contracts are dependent upon various underlying factors, such as customer deposit balances, and as such may be considered variable. The Company s performance obligations for these services are satisfied as the services are rendered and payment is collected on a monthly, quarterly, or semi-annual basis. For services provided at a point in time, fees are recognized at the time such services are rendered. The Company had no material unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31, 2022 or 2021. 
 Service Charges and Fees 
 The Company performs deposit account services for its customers, which include analysis and treasury management services, use of safe deposit boxes, check upcharges, and other ancillary services. The depository arrangements the Company holds with its customers are considered day-to-day contracts with ongoing renewals and optional purchases, and as such, the contract duration does not extend beyond the services performed. Due to the short-term nature of such contracts, the Company generally recognizes revenue for deposit related fees as services are rendered. From time to time, the Company may waive certain fees for its customers. The Company considers historical experience when recognizing revenue from contracts with customers, and may reduce the transaction price to account for fee waivers or refunds. 
 Debit and Credit Card Interchange 
 When a credit or debit card issued by the Company is used to purchase goods or services from a merchant, the Company earns an interchange fee. Interchange fees on credit and debit cards are included in Commercial banking related income in the Consolidated Income Statements. The Company considers the merchant to be its customer in these transactions as nightly settlement services between the payment network and the merchant are being provided to the merchant. This transmission of data and funds represents the Company s performance obligation and is performed nightly. As the payment network is in direct control of setting the rates, the Company acts as an agent. Interchange fees are recorded net of expenses as the services are provided. 
 Success Fees 
 Success fees are one-time fees detailed as part of certain loan agreements and are earned upon occurrence of a triggering event. Examples of triggering events include: a borrower obtaining its next round of funding, an acquisition, or completion of a public offering. Success fees are variable as the transaction price can vary and is contingent on the occurrence or non-occurrence of a triggering event. These fees are included in Income from equity investments in the Consolidated Income Statements. 
 Legal Settlement Services 
 The Company provides payment services for claim administrators responsible for distributing funds from legal settlements, such as class action lawsuits. Claimants access the Company's platform, select their preferred method of payment, and funds are transferred to the claimant. Upon the transfer of funds, the Company is entitled to a fee paid by the claim administrator. Revenue is recognized upon each transfer of funds to a claimant. 
 Revenues within the scope of ASC 606 totaled million, million, and million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

 MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 The management of WAL is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company s CEO and CFO to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 As of December 31, 2022, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the COSO in 2013.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Western Alliance Bancorporation 
 Opinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited Western Alliance Bancorporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 of the Company and our report, dated February 23, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
