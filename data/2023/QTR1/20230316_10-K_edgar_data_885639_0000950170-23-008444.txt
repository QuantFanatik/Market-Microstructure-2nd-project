 Kohl s Corporation (the Company, Kohl s, we, our, or us was organized in 1988 and is a Wisconsin corporation. As of January 28, 2023, we operated 1,170 Kohl's stores and a website (www.Kohls.com). Our Kohl's stores and website sell moderately-priced private and national brand apparel, footwear, accessories, beauty, and home products. Our Kohl's stores generally carry a consistent merchandise assortment with some differences attributable to local preferences, store size, and Sephora. Our website includes merchandise which is available in our stores, as well as merchandise that is available only online. 
 Our merchandise mix includes both national brands and private brands that are available only at Kohl's. Our private portfolio includes well-known established brands such as Croft Barrow, Jumping Beans, SO, Sonoma Goods for Life, and Tek Gear, and exclusive brands that are developed and marketed through agreements with nationally-recognized brands such as Food Network, LC Lauren Conrad, Nine West, and Simply Vera Vera Wang. Compared to national brands, private brands generally have lower selling prices, but higher gross margins. 
 The following tables summarize our net sales penetration by line of business and brand type over the last three years:

 Distribution 
 We receive substantially all of our merchandise at our nine retail distribution centers and six e-fulfillment centers. A small amount of our merchandise is delivered directly to the stores by vendors or their distributors. The retail distribution centers, which are strategically located throughout the United States, ship merchandise to each store by contract carrier several times a week. Digital sales may be picked up in our stores or are shipped to the customer from a Kohl s e-fulfillment center, retail distribution center or store, or directly by a third-party vendor. 
 See Item 2, Properties, for additional information about our distribution and e-fulfillment centers. 
 Human Capital 
 At Kohl s, our purpose is to inspire and empower families to lead fulfilled lives. We are committed to creating a culture where everyone belongs, where diversity and inclusion drive innovation and business results, while enabling associates and customers to be their authentic selves every single day. 
 Employee Count 
 During 2022, we employed an average of approximately 97,000 associates, which included approximately 36,000 full-time and 61,000 part-time associates. The number of associates varies during the year, peaking during the back-to-school and holiday seasons. None of our associates are represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe we maintain positive relations with our associates. 
 Health, Safety, and Wellness 
 We lead initiatives that ensure the way we communicate, work, and develop our product enables our customers and associates to shop, work, and engage in a safe environment. W e have a team dedicated to defining plans and preparing for business crisis events, including natural disasters and other unplanned disruptions like those brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. To keep a healthy workforce, we maintain an advocacy program that provides associates with 24/7 access to medical professionals following a work accident. We continue to pursue innovative ways to educate our teams on safety. Associates at our stores, distribution, and e-fulfillment centers receive specialized training to enhance our safety culture and reduce associate accidents. 
 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
 At Kohl s, we are committed to our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion DEI strategy focused on Our People, Our Customers, and Our Community. This strategy accelerates how we are embedding DEI throughout our business by being intentional about our programs and practices and holding ourselves accountable with measurable goals and results. The work is rooted in our Core Beliefs: 
 We believe embedding diversity, equity, and inclusion in everything we do requires an ongoing journey of listening, learning, and taking action. 

We believe that human and civil rights, anti-racism, and our commitment to nondiscrimination in any form are critical to upholding our core values, ethical practices, and Code of Ethics. 

We believe we can create lasting change by addressing inequities to positively affect our people, customers, and community. 

We believe we are accountable for inspiring empathy, creating an environment of belonging, and identifying and addressing bias. 

We are committed to creating an environment where diversity is valued at all levels, everyone feels a sense of equity, and where inclusion is evident across our business. We strive to be purposeful in attracting, growing, and engaging more diverse talent while giving associates equitable opportunities for career growth. We administer our recruiting

 Table of Contents 
 
 efforts with a focus on education, training, and sourcing strategies for increasing our diverse talent pipeline. Our diversity and inclusion strategy is embedded into our onboarding for all associates. We endeavor to drive economic prosperity through conversations, programs, and partnerships that improve quality of life. 
 We are focused on growing diverse leaders by engaging top and emerging talent in internal and external professional development offerings. Diversity is embedded within our organizational planning for the future, with diversity being an area of consideration during succession planning. We are working to develop inclusive leaders through programs aimed at building awareness and encouraging advocacy. 
 In the space of continuous development and engagement, we have eight Business Resource Groups BRGs with approximately 20,000 members focused on driving the business by recognizing and championing DEI in its multiple forms. BRG s continue to be leveraged and seen as the culture keepers to support honest and reflective dialogue and accelerate the company forward in inclusion and belonging. The BRG s are also positioned to provide key development and growth opportunities for associates to build their cache of skills and connections while bringing their authentic selves to their work and the organization. The BRGs serve as champions for enhancing our diversity and inclusion efforts across our business and make an impact across the organization with a focus on our three diversity and inclusion pillars. We work to provide learning opportunities for our leaders and associates to build a more diverse and inclusive workforce and engage associates on how that creates a competitive advantage. 
 At Kohl's, we believe our leaders are accountable for strengthening, modeling, and supporting our DEI efforts by ensuring that they are building a culture and environment where our associates feel seen, and their unique needs, experiences, abilities, and perspectives are valued and heard. Each leader is responsible for creating a caring culture and experience for our team, one that embraces and strives to understand our differences, and provides an inclusive environment for all. 
 Compensation and Benefits 
 We are committed to providing competitive and fair compensation and benefits programs to our associates. All eligible associates receive a 100 match (up to 5 of pay) in Kohl s 401(k) Savings Plan after one year of employment. Full-time associates are offered medical, dental, vision, prescription drug, disability and life insurance coverage, paid time off, and a merchandise discount. Part-time associates are offered dental, vision, supplementary life insurance, and a merchandise discount. We empower our associates work-life balance by giving them access to a full range of professional resources. 
 Training and Development 
 Behind our success are great teams of talented individuals who embody our values. We actively attract, engage, and hire talent who drive our purpose. Our talent management team brings together performance management, talent assessment, succession planning, and career planning. This team provides tools, resources, and best practices to ensure we have the right talent in the right roles at the right time. We invest in executive coaching, assessments, internal programs, external courses, peer networks, and more. 
 From initial onboarding to high potential leadership development, we believe in training and career growth for our associates. We continue to leverage new technologies and encourage our associates to keep their skills fresh through our learning management system, which includes more than 1,000 online and in-person courses. We are committed to the highest standards of integrity and maintain a Code of Ethics to guide ethical decision-making for associates. We require associates to take annual ethics training, which is refreshed each year to cover relevant topics. 
 Competition 
 The retail industry is highly competitive. Management considers style, quality, price, and convenience to be the most significant competitive factors in the industry. Merchandise mix, brands, service, loyalty programs, credit availability, 
 5 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 and customer experience are also key competitive factors. Our primary competitors are traditional department stores, mass merchandisers, off-price retailers, specialty stores, internet businesses, and other forms of retail commerce. Our specific competitors vary from market to market. 
 Merchandise Vendors 
 We purchase merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign suppliers. All suppliers must meet certain requirements to do business with us. Our Terms of Engagement are part of our purchase order terms and conditions and include provisions regarding laws and regulations, employment practices, ethical standards, environmental requirements, communication, monitoring and compliance, record keeping, subcontracting, and corrective action. We expect that all suppliers will comply with our purchase terms and quickly remediate any deficiencies, if noted, to maintain our business relationship. 
 A third-party purchasing agent sources approximately 20 of the merchandise we sell. No vendor individually accounted for more than 10 of our net purchases in 2022. We have no significant long-term purchase commitments with any of our suppliers and believe that we are not dependent on any one supplier or one geographical location. We believe we have good working relationships with our suppliers. 
 Seasonality 
 Our business, like that of other retailers, is subject to seasonal influences. Sales and income are typically higher during the back-to-school and holiday seasons. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. 
 Trademarks and Service Marks 
 KOHL'S is a registered trademark owned by one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. This subsidiary has over 200 additional registered trademarks, most of which are used in connection with our private brand products. 
 We consider the KOHL'S mark, all other trademarks, and the accompanying goodwill to be valuable to our business.

 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements made within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as believes, anticipates, plans, may, intends, will, should, expects, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include the statements under management's discussion and analysis, financial and capital outlook and may include comments about our future sales or financial performance and our plans, performance and other objectives, expectations or intentions, such as statements regarding our liquidity, debt service requirements, planned capital expenditures, future store initiatives, and adequacy of capital resources and reserves. Forward-looking statements are based on management s then current views and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. As such, forward-looking statements are qualified by those risk factors described below. Forward-looking statements relate to the date made, and we undertake no obligation to update them. 
 Our sales, revenues, gross margin, expenses, and operating results could be negatively impacted by a number of factors including, but not limited to those described below. Many of these risk factors are outside of our control. If we are not successful in managing these risks, they could have a negative impact on our sales, revenues, gross margin, expenses, and/or operating results. 
 Macroeconomic and Industry Risks 
 General economic conditions, consumer spending levels, and/or other conditions could decline. 
 Consumer spending habits, including spending for the merchandise that we sell, are affected by many factors including prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, prevailing interest rates, housing costs, energy and fuel costs, income tax rates and policies, consumer confidence, consumer perception of economic conditions, and the consumer s disposable income, credit availability, and debt levels. The moderate-income consumer, which is our core customer, is especially sensitive to these factors. A slowdown in the U.S. economy or an uncertain economic outlook could adversely affect consumer spending habits. As all of our stores are located in the United States, we are especially susceptible to deteriorations in the U.S. economy. 
 Consumer confidence is also affected by the domestic and international political situation. The outbreak or escalation of war, or the occurrence of terrorist acts or other hostilities in or affecting the United States, could lead to a decrease in spending by consumers. 
 Our competitors could make changes to their pricing and other practices. 
 The retail industry is highly competitive. We compete for customers, associates, locations, merchandise, services, and other important aspects of our business with many other local, regional, and national retailers. Those competitors include traditional department stores, mass merchandisers, off-price retailers, specialty stores, internet businesses, and other forms of retail commerce. 
 We consider style, quality, price, and convenience to be the most significant competitive factors in our industry. The continuing migration and evolution of retailing to digital channels has increased our challenges in differentiating ourselves from other retailers especially as it relates to national brands. In particular, consumers can quickly and conveniently comparison shop with digital tools, which can lead to decisions based solely on price. Unanticipated changes in the pricing and other practices of our competitors may adversely affect our performance and lead to loss of market share in one or more categories.

 Tax, trade and climate, and other ESG-related policies and regulations could change or be implemented and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 Uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs, and government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries has recently increased. The majority of goods sourced are manufactured outside of the United States, primarily in Asia. Major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the imposition of tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and liquidity. Furthermore, increased governmental focus on climate change and other ESG matters may result in complex regulatory requirements that may directly or indirectly have a significant impact on the costs of our operations, including energy, resources used to produce our products and compliance costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 The impact of future outbreaks of COVID-19 or future pandemics could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 The impact of and actions taken in response to COVID-19 had a significant impact on the retail industry generally and our business specifically, starting in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. Further outbreaks of COVID-19 or future pandemics could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Risks Relating to Revenues 
 On March 20, 2020, we temporarily closed our stores nationwide, and were fully reopened as of July 2020. In connection with the store closures, we temporarily furloughed store and store distribution center associates, as well as some corporate office associates whose work was significantly reduced by the store closures. Due to the store closures, we experienced a temporary material decline in revenue and operating cash flow. We cannot predict if further outbreaks or future pandemics would necessitate store closures again. 
 Our response to future outbreaks or pandemics may also impact our customer loyalty. If our customer loyalty is negatively impacted or consumer discretionary spending habits change, our market share and revenue may suffer as a result. To the extent any such outbreak or pandemic significantly impacts spending or payment patterns of our private label credit card holders, we may receive lower fees from our private label credit card program. 
 Risks Relating to Operations 
 If we are unable to attract and retain associates in the future, we may experience operational challenges. These risks related to our business, financial condition, and results of operations, were especially heightened given the uncertainty as to the extent and duration of COVID-19 s impact and could be again during any future outbreak or pandemic. We may also face demands or requests from our associates for additional compensation, healthcare benefits, or other terms as a result of a future outbreak or pandemic that could increase costs, and we could experience labor disputes or disruptions as we implement our mitigation plans. 
 Our mitigation plans may require a large investment of time and focus. To the extent these measures are ineffective or perceived as ineffective, it may harm our reputation and customer loyalty and make our customers less likely to shop in our stores. 
 Our corporate office associates may work remotely in a hybrid work environment, posing operational risks, including heightened cybersecurity risks that may continue past the time when our associates return to work. We cannot predict if further outbreaks or new variants would necessitate corporate office closures again. 
 In addition, we cannot predict the impact that future outbreaks or pandemics may have on our suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, and each of their financial conditions; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us.

 Table of Contents 
 
 Risks Relating to Liquidity 
 Future outbreaks or pandemics may require us to take actions to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility similar to those we took in 2020. These actions may have a negative effect on our credit ratings, access to capital, and the cost and terms of debt financing, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. 
 Future outbreaks or pandemics could also cause or aggravate other risk factors that we identify in this section, which in turn could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, any such outbreaks or pandemics may also affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Operational Risks 
 We may be unable to offer merchandise that resonates with existing customers and attracts new customers as well as successfully manage our inventory levels. 
 Our business is dependent on our ability to anticipate fluctuations in consumer demand for a wide variety of merchandise. Failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns, and other lifestyle decisions could create inventory imbalances and adversely affect our performance and long-term relationships with our customers. Additionally, failure to accurately predict changing consumer tastes may result in excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns and adversely affect our operating results. As with most retailers, we also experience inventory shrinkage due to theft or damage. Higher rates of inventory shrinkage or increased security or other costs to combat inventory shrinkage could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and our efforts to contain or reduce inventory shrinkage may not be successful. 
 We may be unable to source merchandise in a timely and cost-effective manner. 
 A third-party purchasing agent sources approximately 20 of the merchandise we sell. The remaining merchandise is sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. Our ability to find qualified vendors and access to brands or products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge which is typically even more difficult for goods sourced outside the United States, substantially all of which are shipped by ocean to ports in the United States. Political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, pandemic outbreaks, work stoppages, port strikes, port congestion and delays, and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control and have or could continue to adversely impact our performance and cause us to pay more to obtain inventory or result in having the wrong inventory at the wrong time. 
 Increases in the price of merchandise, raw materials, fuel, and labor, or their reduced availability, increase our cost of merchandise sold. The price and availability of raw materials may fluctuate substantially, depending on a variety of factors, including demand, weather, supply conditions, transportation costs, energy prices, work stoppages, government regulation and policy, economic climates, market speculation, and other unpredictable factors. An inability to mitigate these cost increases, unless sufficiently offset with our pricing actions, might cause a decrease in our operating results. Any related pricing actions might cause a decline in our sales volume. Additionally, a reduction in the availability of raw materials could impair the ability to meet production or purchasing requirements in a timely manner. Both the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel, and labor may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs as well as those of our suppliers. 
 If any of our significant vendors were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership, or similar proceedings, we may be unable to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts, transactions, or business relationships on terms as favorable as current terms, which could adversely affect our sales and operating results.

 Table of Contents 
 
 Our vendors may not adhere to our Terms of Engagement or to applicable laws. 
 A substantial portion of our merchandise is received from vendors and factories outside of the United States. We require all of our suppliers to comply with all applicable local and national laws and regulations and our Terms of Engagement for Kohl's Business Partners. These Terms of Engagement include provisions regarding laws and regulations, employment practices, ethical standards, environmental and legal requirements, communication, monitoring/compliance, record keeping, subcontracting, and corrective action. From time to time, suppliers may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable laws. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more suppliers could have a negative impact on our reputation and our results of operations. 
 Our marketing may be ineffective. 
 We believe that differentiating Kohl's in the marketplace is critical to our success. We design our marketing and loyalty programs to increase awareness of our brands and to build personalized connections with new and existing customers. We believe these programs will strengthen customer loyalty, increase the number and frequency of customers that shop our stores and website, and increase our sales. If our marketing and loyalty programs are not successful or efficient, our sales and operating results could be adversely affected. 
 The reputation and brand image of Kohl s and the brands and products we sell could be damaged. 
 We believe the Kohl's brand name and many of our private brand names are powerful sales and marketing tools. We devote significant resources to develop, promote, and protect private brands that generate national recognition. In some cases, the private brands or the marketing of such brands are tied to or affiliated with well-known individuals. We also associate the Kohl s brand with third-party national brands that we sell in our store and through our partnerships with companies in pursuit of strategic initiatives. Further, we focus on ESG as a key component of our strategy, and we have made regular public disclosures on our ESG efforts. For example, we publish an annual ESG report to share information with our partners, shareholders, customers, and associates regarding our ESG progress. These disclosures reflect our goals and other expectations and assumptions, which are necessarily uncertain and may not be realized. At the same time, investor and other stakeholder expectations, and voluntary and regulatory ESG disclosure standards and policies continue to evolve. Damage to the reputations (whether or not justified) of the Kohl s brand, our private brand names, or any affiliated individuals or companies with which we have partnered, could arise from product failures; concerns about human rights, working conditions, and other labor rights and conditions where merchandise is produced; perceptions of our pricing and return policies; litigation; vendor violations of our Terms of Engagement; perceptions of the national vendors and/or third party companies with which we partner; failure to realize our ESG goals on a timely basis or at all; failure to meet evolving investor and other stakeholder expectations with respect to ESG matters; or various other forms of adverse publicity, especially in social media outlets. This type of reputational damage may result in a reduction in sales, operating results, and shareholder value. 
 There may be concerns about the safety of products that we sell. 
 If our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, experience increased costs, and/or be exposed to legal and reputational risk. Events that give rise to actual, potential, or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action and/or private litigation. Reputational damage caused by real or perceived product safety concerns could have a negative impact on our sales and operating results. 
 We may be unable to adequately maintain and/or update our information systems. 
 The efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information systems. In particular, we rely on our information systems to effectively manage sales, distribution, and merchandise planning and allocation functions. We also generate sales through the operations of our Kohls.com website. We frequently make investments that will help 
 10 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 maintain and update our existing information systems. We also depend on third parties as it relates to our information systems. The potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives, the failure of our information systems to perform as designed, or the failure to successfully partner with our third party service providers, such as our cloud platform providers, could disrupt our business and harm our sales and profitability. 
 Our information technology projects may not yield their intended results. 
 We regularly have internal information technology projects in process. Although the technology is intended to increase productivity and operating efficiencies, these projects may not yield their intended results or may deliver an adverse user or customer experience. We may incur significant costs in connection with the implementation, ongoing use, or discontinuation of technology projects, or fail to successfully implement these technology initiatives, or achieve the anticipated efficiencies from such projects, any of which could adversely affect our operations, liquidity, and financial condition. 
 Weather conditions and natural disasters could adversely affect consumer shopping patterns and disrupt our operations. 
 A significant portion of our business is apparel and is subject to weather conditions. As a result, our operating results may be adversely affected by severe or unexpected weather conditions (including those that may be caused by climate change). Frequent or unusually heavy snow, ice, or rain storms; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, fires, and hurricanes; or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures could adversely affect our performance by affecting consumer shopping patterns and diminishing demand for seasonal merchandise. In addition, these events could cause physical damage to our properties or impact our supply chain, making it difficult or impossible to timely deliver seasonally appropriate merchandise. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, our mitigation strategies may be inadequate to address such a major disruption event. 
 We may be unable to successfully execute an omnichannel strategy. 
 Customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are evolving. Customers are increasingly using technology and mobile devices to rapidly compare products and prices, and to purchase products. Once products are purchased, customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products. We must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process. Our ability to compete with other retailers and to meet our customers' expectations may suffer if we are unable to provide relevant customer-facing technology and omnichannel experiences. Our ability to compete may also suffer if Kohl s, our suppliers, or our third-party shipping and delivery vendors are unable to effectively and efficiently fulfill and deliver orders, especially during the holiday season when sales volumes are especially high. Consequently, our results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 Our business is seasonal in nature, which could negatively affect our sales, revenues, operating results, and cash requirements. 
 Our business is subject to seasonal influences, with a major portion of sales and income historically realized during the second half of the fiscal year, which includes the back-to-school and holiday seasons. 
 If we do not adequately stock or restock popular products, particularly during the back-to-school and holiday seasons, we may fail to meet customer demand, which could affect our revenue and our future growth. If we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs, which could reduce profitability. Underestimating customer demand, or failing to timely receive merchandise to meet demand, can lead to inventory shortages and missed sales opportunities, as well as negative customer experiences. 
 We have and may continue to experience an increase in costs associated with shipping digital orders due to complimentary upgrades, split shipments, freight surcharges due to peak capacity constraints, and additional 
 11 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our website within a short period of time, we may experience system interruptions that make our website unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. Also, third-party delivery and direct ship vendors may be unable to deliver merchandise on a timely basis. 
 This seasonality causes our operating results and cash needs to vary considerably from quarter to quarter. Additionally, any decrease in sales or profitability during the second half of the fiscal year could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 Changes in credit card operations could adversely affect our sales, revenues, and/or profitability. 
 Our credit card operations facilitate merchandise sales and generate additional revenue from fees related to extending credit. The private Kohl's credit card accounts are owned by an unrelated third-party, but we share in the net risk-adjusted revenue of the portfolio, which is defined as the sum of finance charges, late fees, and other revenue less write-offs of uncollectible accounts. Changes in funding costs related to interest rate fluctuations are shared similar to the revenue when interest rates exceed defined amounts. Though management currently believes that increases in funding costs will be largely offset by increases in finance charge revenue, increases in funding costs could adversely impact the profitability of this program. 
 Changes in credit card use and applications, payment patterns, credit fraud, and default rates may also result from a variety of economic, legal, social, and other factors that we cannot control or predict with certainty. Changes that adversely impact our ability to extend credit and collect payments could negatively affect our results. 
 We may be unable to attract, develop, and retain quality associates while controlling costs, which could adversely affect our operating results. 
 Our performance is dependent on attracting and retaining a large number of quality associates, including our senior management team and other key associates. Many associates are in entry-level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. Many of our strategic initiatives require that we hire and/or develop associates with appropriate experience. Our staffing needs are especially high during the holiday season. Competition for these associates is intense. We cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods. 
 Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as government benefits, unemployment levels and labor participation rates, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, actions by our competitors in compensation levels, potential labor organizing efforts, and changing demographics. Competitive and regulatory pressures have already significantly increased our labor costs. Further changes that adversely impact our ability to attract and retain quality associates could adversely affect our performance and/or profitability. In addition, changes in federal and state laws relating to employee benefits, including, but not limited to, sick time, paid time off, leave of absence, minimum wage, wage-and-hour, overtime, meal-and-break time, and joint/co-employment could cause us to incur additional costs, which could negatively impact our profitability. 
 Capital Risks 
 We may be unable to raise additional capital or maintain bank credit on favorable terms, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. 
 We have historically relied on the public debt markets to raise capital to partially fund our operations and growth. We have also historically maintained lines of credit with financial institutions. In January 2023, we upsized our unsecured credit facility with a 1.5 billion senior secured, asset based revolving credit facility. Changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity, and interest rate fluctuations may increase the cost of financing 
 12 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 or restrict our access to these potential sources of future liquidity. Our continued access to these liquidity sources on favorable terms depends on multiple factors, including our operating performance and debt ratings. During 2022, our credit ratings were reduced below investment grade, which resulted in an increase in the interest rate on a portion of our long-term debt. Further downgrades would cause our cost of borrowing to further increase. Declines in our credit ratings may also adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets and the terms and our cost of funds for new debt issuances. If our credit ratings were to be further downgraded, or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our credit rating levels, our industry, or our Company, our access to capital and the cost of debt financing may be negatively impacted. Additionally, if unfavorable capital market conditions exist if and when we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis (if at all). The terms of current and future debt agreements could restrict our business operations or cause future financing to be unavailable due to our covenant restrictions then in effect. Also, if we are unable to comply with the covenants under our revolving credit facility, the lenders under that agreement will have the right to terminate their commitments thereunder and declare the outstanding loans thereunder to be immediately due and payable. A default under our revolving credit facility could trigger a cross-default, acceleration, or other consequences under other indebtedness or financial instruments to which we are a party. If our access to capital was to become significantly constrained or our cost of capital was to increase significantly our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
 Our capital allocation could be inefficient or ineffective. 
 Our goal is to invest capital to maximize our overall long-term returns. This includes spending on inventory, capital projects and expenses, managing debt levels, and periodically returning value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. To a large degree, capital efficiency reflects how well we manage our other key risks. The actions taken to address other specific risks may affect how well we manage the more general risk of capital efficiency. If we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns, we may fail to produce optimal financial results, and we may experience a reduction in shareholder value. 
 Legal and Regulatory Risks 
 Regulatory and legal matters could adversely affect our business operations and change financial performance. 
 Various aspects of our operations are subject to federal, state, or local laws, rules, and regulations, any of which may change from time to time. The costs and other effects of new or changed legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty. For example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent such requirements increase prices of goods and services, reduce the availability of raw materials, or further restrict our ability to extend credit to our customers. 
 We continually monitor the state and federal legal and regulatory environments for developments that may impact us. Failure to detect changes and comply with such laws and regulations may result in an erosion of our reputation, disruption of business, and/or loss of associate morale. Additionally, we are regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise out of the conduct of our business. Litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. 
 Our efforts to protect the privacy and security of sensitive or confidential customer, associate, or company information could be unsuccessful, which could severely damage our reputation, expose us to risks of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations, and harm our business. 
 As part of our normal course of business, we collect, retain, process, and transmit sensitive and confidential customer, associate, and company information. We also engage third-party vendors that provide technology, systems, and services to facilitate our collection, retention, processing, and transmission of this information. It is possible that our 
 13 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 facilities and systems and those of our third-party vendors are vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, security breaches, system failures, acts of vandalism, fraud, misappropriation, malware, ransomware, and other malicious or harmful code, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, insider threats, or other similar events. The ever-evolving and increasingly sophisticated methods of cyber-attack may be difficult or impossible to anticipate and/or detect. Any data security incident involving the breach, misappropriation, loss, or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive and/or confidential information, whether by us or our vendors, could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and customers' willingness to shop in our stores or on our website, violate applicable laws, regulations, orders and agreements, and subject us to additional costs and liabilities which could be material. In addition, the regulatory environment related to data privacy and cybersecurity is constantly changing, with new and increasingly demanding requirements applicable to our business. Maintaining our compliance with those requirements, including recently enacted state consumer privacy laws, may increase our compliance costs, require changes to our business practices, limit our ability to use and collect data, impact our customers shopping experience, reduce our business efficiency, and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or data breach litigation.

 Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our stores and digital channel by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. Comparable sales includes all store and digital sales, except sales from stores open less than 12 months, stores that have been closed, and stores that have been relocated where square footage has changed by more than 10 . We measure the change in digital sales by including all sales initiated online or through mobile applications, including omnichannel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores. 
 We measure digital penetration as digital sales over net sales. These amounts do not take into consideration fulfillment node, digital returns processed in stores, and coupon behaviors. 
 Comparable sales and digital penetration measures vary across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable sales calculation and digital penetration are non-GAAP measures that may not be consistent with the similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
 The following graph summarizes net sales dollars and comparable sales over the prior year. As our stores were closed for a period during 2020, we have not included a discussion of 2020 or 2021 comparable sales as we do not believe it is a meaningful metric over this period of time. 

2022 compared to 2021 
 Net sales decreased 1.3 billion, or (7.1 ), to 17.2 billion for 2022. 
 The decrease in net sales was driven by lower sales in both stores and digital as a result of lower traffic. The impact of a higher average ticket was offset by lower units per transaction. 

Digital sales decreased 7 for the year. Digital penetration represented 32 of net sales in 2022. 

Men's, Women's, and Accessories, which includes Sephora, outperformed the Company average. 

Other Revenue 
 Other revenue includes revenue from credit card operations, third-party advertising on our website, unused gift cards and merchandise return cards (breakage), and other non-merchandise revenue. 
 21 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 The following graph summarizes other revenue: 

Other revenue decreased 25 million in 2022. The decrease in 2022 was driven by a decrease in credit revenue due to lower overall accounts receivable balances and a normalizing loss rate. 
 On March 14, 2022, we amended and restated our private label credit card program agreement with Capital One. The agreement ends on March 31, 2030. The agreement will operate in substantially the same manner as it currently operates, and with planned modernization of technology and processes. 
 Cost of Merchandise Sold and Gross Margin 
 Cost of merchandise sold includes the total cost of products sold, including product development costs, net of vendor payments other than reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs; inventory shrink; markdowns; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers; shipping expenses for digital sales; and terms cash discount. Our cost of merchandise sold may not be comparable with that of other retailers because we include distribution center and buying costs in selling, general, and administrative (SG A) expenses while other retailers may include these expenses in cost of merchandise sold. 
 The following graph summarizes cost of merchandise sold and gross margin as a percent of net sales: 

Gross margin is calculated as net sales less cost of merchandise sold. Gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased 485 basis points in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease in gross margin was driven by increased permanent markdowns taken to address inventory levels, elevated freight, and headwinds from product cost inflation and higher shrink. 
 22 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 We expect gross margin to stabilize in 2023 and to be in the 36.0 to 36.5 range. We expect the promotional environment to remain competitive, but expect progressive benefits as freight and product cost inflation moderate in the second half of the year. 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 
 SG A includes compensation and benefit costs (including stores, corporate, buying, and distribution centers); occupancy and operating costs of our retail, distribution, and corporate facilities; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise from our distribution centers to our retail stores and among distribution and retail facilities other than expenses to fulfill digital sales; marketing expenses, offset by vendor payments for reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs; expenses related to our credit card operations; and other administrative revenues and expenses. We do not include depreciation and amortization in SG A. The classification of these expenses varies across the retail industry. 
 Many of our expenses, including store payroll and distribution costs, are variable in nature. These costs generally increase as sales increase, and decrease as sales decrease. We measure both the change in these variable expenses and the expense as a percent of revenue. If the expense as a percent of revenue decreased from the prior year, the expense leveraged . If the expense as a percent of revenue increased over the prior year, the expense deleveraged . 
 The following graph summarizes the changes in SG A by expense type between 2021 and 2022: 

SG A increased 109 million, or 2.0 , to 5.6 billion for 2022. As a percentage of revenue, SG A deleveraged by (268) basis points. 
 The increase was primarily driven by an increase in stores as we made strategic investments in our stores to support the approximately 400 Sephora shop-in-shop openings this year compared to the 200 openings last year as well as increased wages. Technology was driven by higher investment in new technology initiatives. Distribution costs, which exclude payroll related to online originated orders that were shipped from our stores, were 457 million for 2022 compared to 449 million for 2021. Partially offsetting the increases were savings across our credit, marketing, and corporate areas. 
 23 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 In 2023, SG A dollars are expected to deleverage slightly, with wage inflation continuing to be a headwind, offset by benefits from a more efficient organization structure, and fewer Sephora openings in 2023.

Depreciation and amortization decreased in 2022, driven by reduced capital spending in technology. 
 Net interest expense increased in 2022 compared to 2021 due to more financing leases as well as borrowings under the revolving credit facility. This was partially offset by less interest expense in the first quarter of 2022 due to the debt reductions in 2021. 
 In 2021, we completed a cash tender offer and recognized a loss of 201 million from the extinguishment of debt.

 We believe the adjusted results in the GAAP to Non-GAAP table are useful because they provide enhanced visibility into our results for the periods excluding the impact of certain items such as those included in the table. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace the comparable GAAP measures. 
 Inflation 
 We expect that our operations will continue to be influenced by general economic conditions, including food, fuel, and energy prices, higher unemployment, wage inflation, and costs to source our merchandise, including tariffs. There can be no assurances that such factors will not impact our business in the future. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Capital Allocation 
 Our capital allocation strategy is to invest to maximize our overall long-term return, maintain a strong balance sheet, and achieve an investment grade rating. We follow a disciplined approach to capital allocation based on the following priorities: first we invest in our business to drive long-term profitable growth; second we pay a quarterly dividend; and third we return excess cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program. In addition, when appropriate, we will complete debt reduction transactions. 
 We are committed to rebuilding our cash balances and reducing leverage to our long term target of 2.5 times utilizing an eight times cash rent calculation for lease obligations. We will continue to invest in the business, as we plan to invest 600 to 650 million in 2023, including the expansion of the Sephora arrangement and store refresh activity, and we remain committed to the dividend. On February 21, 2023, our Board of Directors of Kohl's Corporation declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.50 per share. The dividend will be paid on March 29, 2023 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2023. We replaced and upsized the revolver in January 2023 to enhance our liquidity and flexibility and will utilize it to fund working capital as well as retire bonds as they become due, with the goal of reducing the debt portfolio. We retired the 164 million of notes due in February 2023, and plan on retiring the 111 million of notes due December 2023 when they mature. We are not planning any share repurchases until our balance sheet is strengthened on a path towards the long term target leverage ratio of 2.5 times. 
 Our period-end cash and cash equivalents balance decreased to 153 million from 1.6 billion in 2021. Our cash and cash equivalents balance includes short-term investments of 10 million and 1.5 billion as of January 28, 2023, and January 29, 2022, respectively. Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. This policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short-term instruments. We also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments.

Operating Activities 
 Our operating cash outflows generally consist of payments to our employees for wages, salaries and other employee benefits, payments to our merchandise vendors for inventory (net of vendor allowances), payments to our shipping carriers, and payments to our landlords for rent. Operating cash outflows also include payments for income taxes and interest payments on our debt borrowings. 
 Operating activities generated cash of 282 million in 2022 compared to 2.3 billion in 2021. Operating cash flow decreased primarily due to lower net income and a decrease in accounts payable due to late arriving receipts in 2021. Additionally in 2021 we received a tax refund related to the net loss we incurred in 2020 and the carryback provision under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security CARES Act. 
 Investing Activities 
 Our investing cash outflows include payments for capital expenditures, including investments in new and existing stores, improvements to supply chain, and technology costs. Our investing cash inflows are generally from proceeds from sales of property and equipment. 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased 213 million to 783 million in 2022. The increase was primarily driven by in-store investments related to Sephora shop-in-shop build-outs, store refreshes, and other customer experience and sales driving enhancements. 
 The following chart summarizes capital expenditures by major category: 
 
 In 2022, we opened 406 full size Sephora-branded retail shop-in-shops and now have a total of 606 full size Sephora shop-in-shops open. In 2023, we are planning to open at least 250 full size and 50 small format Sephora 
 26 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 shop-in-shops. In 2023, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately 600 to 650 million to support the Sephora shop-in-shops and store refresh activity. We will continue to invest in enhancing our omni-channel capabilities. 
 Financing Activities 
 Our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets. We also strive to maintain a balanced portfolio of debt maturities, while minimizing our borrowing costs. Our ability to access the public debt market has provided us with adequate sources of liquidity. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and maintaining strong credit ratings. 
 In September 2022, Standard Poor's downgraded our credit rating from BBB- to BB+. Additionally, in December 2022, Moody's downgraded our credit rating from Baa2 to Ba2. 
 As of January 28, 2023, our credit ratings and outlook were as follows: 

Moody s 
 Standard Poor s 
 Fitch 

Long-term debt 
 Ba2 
 BB+ 
 BBB- 

Outlook 
 Stable 
 Stable 
 Stable 

As a result of Standard Poor's downgrade, the interest rate on our 3.375 notes and 9.50 notes increased 25 bps due to the coupon adjustment provisions within these notes. Additionally, Moody's downgrade will increase the interest rate on these two notes an additional 50 bps in May 2023 due to the coupon adjustment provisions within these notes. If our credit ratings are lowered further, our ability to access the public debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same. 
 The majority of our financing activities include repurchases of common stock, proceeds and/or repayments of long-term debt, and dividend payments. Financing cash outflows also include payments to our landlords for leases classified as financing leases and financing obligations. 
 Financing activities used 933 million in 2022 compared to 2.4 billion in 2021. The decrease is driven by a reduction of treasury stock purchases in 2022 compared to 2021 as well as debt reduction activities in 2021 as discussed below. 
 In March 2021, we issued 500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.375 notes with semi-annual interest payments beginning in November 2021. The notes include coupon rate step ups if our long-term debt is downgraded to below a BBB- credit rating by S P Global Ratings or Baa3 by Moody s Investors Service, Inc, both of which occurred in 2022. The notes mature in May 2031. 
 In April 2021, we completed a cash tender offer for 1.0 billion of senior unsecured debt. We recognized a 201 million loss on extinguishment of debt in the first quarter of 2021, which includes the 192 million tender premium paid to tendering note holders in accordance with the terms of the tender offer, a 6 million non-cash write-off of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts associated with the extinguished debt, and 3 million in other fees. 
 In January 2023, we entered into a Credit Agreement with various lenders which provides for a 1.5 billion senior secured, asset based revolving credit facility that will mature in January 2028 and replaced our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The revolver is secured by substantially all of our assets other than real estate, and contains customary events of default and financial, affirmative, and negative covenants, including but not limited to, a springing financial covenant related to our fixed charge coverage ratio and restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, asset dispositions, and restricted payments. Outstanding borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on SOFR plus the applicable margin. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility, recorded as short-term debt, has 85 million outstanding as of January 28, 2023, and approximately 1.4 billion 
 27 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 remains available under the revolver. No amounts were outstanding at January 29, 2022 under our previous credit agreement. 
 We purchased treasury stock of 658 million in 2022 compared to 1.4 billion in 2021. 158 million of the 2022 purchases were made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan adopted in November 2021. Share repurchases are discretionary in nature. The timing and amount of repurchases are based upon available cash balances, our stock price, and other factors. On August 18, 2022, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase ASR pursuant to the previously announced share repurchase program, with Goldman Sachs Co. LLC Goldman Sachs to repurchase 500 million of the Company's common stock. On August 22, 2022, we received an initial delivery of 11.8 million shares of common stock, representing 80 of the total shares expected to be repurchased under the ASR. Final settlement occurred on November 7, 2022 with an additional 6.1 million shares of common stock being delivered, resulting in a total of 17.9 million shares with an average price of approximately 28 per share. 
 Cash dividend payments were 239 million 2.00 per share) in 2022 and 147 million 1.00 per share) in 2021. 
 Free Cash Flow 
 We had negative free cash flow of 639 million for 2022 compared to 1.6 billion free cash flow generated in 2021. The decrease is primarily due to less operating cash flow due to a net loss as well as increased capital expenditures to support the investments related to Sephora shop-in-shop build-outs, store refreshes, and other customer experience and sales driving enhancements. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure which we define as net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from financing obligations (which generally represent landlord reimbursements of construction costs) less capital expenditures and finance lease and financing obligation payments. Free cash flow should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other financial measures such as net income and net cash provided by operating activities. We believe that free cash flow represents our ability to generate additional cash flow from our business operations.

Changes in earnings drove changes in our return on investment ratio. 
 We believe that Adjusted ROI is a useful financial measure in evaluating our operating performance. When analyzed in conjunction with our net earnings and total assets, it provides investors with a useful tool to evaluate our ongoing operations and our management of assets from period to period. Adjusted ROI is a non-GAAP financial measure which we define as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and rent EBITDAR adjusted for certain one-time items divided by adjusted average gross investment. Adjusted EBITDAR is a useful non-GAAP measure that excludes items that are non-operating in nature and focuses on items that are key to our operating performance. Our Adjusted ROI calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted ROI should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other GAAP financial measures. See the key financial ratio calculations below for our Adjusted ROI calculation.

Adjusted debt to EBITDAR is a non-GAAP financial measure which we define as our adjusted outstanding debt balance divided by EBITDAR. The increase in our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio is primarily due to lower operating income. Our current goal is to achieve a ratio that demonstrates our commitment to an investment grade rating and allows us to operate with an efficient capital structure for our size, growth plans, and industry. Our adjusted debt to EBITDAR calculation may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted debt to EBITDAR should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other GAAP financial measures.

 Debt Covenant Compliance 
 Our senior secured, asset based revolving credit facility contains customary events of default and financial, affirmative and negative covenants, including but not limited to, a springing financial covenant relating to our fixed charge coverage ratio and restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, asset dispositions, and restricted payments. As of January 28, 2023, we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance during 2023. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of long-term debt and related interest payments, principal and interest payments for leases, and other purchase obligations. See Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for amounts outstanding on January 28, 2023 related to debt and leases. 
 Other purchase obligations primarily include royalties, legally binding minimum lease and interest payments for stores opening in 2023 or later, as well as payments associated with technology, marketing, and donation agreements. The obligations were 608 million as of January 28, 2023. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have not provided any financial guarantees as of year-end fiscal 2022. 
 We have not created, and are not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt, or operating our business. We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, or capital resources. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. Management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 
 Retail Inventory Method and Inventory Valuation 
 The majority of our merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method RIM ). Under RIM, the valuation of inventory at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventory. RIM is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality. The use of RIM will result in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market since permanent markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories. A reserve is recorded if the future estimated selling price is less than cost. 
 RIM inherently requires management judgment and estimates, such as the amount and timing of permanent markdowns to clear unproductive or slow-moving inventory, which may impact the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margin. Factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise, fashion trends, and weather conditions. 
 Inventory shrinkage is estimated as a percent of sales for the period between the last physical inventory count and the balance sheet date. Shrink is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. We perform an annual physical inventory count at the majority of our stores, E-Commerce fulfillment centers, and distribution centers. The shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory, in combination with current events and historical experience, is used as the standard for the shrinkage accrual rate for the next inventory cycle. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable.

 Vendor Allowances 
 We frequently receive allowances from our vendors for markdowns that we have taken in order to sell the vendors' merchandise and/or to support gross margins earned on those sales. This markdown support generally relates to sold inventory or permanent markdowns and, accordingly, is reflected as a reduction to cost of merchandise sold. Markdown support related to merchandise that has not yet been sold is recorded in inventory. 
 We also receive support from vendors for marketing and other costs that we have incurred to sell the vendors merchandise. To the extent the reimbursements are for specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell the vendor's products and do not exceed the costs incurred, they are recognized as a reduction of Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. If these criteria are not met, the support is recorded in inventory and reflected as a reduction of costs of merchandise sold when the related merchandise is sold. 
 Insurance Reserve Estimates 
 We are primarily self-insured for costs related to workers compensation, general liability, and employee-related health care benefits. We use a third-party actuary to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks. The actuary considers historical claims experience, demographic and severity factors, health care trends, and actuarial assumptions to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks. Historically, our actuarial estimates have not been materially different from actual results. 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 We review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances, such as decisions to close a store or significant cash flow losses, indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. All long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually. 
 If our evaluations, which are performed on an undiscounted cash flow basis, indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of the impaired asset. 
 Identifying impaired assets and quantifying the related impairment loss, if any, requires significant estimates by management. The most significant of these estimates is the cash flow expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. When determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual store, management estimates future store performance including sales, gross margin, and controllable expenses, such as store payroll and occupancy expense. Projected cash flows must be estimated for future periods throughout the remaining life of the property, which may be as many as 40 years in the future. The accuracy of these estimates will be impacted by a number of factors including general economic conditions, changes in competitive landscape, and our ability to effectively manage the operations of the store. 
 Income Taxes 
 We regularly evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit for income tax positions we have taken in various federal and state filings by considering all relevant facts, circumstances, and information available to us. If we believe it is more likely than not that our position will be sustained, we recognize a benefit at the largest amount which we believe is cumulatively greater than 50 likely to be realized. 
 Unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits, and our particular facts and circumstances. Also, as audits are completed or statutes of limitations lapse, it may be necessary to record adjustments to our taxes payable, deferred tax assets, tax reserves, or income tax expense. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain 
 32 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. Income taxes are further described in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Leases 
 Accounting for leased properties requires compliance with technical accounting rules and significant judgment by management. Application of these accounting rules and assumptions made by management will determine if the lease is accounted for as a finance lease, an operating lease, or a financing obligation. 
 The following are significant estimates used by management in accounting for real estate and other leases: 
 Accounting lease term Our accounting lease term includes all noncancelable periods and renewal periods that are reasonably assured of being exercised. Typically, renewal options are considered reasonably assured of being exercised if we have made significant leasehold improvements that would exceed the initial or renewal lease term and the cash flow performance of the store remains strong. The expected lease term is used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a finance lease. 

Incremental borrowing rate The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that the lessee would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. The incremental borrowing rate is used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a finance lease. 

Fair market value of leased asset The fair market value of leased retail property is generally estimated based on comparable market data as provided by third-party appraisers or consideration received from the landlord. Fair market value is used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a finance lease. 

Leases are further described in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Sephora Arrangement 
 In 2020, we entered into an arrangement with Sephora to be the exclusive beauty offering at Kohl's and bring a transformational, elevated beauty experience to Kohl s. We sell prestige beauty products through Sephora-branded retail shop-in-shops in certain Kohl s stores and through a Sephora-branded offering on Kohls.com. We have opened 606 full size shop-in shops to date and are planning to open at least 250 full size and 50 small format Sephora shop-in-shops in 2023. 
 Both parties to the arrangement are active participants and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the success of the activities of the arrangement. The arrangement involves various activities including the merchandising, marketing, and operations of the shops and Kohls.com. Kohl s is the principal on sales transactions with our customers and we recognize sales, cost of merchandise sold, and operating expenses in the respective lines on our consolidated statements of operations. Kohl s owns and manages the inventory and funds capital expenditures for the arrangement. The parties share equally in the operating profit of the arrangement which incorporates all expenses to run the arrangement including depreciation expense related to the assets. Amounts due to Sephora for their share of the operating profits are recorded in cost of merchandise sold. 
 Item 7A. Quantitative and Quali tative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Our operating results are subject to interest rate risk as the 600 million of notes issued in April 2020, 113 million of which remain outstanding, and the 500 million of notes issued in March 2021 include coupon rate step ups if our long-term debt is downgraded to below a BBB- credit rating by S P Global Ratings or Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., both of which occurred in 2022. All other long-term debt is at fixed interest rates and, therefore, is not 
 33 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 affected by changes in interest rates. When our long-term debt instruments mature, we may refinance them at the existing market interest rates, which may be more or less than interest rates on the maturing debt. 
 We share in the net risk-adjusted revenue of the Kohl s credit card portfolio as defined by the sum of finance charges, late fees, and other revenue less write-offs of uncollectible accounts. We also share the costs of funding the outstanding receivables as interest rates exceed defined rates. As a result, our share of profits from the credit card portfolio may be negatively impacted by increases in interest rates. The reduced profitability, if any, will be impacted by various factors, including our ability to pass higher funding costs on to the credit card holders and the outstanding receivable balance, and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

 Report Of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Kohl s Corporation 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Kohl s Corporation (the Company) as of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 28, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 28, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 16, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Description of the Matter 
 
 Merchandise Inventories At January 28, 2023, the Company s merchandise inventories balance was 3.2 billion. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method RIM ). Under RIM, the valuation of inventory at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventory. RIM is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality. The use of RIM results in inventory valued at lower of cost or market since permanent markdowns are taken as a reduction to the retail value of inventories. The calculation of inventory under RIM includes a number of inputs including the retail value of inventory and adjustments to inventory costs such as markdown allowances, shrinkage and permanent markdowns. As a result of the number of inputs and the involvement of multiple software applications used to capture the high volume of transactions processed by the Company, auditing inventory requires extensive audit effort. In addition, the inventory process is supported by a number of automated and IT dependent controls that elevate the importance of the IT general controls that support the underlying software applications including those developed by the Company. 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 
 We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s inventory process, including the RIM calculation and underlying IT general controls, and controls over the data transfers between applications. Our substantive audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the key inputs into the RIM calculation, including purchases, sales, shrinkage, vendor allowances and markdowns. Our testing included agreeing data back to source information including third party vendor invoices, third party inventory count information, and cash receipts. We also performed analytical procedures including margin analysis, analytics with respect to key inventory metrics such as shrinkage, turns and store inventory in conjunction with analysis related to markdowns and purchase price adjustments. 

Unrecognized Tax Benefits 

Description of the Matter 
 
 As described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, at January 28, 2023, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of 219 million. The Company s uncertain tax positions are subject to audit by federal and state taxing authorities, and the resolution of such audits may span multiple years. Management s analysis of extent to which its tax positions in certain jurisdictions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained was significant to our audit because the amounts are material to the financial statements and the related assessment process is complex and involves significant judgments. Such judgments included the interpretation of laws, regulations, and tax rulings related to uncertain tax positions.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 
 We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s process to assess whether tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination. For example, we tested controls over management s identification of uncertain tax positions and its application of the recognition and measurement principles, including management s review of the inputs and calculations of unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions. To test management s recognition and measurement of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluation of the status of open income tax examinations and the potential implications of those examinations on the current year income tax provision based on the application of income tax laws. We analyzed the Company s assumptions and data used to determine the amount of tax benefit to recognize and tested the accuracy of the calculations. We also tested the technical merits of existing positions, including an evaluation of whether the positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained in an examination and the statute of limitations assumptions related to the Company s calculation of liabilities for uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax professionals to assist in the evaluation of tax law relative to the Company s open income tax examinations and changes from prior years.

We record reserves for workers compensation and general liability claims which include the total amounts that we expect to pay for a fully developed loss and related expenses, such as fees paid to attorneys, experts, and investigators. We are fully self-insured for employee-related health care benefits, a portion of which is paid by our associates. We use a third-party actuary to estimate the liabilities associated with workers compensation, general liability, and employee-related health care risks. These liabilities include amounts for both reported claims and incurred, but not reported losses. The total liabilities, net of collateral held by third parties, for these risks were million as of January 28, 2023 and million as of January 29, 2022. For property losses, we are subject to a million self-insured retention SIR ). Once the SIR is incurred, each loss is subject to a deductible, except for flooding in high hazard zones which is subject to a million deductible, and catastrophic events, such as earthquakes and windstorms, which are subject to a - deductible.

Net Sales 

We maintain various rewards programs where customers earn rewards based on their spending and other promotional activities. The rewards are typically in the form of dollar-off discounts which can be used on future purchases. These programs create performance obligations which require us to defer a portion of the original sale until the rewards are redeemed. 

 Sales are recorded net of returns. We record a reserve based on historical return rates and patterns which reverses sales that we expect to be returned in the following period. 

 Revenue from the sale of Kohl's gift cards is recognized when the gift card is redeemed. During each of the fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, net sales of million, million, and million, respectively, were recognized from gift cards redeemed during the current year and issued in prior years. 

 Net sales do not include sales tax as we are considered a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting sales taxes. 

 Other Revenue Other revenue includes revenue from credit card operations, third-party advertising on our website, unused gift cards and merchandise return cards (breakage), and other non-merchandise revenue. Revenue from credit card operations includes our share of the finance charges, late fees, and other revenue less write-offs of uncollectible accounts of the Kohl s credit card pursuant to the Private Label Credit Card Program Agreement. Expenses related to our credit card operations are reported in Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Revenue from unredeemed gift cards and merchandise return cards (breakage) is recorded in proportion to and over the time period the cards are actually redeemed.

Our estimated fair value of unsecured senior long-term debt is determined using Level 1 inputs, using financial instruments with unadjusted, quoted prices listed on active market exchanges. The estimated fair value of our unsecured senior debt was billion at January 28, 2023 and billion at January 29, 2022. In September 2022, Standard Poor's downgraded our credit rating from BBB- to BB+. As a result of the downgrade, our notes and notes coupon rates have increased bps due to the coupon step provision within these bonds. Additionally, in December 2022, Moody's downgraded our credit rating from Baa2 to Ba2. As a result of the downgrade, the notes and notes coupon rates will increase another bps in May 2023 due to the coupon step provision within these bonds. In January 2023, we entered into a Credit Agreement with various lenders which provides for a billion senior secured, asset based revolving credit facility that will mature in and replaced our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility. . Outstanding borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on SOFR plus the applicable margin. As of January 28, 2023, we had million of standby and trade letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility, which reduces the available borrowing capacity. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility, recorded as short-term debt, has million outstanding as of January 28, 2023, and approximately billion remains available under the revolver. amounts were outstanding at January 29, 2022 under our previous credit agreement. Our various debt agreements contain covenants including limitations on additional indebtedness and certain financial tests. As of January 28, 2023, we were in compliance with all covenants of the various debt agreements. We also had outstanding standby and trade letters of credit outside of the credit facility totaling approximately million at January 28, 2023.

Lease assets are recognized at commencement date based on the value of the lease liability and are adjusted for any lease payments made to the lessor at or before commencement date, minus any lease incentives received and any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee. Lease liabilities represent our contractual obligation to make lease payments. At the commencement date, the lease liabilities equal the present value of minimum lease payments over the lease term. As the implicit interest rate is not readily identifiable in our leases, we estimate our collateralized incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of lease payments. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are excluded from the balance; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We combine lease and non-lease components for new and modified leases. The majority of our lease assets and liabilities are for stores that are leased locations. We opened full size Sephora shop-in-shops within our Kohl's stores during 2022 and now have open as of the end of the fiscal year. We plan on opening at least more full size shops in 2023. Due to the investments we made in the shop-in-shops, we reassessed our lease term when construction began as these assets will have significant economic value to us when the lease term becomes exercisable. The impact of these assessments resulted in an increase in the accounting lease term, additional lease assets and liabilities, and, in some cases, changes to the classification.

Effective tax rate 

The effective tax rate for the year ended January 28, 2023 was higher than the effective tax rate for the year ended January 29, 2022 because of the impact of favorable results from uncertain tax positions as well as federal tax credits relative to consolidated book net income (loss). The 2020 rate reflects the benefit for the net operating loss carryback provision from the CARES Act enacted on March 27, 2020. We have analyzed filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns, as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions. The federal returns subject to examination are the through tax years. With respect to state and local jurisdictions, with limited exceptions, the Company and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax audits for years before . Certain states have proposed adjustments, which we are currently appealing. If we do not prevail on our appeals, we do not anticipate that the adjustments would result in a material change in our financial position. We assess our income tax positions and record tax liabilities for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts and circumstances and information available at the reporting dates. For those income tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not, based on technical merits, that a tax benefit will be sustained upon the conclusion of an examination, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit having a cumulatively greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority, assuming that it has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those tax positions which do not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold regarding the ultimate realization of the related tax benefit, no tax benefit has been recorded in the financial statements. In addition, we provide for interest and penalties, as applicable, and record such amounts as a component of the overall income tax provision. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 

Increases due to tax positions taken in prior years 

Increases due to tax positions taken in current year 

Decreases due to: 

Tax positions taken in prior years 

Settlements with taxing authorities 

Lapse of applicable statute of limitations 

Balance at end of year 

Included above in the tax positions taken in prior years for 2022 is a reclass between the unrecognized tax benefits and the deferred tax liability; it had no impact on the effective tax rate. Not included in the unrecognized tax benefits reconciliation above are gross unrecognized accrued interest and penalties of million at January 28, 2023 and million at January 29, 2022. Interest and penalty expenses were million in 2022, million in 2021, and million in 2020. Our net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate were million as of January 28, 2023 and million as of January 29, 2022. It is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax positions may change within the next 12 months, primarily as a result of ongoing audits. While it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year, it is not anticipated that a significant impact to the unrecognized tax benefit balance will occur. We have both payables and receivables for income taxes recorded on our balance sheet. Receivables included in other current assets totaled million as of January 28, 2023 and million as of January 29, 2022. Receivables included in other long term assets totaled million as of January 28, 2023 and million as of January 29, 2022. The majority of the receivable balance relates to the cash benefit of the 2020 net operating loss that has not yet been received. Payables included in current liabilities totaled million as of January 28, 2023 and million as of January 29, 2022. 

 million shares authorized and million shares available for grant under the 2017 Long-Term Compensation Plan. Options and nonvested stock that are surrendered or terminated without issuance of shares are available for future grants. We also have outstanding awards which were granted under previous compensation plans. Annual grants are typically made in the first quarter of the fiscal year. Grants to newly-hired and promoted employees and other discretionary grants are made periodically throughout the remainder of the year.

In lieu of cash dividends, holders of nonvested stock awards are granted restricted stock equivalents which vest consistently with the underlying nonvested stock awards. Holders of restricted stock units are granted shares upon vesting in lieu of cash dividends. The fair value of nonvested stock awards and units is the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. We may acquire shares from employees in lieu of amounts required to satisfy minimum tax withholding requirements upon the vesting of the employee s unvested stock award. Such shares are then designated as treasury shares.

The performance measurement period for these performance share units is three fiscal years. The fair market value of the grants is determined using a Monte-Carlo valuation on the date of grant (Level 3 inputs). The actual number of shares which will be earned at the end of the three-year vesting periods will vary based on our cumulative financial performance over the vesting periods. The number of performance share units earned will be modified up or down based on Kohl's Relative Total Shareholder Return against a defined peer group during the vesting periods. The payouts, if earned, will be settled in Kohl's common stock after the end of each multi-year performance periods.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (the Evaluation at a reasonable assurance level as of the last day of the period covered by this report. 
 Based upon the Evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level. Disclosure controls and procedures are defined by Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving our stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of our published financial statements. 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 
 Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on this assessment, our management has concluded that as of January 28, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. 
 Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of its audit, has issued an attestation report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Kohl s Corporation 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited Kohl s Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Kohl s Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 28, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated March 16, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
