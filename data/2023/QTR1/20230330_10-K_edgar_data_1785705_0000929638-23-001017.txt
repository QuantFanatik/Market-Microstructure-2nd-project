 process for similar instruments.

Item 1117 of Regulation AB. Legal Proceedings.

The following six paragraphs are disclosures received from U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association U.S. Bank Trust Co. ), as successor to U.S. Bank National
 Association, which serves as the indenture trustee and note paying agent under the indenture for the Verizon Owner Trust 2019-C transaction.

U.S. Bank National Association U.S. Bank N.A. has made a strategic decision to reposition its corporate trust business by transferring substantially all of its corporate trust
 business to its affiliate, U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association U.S. Bank Trust Co. ), a non-depository trust company (U.S. Bank N.A. and U.S. Bank Trust Co. are collectively referred to as U.S. Bank ). 

Upon U.S. Bank Trust Co. s succession to the business of U.S. Bank N.A., it has become a wholly owned subsidiary of U.S. Bank N.A.

U.S. Bank N.A. and other large financial institutions have been sued in their capacity as trustee or successor trustee for certain residential mortgage backed securities ("RMBS")
 trusts. The complaints, primarily filed by investors or investor groups against U.S. Bank N.A. and similar institutions, allege the trustees caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and
 servicers to comply with the governing agreements for these RMBS trusts. Plaintiffs generally assert causes of action based upon the trustees purported failures to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of
 representations and warranties, notify securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default.

U.S. Bank N.A. denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of losses to investors, that
 it has meritorious defenses, and it has contested and intends to continue contesting the plaintiffs claims vigorously. However, U.S. Bank N.A. cannot assure you as to the outcome of any of the litigation, or the possible impact of these litigations
 on the trustee or the RMBS trusts.

On March 9, 2018, a law firm purporting to represent fifteen Delaware statutory trusts (the DSTs that issued securities backed by student loans (the Student Loans filed a lawsuit
 in the Delaware Court of Chancery against U.S. Bank N.A. in its capacities as indenture trustee and successor special servicer, and three other institutions in their respective transaction capacities, with respect to the DSTs and the Student Loans. 
 This lawsuit is captioned The National Collegiate Student Loan Master Trust I, et al. v. U.S. Bank National Association, et al. , C.A. No. 2018-0167-JRS (Del. Ch.) (the NCMSLT Action ). The complaint, as
 amended on June 15, 2018, alleged that the DSTs have been harmed as a result of purported misconduct or omissions by the defendants concerning administration of the trusts and special servicing of the Student Loans. Since the filing of the NCMSLT
 Action, certain Student Loan borrowers have made assertions against U.S. Bank N.A. concerning special servicing that appear to be based on certain allegations made on behalf of the DSTs in the NCMSLT Action.

U.S. Bank N.A. has filed a motion seeking dismissal of the operative complaint in its entirety with prejudice pursuant to Chancery Court Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) or, in the
 alternative, a stay of the case while other prior filed disputes involving the DSTs and the Student Loans are litigated. On November 7, 2018, the Court ruled that the case should be stayed in its entirety pending resolution of the first-filed
 cases. On January 21, 2020, the Court entered an order consolidating for pretrial purposes the NCMSLT Action and three other lawsuits pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery concerning the DSTs and the Student Loans, which remains pending.

U.S. Bank N.A. denies liability in the NCMSLT Action and believes it has performed its obligations as indenture trustee and special servicer in good faith and in compliance in all
 material respects with the terms of the agreements governing the DSTs and that it has meritorious defenses. It has contested and intends to continue contesting the plaintiffs claims vigorously.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP ON ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH SERVICING CRITERIA RELATING TO CELLCO PARTNERSHIP

EXHIBIT 34.1

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Cellco Partnership:

We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria for
 Cellco Partnership, that Cellco Partnership Cellco or the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for all publicly issued asset-backed securities
 transactions backed by device payment plan agreements for which Cellco is the servicer (the Platform as of December 31, 2022 and for the year ended December 31, 2022, except for servicing criteria
 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by them with
 respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. See Exhibit A of management s assertion for the asset backed transactions covered by the Platform. Management
 is responsible for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight
 Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our
 examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform and determining whether the Company
 processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria and as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations of the Division of Corporation Finance, Section
 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not
 designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected
 transactions or any other transactions. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We are required to be independent of Cellco Partnership and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our examination
 engagement.

Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria.

As described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(vii) , the
 Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected
 to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by C DI 200.06. As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place
 designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the Securities and Exchange
 Commission s requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06.

In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB,
 including servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(vii) for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above, as of December 31, 2022 and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the Platform, is fairly stated, in all
 material respects.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP ON ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH SERVICING CRITERIA RELATING TO U.S. BANK TRUST COMPANY, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION

EXHIBIT 34.2

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors

 U.S. Bank National Association

We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that U.S. Bank National
 Association and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association (collectively, the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust
 Asset-Backed Securities Platform (the Platform ), for which the Company provides t rustee, securities administration, registrar, paying agent and document custody
 services, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, except for servicing criteria Items 1122(d)(1)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(iv)-(xiv), which the
 Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to
 express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company
 Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
 circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining
 whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by
 the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by
 the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with Items 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(v), and 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB,
 there were no servicing activities performed by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022 that required these servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
 reasonable basis for our opinion.

We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our
 examination engagement.

Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria.

In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, for the U.S.
 Bank Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.
