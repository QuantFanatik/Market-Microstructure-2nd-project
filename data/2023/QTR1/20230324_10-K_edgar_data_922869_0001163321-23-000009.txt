 Item 1117 of Regulation AB Legal Proceedings. 
 Litigation claims and proceedings of all types are subject to many uncertain factors that generally cannot be predicted with assurance. Below we provide a description of certain legal proceedings and claims. 
 Interchange Litigation 
 In 2005, a putative class of retail merchants filed antitrust lawsuits against Mastercard International Mastercard and Visa U.S.A., Inc. Visa and several issuing banks, including Capital One Financial Corporation (the Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Capital One, National Association (the Bank ), seeking both injunctive relief and monetary damages for an alleged conspiracy by defendants to fix the level of interchange fees. Other merchants have asserted similar claims in separate lawsuits, and while these separate cases did not name any issuing banks, Visa, Mastercard and issuing banks, including the Corporation and its subsidiaries, including the Bank, have entered settlement and judgment sharing agreements allocating the liabilities of any judgment or settlement arising from all interchange-related cases. 
 The lawsuits were consolidated before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for certain purposes and were settled in 2012. The class settlement, however, was invalidated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in June 2016, and the suit was bifurcated into separate class actions seeking injunctive and monetary relief, respectively. In addition, numerous merchant groups opted out of the 2012 settlement and have pursued their own claims. The claims by the injunctive relief class have not been resolved, but the settlement of 5.5 billion for the monetary damages class has received final approval from the trial court, and has been appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Visa and Mastercard have also settled a number of the opt-out cases, which required non-material payments from issuing banks, including the Corporation and its subsidiaries, including the Bank. Visa created a litigation escrow account 

following its initial public offering of stock in 2008 that funds settlements for its member banks, and any settlements related to Mastercard-allocated losses have either already been paid or are reflected in the Corporation and its subsidiaries reserves. 
 Capital One, National Association 
 The Corporation and the Bank are commonly subject to various pending and threatened legal actions relating to the conduct of their normal business activities. In the opinion of management, the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of all such other pending or threatened legal actions, is not expected to be material to noteholders. 
 The Bank of New York Mellon 
 In the ordinary course of business, The Bank of New York Mellon is named as a defendant in or made a party to pending and potential legal actions. In connection with its role as trustee of certain residential mortgage-backed securitization RMBS transactions, The Bank of New York Mellon has been named as a defendant in a number of legal actions brought by RMBS investors. These lawsuits allege that the trustee had expansive duties under the governing agreements, including the duty to investigate and pursue breach of representation and warranty claims against other parties to the RMBS transactions. While it is inherently difficult to predict the eventual outcomes of pending actions, The Bank of New York Mellon denies liability and intends to defend the litigations vigorously. 
 The Bank of New York Mellon has provided us with the information under the caption The Bank of New York Mellon immediately above in response to the requirements of Regulation AB. Neither the Corporation nor its subsidiaries (including the Bank) is a party to any such litigation. Other than the information regarding trustee litigation immediately above and the information concerning The Bank of New York Mellon specified in this Form 10-K under the caption Item 1122 of Regulation AB Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria and in Exhibits 33.2 and 34.2 to this Form 10-K, The Bank of New York Mellon has not participated in the preparation of, and is not responsible for, any other information contained in this Form 10-K.

 Item 1122 of Regulation AB Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria. 
 Each of the Bank, for itself, as successor to Capital One Bank (USA), National Association and on behalf of its affiliate Capital One Services, LLC COSL ), and The Bank of New York Mellon (each, a Servicing Participant has been identified by the registrant as a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the pool assets held by each of Capital One Master Trust and Capital One Multi-asset Execution Trust. Each Servicing Participant has completed a report on an assessment of compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to such Servicing Participant (each, a Report on Assessment as of, and for the twelve-month period ended, December 31, 2022, which Reports on Assessment are included as exhibits to this Form 10-K. In addition, each Servicing Participant has provided an attestation report (each, an Attestation Report by a registered independent public accounting firm regarding its related Report on Assessment. Each Attestation Report is attached as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. 
 Vendors 
 A Servicing Participant may engage one or more vendors to perform specific and limited, or scripted activities that address all or a portion of one or more servicing criteria applicable to such Servicing Participant. Generally in these cases, the Servicing Participant has instituted policies and procedures to monitor whether such vendors activities comply in all material respects with such servicing criteria, and may elect to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to such vendors activities in such Servicing Participant s Report on Assessment. Where the Servicing Participant has not instituted such policies and procedures, or where the Servicing Participant does not otherwise elect to take responsibility for assessing its vendors activities, the vendor is itself treated as a Servicing Participant and is required to provide its own Report on Assessment and related Attestation Report. 
 No Report on Assessment or related Attestation Report has identified (i) any material instance of noncompliance with the servicing criteria identified in such Report on Assessment as applicable to the related Servicing Participant or (ii) any material deficiency in such Servicing Participant s policies and procedures to monitor vendor compliance. 
 Platform-Level Reports 
 Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC require that each Servicing Participant complete a Report on Assessment at a platform level, meaning that the transactions covered by the Report on Assessment should include all asset-backed securities transactions involving such Servicing Participant that are backed by the same asset type. Further guidance from the SEC staff identifies additional parameters that a Servicing Participant may apply to define and further limit its platform. For example, a Servicing Participant may define its platform to include only transactions that were completed on or after January 1, 2006 and that were registered with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933. Each Servicing Participant is responsible for defining its own platform, and each platform will naturally differ based on various factors, including the Servicing Participant s business model, the transactions in which it is involved and the range of activities performed in those transactions. 

Based on our understanding of their platforms and the guidance that is available at this time, we believe that the parameters by which the Servicing Participants have defined their platforms should be permissible. However, because the guidance available at this time is subject to clarification or change, we cannot assure you that the SEC and its staff will necessarily agree. 
 Item 1123 of Regulation AB Servicer Compliance Statement. 
 Each of the Bank, for itself and as successor to Capital One Bank (USA), National Association, and COSL has been identified by the registrant as a servicer meeting the criteria of Item 1108(a)(2)(i), (ii) or (iii) of Regulation AB with respect to the pool assets held by each of Capital One Master Trust and Capital One Multi-asset Execution Trust. Each of these servicers has provided a statement of compliance (a Compliance Statement ), which has been signed by an authorized officer of such related servicer. Each Compliance Statement is attached as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.

Exhibit 34.1 
 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 Capital One, National Association 
 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that Capital One, National Association, for itself and as successor to Capital One Bank (USA), National Association COBNA and its affiliate Capital One Services, LLC (together, the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the asset-backed securities transactions involving credit card receivables conducted by Capital One Master Trust and Capital One Multi-asset Execution Trust where the related asset-backed securities were outstanding during the period covered by this report for which the Company acted as servicer (the Platform as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(ii), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(v), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(3)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by them with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. Refer to Appendix A of management s Report on Assessment of Compliance with Servicing Criteria for the asset-backed securities covered by the platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise the platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria and as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations of the Division of Corporation Finance, Section 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C&DI 200.06). Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(xv) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022 that required these servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our examination engagement. 
 
 Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 
 As described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(v) and 1122(d)(4)(iv) as applicable , the Company has engaged a vendor to perform activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria applicable to such vendor as permitted by C&DI 200.06. As permitted by C&DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to such vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C&DI 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s eligibility to apply C&DI 200.06. 
 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB, including servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(v) and 1122(d)(4)(iv) for which compliance is determined based on C&DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

 The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. 
 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria that The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly The Bank of New York), BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware (formerly BNYM (Delaware)) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.), (collectively, the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB (the Servicing Criteria) for the publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting initially required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) asset-backed securities issued on or after January 1, 2006 that are subject to Regulation AB (including transactions subject to Regulation AB by contractual obligation) for which the Company provides trustee, securities administration, paying agent, or custodial services, as defined and to the extent applicable in the transaction agreements, other than residential mortgage-backed securities and other mortgage-related asset-backed securities (the Platform ), except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii), 1122(d)(4)(xiv) and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform (the Servicing Criteria), as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. With respect to Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(4)(i), the Company has determined that for certain transactions in the Platform the Trustor (as such term is defined in the related transaction agreements) may direct the Trustee (as such term is defined in the related transaction agreements) to file, or cause to be filed, all filings identified by the Trustor to be necessary to maintain the effectiveness of any original filings identified by the Trustor to be necessary under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any jurisdiction to perfect the Trustee s security interest in or lien on the Underlying Securities (as such term is defined in the related transaction agreements). Management s Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria indicates that as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company was not instructed by any Trustors to perform such activities. Absent the receipt of instruction from a Trustor to perform such activities, the Company s responsibility for Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(4)(i) for the Platform is solely with regard to the manner of holding trust assets and investment of trust assets in eligible investments and the Company does not have any duties as to the original UCC filing and any continuations to perfect the security interest unless instructed to do so by other parties in the transaction agreement. With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii), the Company has determined that there were no activities performed during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 with respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. Appendix A to Management s Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on our examination. 
 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. 
 
 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the examination engagement. 
 
 As described in the accompanying Management s Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, for Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by this Servicing Criterion. The 
 1 

Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the Servicing Criterion applicable to this vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation (C&DI) 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C&DI 200.06). As permitted by C&DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the Servicing Criterion applicable to the vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C&DI 200.06 for the vendor and related Servicing Criterion as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s eligibility to apply C&DI 200.06. 
 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned Servicing Criteria, including servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi) for which compliance is determined based on C&DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 is fairly stated, in all material respects.
