 BUSINESS. 

We
are a wholly-owned subsidiary of Manhattan Bridge Capital, Inc., a New York corporation MBC ), formed in December 2015,
specifically for the purpose of the public offering of the Notes (described below). On April 25, 2016, we sold 6,000,000 aggregate principal
amount of our 6 Senior Secured Notes, due April 22, 2026 (the Notes ), in our initial public offering IPO ). 

The
Notes are 6 senior secured notes, due April 22, 2026, and have a principal amount of 1,000 each. On April 25, 2016, we issued the Notes
in the IPO in the aggregate principal amount of 6,000,000 under the Indenture, dated April 25, 2016, among ourselves, as the issuer,
MBC, as guarantor, and Worldwide Stock Transfer LLC, as Indenture Trustee (the Indenture ). Interest accrues on the Notes
commencing on May 16, 2016. The accrued interest is payable monthly in cash, in arrears, on the 15 th day of each calendar
month commencing June 2016. The Notes are listed on the NYSE American and trade under the symbol LOAN/26 . 

Under
the terms of the Indenture, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loans held by us, together with our cash on hand,
must always equal at least 120 of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Notes at all times. To the extent the aggregate
principal amount of the mortgage loans owned by us plus our cash on hand is less than 120 of the aggregate outstanding principal balance
of the Notes, we are required to repay, on a monthly basis, the principal amount of the Notes equal to the amount necessary such that,
after giving effect to such repayment, the aggregate principal amount of all mortgage loans owned by us plus, our cash on hand at such
time is equal to or greater than 120 of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes. For this purpose, each mortgage loan is deemed
to have a value equal to its outstanding principal balance, unless the borrower is in default of its obligations. 

We
may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time after April 22, 2019 upon at least 30 days prior written notice to any party holding
a Note (each referred to as a Noteholder and collectively, the Noteholders ). The redemption price will be
equal to the outstanding principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the accrued but unpaid interest thereon up to, but not including,
the date of redemption, without penalty or premium. No Notes were redeemed by the Company as of December 31, 2022. 

Each
Noteholder had the right to cause the Company to redeem his, her or its Notes on April 22, 2021 by notifying the Company in writing,
no earlier than November 22, 2020 and no later than January 22, 2021. No Noteholder exercised such right during the required time frame
and as such the Notes are no longer redeemable by the Noteholders. 

We
are obligated to offer to redeem the Notes if there occurs a change of control with respect to us or MBC or if we or MBC
sell any assets unless, in the case of an asset sale, the proceeds are reinvested in the business of the seller. The redemption price
in connection with a change of control will be 101 of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued but unpaid
interest thereon up to, but not including, the date of redemption. The redemption price in connection with an asset sale will be the
outstanding principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon up to, but not including, the date of redemption. 

Prior
to the consummation of the IPO on April 25, 2016, we did not have any material operations. As of April 2016, we collect payments of interest
on the mortgages we hold and use those funds to make the required interest payments to the holders of the Notes and certain operating
expenses. Any excess cash will be distributed to MBC or held by us, to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. We
currently maintain minimal operations and have no plans to commence any material business operations in the near or long term. 

Our
principal executive officers consist of Assaf Ran, who serves as our Chief Executive Officer and President, and Vanessa Kao, who serves
as our Chief Financial Officer. Each of Mr. Ran and Ms. Kao serve in similar functions with our parent, MBC and own an aggregate of 704,000
and 288,000 of our Notes, respectively.

Available
information 

Our
principal executive offices are located at 60 Cutter Mill Road, Great Neck, New York, 11021 and our telephone number is (516) 444-3400.
We do not currently maintain a website. You may also review and download a copy of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Report ),
including any exhibits and any schedules filed therewith, and our other periodic and current reports, proxy and information statements,
and other information that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), without charge, by visiting the
SEC s website (http://www.sec.gov). In addition, we will voluntarily provide copies of all such reports free of charge upon request. 

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS. 

The
following risk factors, among others, could affect our actual results of operations and could cause our actual results to differ materially
from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and
except as required by law we assume no obligation to update this information. You should carefully consider the risks described below
and elsewhere in this Report before making an investment decision. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be
materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Our Notes are considered speculative, and the trading price of our Notes could decline
due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. The following risk factors are not the only risk factors
facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect
our business. 

We
are controlled by our parent, MBC, which in turn is controlled by our Chief Executive Officer, Assaf Ran, whose interest may not always
be aligned with the interests of the Noteholders. 

Noteholders
will not have any voting rights with respect to us or the right to influence management or day-to-day operations of our business. The
interests of MBC s shareholders who vote may be different or even in opposition of those of creditors such as the Noteholders.
As of the date of this Report, 100 of our issued and outstanding shares are owned by our parent, MBC. In addition, Assaf Ran is a major
owner of the outstanding shares of common stock of MBC. Mr. Ran is also our Chief Executive Officer and our sole director. Thus, Mr.
Ran currently has and will continue to exercise effective control over all of our corporate actions. 

An
active public trading market for the Notes may not develop. 

The
Notes are currently listed on the NYSE American and trade under the symbol LOAN/26 . However, we cannot assure you that
a more active trading market for the Notes will develop. If a more active trading market does not develop you may not be able to sell
your Notes for the price you want at the time you want. The liquidity of any such market will depend upon various factors, including: 

the
 number of Noteholders; 

the
 interest of securities dealers in making a market for the Notes; 

the
 overall market for debt securities; 

our
 financial performance and prospects; and 

the
 prospects for companies in our industry generally. 

We
cannot assure you that you will be able to sell the Notes if you wish to do so or, even if you can sell your Notes that you will recover
your entire investment.

The
Indenture contains restrictive covenants that may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our financial condition.

The
Indenture contains restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our operating flexibility as well as our financial condition. For
example, the Indenture requires us to maintain a specific debt coverage ratio at all times, specifically providing that the aggregate
outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loans held by us, together with our cash on hand, must always equal at least 120 of the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Notes at all times, as well as limits or prohibits our ability to: 

acquire
 or dispose of assets; 

merge
 with another corporation; and 

incur
 additional secured and unsecured indebtedness. 

Our
failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration
of the indebtedness evidenced by the Notes. For example, defaults under the mortgage loans held by us could result in a violation of
the debt coverage ratio covenant. In that case, we are required to make monthly payments of principal on the Notes until such debt coverage
ratio covenant is in compliance. We cannot assure you that in that event we will be able to repay all the Notes in full, or at all. 

The
limited covenants in the Indenture and the terms of the Notes will not provide protection against significant events that could adversely
impact our obligations under the Notes. 

Neither
the Indenture nor the Notes require us to maintain any financial ratios or specific levels of net worth, revenues, income, cash flow
or liquidity and, accordingly, do not protect the Noteholders in the event that we experience significant adverse changes in our financial
condition or results of operations or protect the interest of Noteholders. For example, during the term of the Notes, the true value
of the mortgage loans held by us may fluctuate based on a number of factors including interest rates on the loans relative to prevailing
market rates, as well as the solvency and credit-worthiness of the borrower. However, as long as the borrowers are not in default of
their obligations, we will not be deemed to be in default of the debt coverage ratio covenant in the Indenture. 

We
may not be able to make the required payments of interest and principal on the Notes. 

Our
ability to make payments of principal and interest on the Notes is subject to general economic conditions and financial, business and
other factors affecting our mortgage loan portfolio, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient
funds available when necessary to make any required payments of interest or principal under the Notes, including payments in connection
with a redemption of Notes upon a change of control. Our failure to make payments of interest or principal when due could result in an
event of default and would give the Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders certain rights against us. Our sole source of revenue and cash
flow will be payments of interest and principal we receive with respect to our mortgage loan portfolio. To the extent the interest payments
received by us exceed the payments required to be made to the Noteholders, and both prior to and after giving effect to the distribution
of funds to MBC, we are in compliance with the debt coverage ratio and no default or event of default exists or would occur as a result
of such distribution, we plan to distribute those excess funds to MBC. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service the
debt evidenced by the Notes, we will be in default of its obligations under the Notes. 

We
are not obligated to contribute to a sinking fund to retire the Notes and the Notes are not guaranteed by any governmental agency. 

We
are not obligated to contribute funds to a sinking fund to repay principal or interest on the Notes upon maturity or default. The Notes
are not certificates of deposit or similar obligations of, or guaranteed by, any depositary institution. Further, no governmental entity
insures or guarantees payment on the Notes if we do not have enough funds to make principal or interest payments. 

The
collateral granted as security for our obligations under the Notes may be insufficient to repay the indebtedness upon an event of default.

The
Notes are secured by all of our assets, which consist primarily of mortgage loans and cash. Under the Indenture, the aggregate principal
amount of the mortgage loans held by us plus our cash on hand must equal at least 120 of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes
at all times. We cannot assure you that the value of the collateral will be sufficient to redeem the Notes in full should we be in default
of our payment obligations under the Notes. Specifically, if the mortgage loans are in default, we cannot assure you that we will be
able to sell those loans for an amount equal to or even approximately equal to the outstanding principal balance of the Notes or that
the properties securing the loans in default can be sold for an amount sufficient to fully repay the mortgage loans. Finally, any foreclosure
action is likely to take a considerable amount of time and involve significant costs, further eroding our ability to stay current on
our obligations under the Notes. Because of the foregoing, Noteholders risk the possibility that the collateral securing our obligations
under the Notes may be insufficient to repay those securities upon an event of default. 

5 

Collateral
concentration could lead to significant losses upon an event of default. 

At
December 31, 2022, each of three different borrowers account for more than 10 of the pool of mortgage loans that we purchased from MBC
as security for our obligations under the Notes. At December 31, 2022, loans receivable from one borrower represented 26.3 of total
loans receivable, with nine individuals personally guaranteeing the loan. In addition, loans receivable from one other borrower represented
15.7 of total loans receivable, with two individuals personally guaranteeing the loan. Furthermore, loans receivable from another borrower
represented 13.2 of total loans receivable. Although MBC guarantees all of our obligations under the Notes, concentration of collateral
to a small group of borrowers may pose a significant risk, as a default could have a material adverse impact on our operating results,
cash flow, financial condition and our ability to repay the indebtedness. 

We
have no obligation to redeem the Notes prior to their maturity date except in limited circumstances. 

The
entire outstanding principal balance of the Notes and all accrued but unpaid interest thereon will be due and payable in full on April
22, 2026, the tenth anniversary of the issue date of the Notes. Except for specifically enumerated circumstances, we have no obligation,
and the Noteholders will have no right to require us, to redeem any Notes prior to their maturity date. For example, if either we or
MBC enter into a transaction that constitutes a change in control or an asset sale, as such terms are defined
under the Indenture, we may be obligated to offer to redeem the Notes at a redemption price equal to 101 of their principal amount,
in the case of a change in control and 100 of their principal amount in the case of an asset sale plus,
in either case, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the date of redemption. The existence of a Noteholder s
right to require us to purchase his, her or its Notes upon a change of control may deter a third party from acquiring us in a transaction
that constitutes a change of control. In addition, we have the right, but not the obligation, to redeem the Notes. As a result, any investment
in the Notes should be considered illiquid and unable to be redeemed until their stated maturity. 

We
may not be able to redeem the Notes when we are obligated to do so, which would constitute an event of default. 

In
connection with transactions constituting a change of control or an Asset Sale (as such terms are defined in the Indenture), we may be
obligated to offer to redeem the Notes at a price equal to 101 of their outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, to, but not including, the date of repurchase. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient financial resources available
to satisfy our obligations to redeem the Notes. If we cannot, such failure would constitute an event of default under the Indenture.
In addition, we cannot assure that under such circumstances Noteholders will be able to seek payment from us under the terms of the guaranty
or that Noteholders would be able to sell their Notes. Thus, Noteholders could lose all or a substantial portion of their investment. 

Our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are each critical to our business and our future success may depend on our ability
to retain them. 

Our
future success depends to a significant extent on the continued efforts of our founder, president and Chief Executive Officer, Assaf
Ran, and our Chief Financial Officer, Vanessa Kao. If we are unable to retain qualified personnel in the future, our ability to continue
to operate our business will be impaired.

 MANAGEMENT S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

The
following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with
our audited financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements
based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly
from those projected in such forward-looking statements. 

We
are a wholly-owned subsidiary of Manhattan Bridge Capital, Inc., a New York corporation MBC ), formed in December 2015,
specifically for the purpose of the public offering of the Notes (described below). On April 25, 2016, we sold 6,000,000 aggregate principal
amount of our 6 Senior Secured Notes, due April 22, 2026 (the Notes ), in our initial public offering. The Notes are secured
by a first priority lien on all of our assets, including, primarily, mortgage notes, mortgages and other transaction documents entered
into in connection with first mortgage loans originated and funded by MBC, which we acquired from MBC pursuant to an asset purchase agreement.
The aggregate principal amount of the mortgage loans owned by us plus our cash on hand always must be equal to at least 120 of the outstanding
principal amount of the Notes until the Notes are paid in full. In addition, MBC has guaranteed our obligations under the Notes and has
secured that guaranty with a pledge of all of our outstanding common shares. 

The
Notes are listed on the NYSE American and trade under the symbol LOAN/26 . 

7 

To
the extent any of the mortgages acquired from MBC are satisfied in full, such mortgages will be replaced with one or more mortgages with
similar aggregate principal amount. At December 31, 2022, the pool of mortgage loans was comprised of 14 loans with an aggregate outstanding
principal balance of 7,984,250. 

We
collect payments of interest on the mortgages we hold and use those funds to make the required interest payments to the holders of the
Notes and certain operating expenses. Any excess cash will be distributed to MBC or held by us, to be used for working capital and general
corporate purposes. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Management will base the use of estimates on (a) a preset number of assumptions that consider past experience, (b) future projections,
and (c) general financial market conditions. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates. 

Interest
income from mortgage loans held by us is recognized, as earned, over the loan period. 

We
present deferred financing costs in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the related debt liability rather than an asset, in
accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying
the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the Notes are being amortized over ten years,
using the straight-line method, as the difference between use of the effective interest method is not material. 

Effective
January 1, 2020, MBC adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326). The ASU introduced a new credit loss
methodology, Current Expected Credit Losses CECL ), which requires earlier recognition of credit losses, while also providing
additional transparency about credit risk. MBC estimates its CECL reserve primarily using the Weighted Average Remaining Maturity method,
which requires reference to historic loss data taking into consideration expected economic conditions over the relevant timeframe. In
addition, MBC reviews each loan on a quarterly basis and evaluates the borrower s ability to pay the monthly interest, the borrower s
likelihood of executing the original exit strategy, as well as the loan-to-value ratio. Failure to properly measure an allowance for
credit losses could result in the overstatement of earnings and the carrying value of the loans receivable. Actual losses, if any, could
differ significantly from estimated amounts. 

There
are also areas in which in management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different
result. See our audited financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page F-1 of this Report, which contain accounting policies
and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Results
of Operations 

Years
Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 

Total
Revenue 

Total
revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 of approximately 770,000 and 815,000, respectively, represent interest income
on the secured commercial loans that we purchased from MBC. The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to lower interest rates
charged on such loans due to market conditions at the time the loans were originated or extended. 

Interest
and amortization of deferred financing costs 

Interest
and amortization of deferred financing costs for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 of approximately 435,000 are attributable
to the issuance of the Notes. 

8 

General
and administrative expenses 

General
and administrative expenses for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 of approximately 14,000 are comprised of fees paid
to the Indenture trustee and NYSE American LLC, as well as bank fees. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

At
December 31, 2022, we had cash of approximately 39,000 compared to cash of approximately 61,000 at December 31, 2021. 

Net
cash provided by operating activities was approximately 386,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to approximately 446,000
for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities primarily resulted from the reduction
in revenue and the increase in interest receivable on loans. Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31,
2022 and 2021 primarily resulted from our interest income and amortization of deferred financing costs. 

Net
cash used in financing activities was approximately 408,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to approximately 434,000
for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from the reduction in
net income. Net cash used in financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 reflected advances of excess cash to MBC for
working capital and general corporate purposes. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflected
the repayment of amounts due to MBC in connection with loans purchased from MBC, as well as advances of excess cash to MBC for working
capital and general corporate purposes. Amounts advanced to MBC are non-interest bearing and due on demand. 

We
had no cash from, or used in, investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. 

Under
the terms of the Indenture, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loans held by the Company, together with the
Company s cash on hand, must always equal at least 120 of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Notes at all times. 

We
anticipate that our current cash balances together with our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for
the next 12 months.

 Disclosure
 Controls and Procedures 

Our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022 (the Evaluation Date ). Based upon that
evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls
and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms
and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 Internal
 Control over Financial Reporting 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. As defined by the SEC, internal control over financial reporting is
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of our principal
executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported
by written policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Our
internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurances to our management and the Board regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations
which may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance
with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this
assessment, management used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 

This
Report does not include an attestation report by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent registered
public accounting firm pursuant to rules of SEC that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this Report. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified
in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31,
2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Stockholder and Director 

 MBC
Funding II Corp. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of MBC Funding II Corp. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and
the related statements of operations, changes in stockholder s equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period
ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates. 

Allowance
for Credit Losses 

As
discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company estimates its allowance for credit losses on its loans receivable primarily
using the Weighted Average Remaining Maturity method along with consideration of other variables. Based on these assessments, the Company
determined that no allowance for credit losses is required. 

The
allowance for credit losses was identified by us as a critical audit matter because of the extent of auditor judgment applied and significant
audit effort to evaluate the subjective and complex judgments made by management in determining whether any of its loans receivable are
impaired and/or require an allowance for credit losses. 

Addressing
the critical audit matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with our overall opinion on the
financial statements. These procedures included evaluating the appropriateness of the method and other variables used, testing the application
of the method and other variables used, as well as testing the accuracy of data used with respect to the method and other variables.
These procedures also included, with the assistance of outside valuation specialists, as well as utilization of independent empirical
data, evaluating significant judgments applied by management in determining whether indicators of impairment were present, with respect
to the Company s loan portfolio and the underlying collateral, by obtaining evidence to corroborate such judgments and searching
for evidence contrary to such judgments. 

We
have served as the Company s auditors since 2016.
