GLOSSARY Ad network means an intermediary network or company that acts as a broker between advertisers who want to purchase ad placements and content publishers who want to host the advertiser s ads. Examples of advertisers are consumer good companies, multimedia companies and automobile manufacturers. Publishers in the context are website operators or app developers. Audience Marketplace means the modular, highly scalable, transparent, cloud-based software platform created by the Company for real-time trading of digital, Programmatic Advertising. Bot or internet bot means an autonomous program (or robot) running on a network (usually, the internet) that can interact with computer systems or users. Typically, Bots perform tasks that are both simple and structurally repetitive, at a much higher rate than would be possible for a human alone. According to Imperva, more than half of all web traffic is fraudulent, as it is made up of Bots rather than actual human beings. Brand means a particular name used to identify a type of product or products manufactured by a particular company. Demand Side Platform or DSP means a system that allows buyers of digital advertising space (i.e., advertisers) to manage multiple ad exchange and data exchange accounts through one interface. Full stack means computer engineering that encompasses databases, servers, systems engineering, and clients, across mobile applications, web-based applications and native applications. Latency means the lag time between a customer click on an internet link and the conversion of that customer to a sale. The term can also refer to the lag time between ad inventory s purchase and its display on publisher s media. Omni-channel marketing means marketing that is intended to reach target consumers across all advertising channels mobile, video, desktop, and more within the context of how the specific customer has interacted with a brand (for example, those first seeing an ad about a brand they have never experienced will receive a different message from those who have engaged with that brand a number of times). Programmatic advertising means the purchase of advertising space meant to target audiences using software and tools that help agencies and brands target, deliver, and analyze their digital advertising efforts., rather than the traditional method of purchasing time slots in mass media, such as television programming. Pre-bid means the bid placed by an advertiser for placement of its ad, verified prior to such ad being run or displayed.

Table of Contents 
 Post-bid means the verification of the running or display of an ad, after such running or display has occurred. Publisher means a source of ad inventory, such as website owners, website operators or app developers. Publishers are generally either managed or owned and operated. An owned and operated publisher receives 100 of the profit for impressions sold. This is opposed to a managed publisher: a publisher that does not own its inventory but has a financial relationship with those who do. Supply Side Platform or SSP means a platform that enables Publishers to access advertiser demand from a variety of networks, exchanges, and platforms via one interface. 300-millisecond window means the window of time adopted by the digital advertising industry in which a website or app has to load the content on their website and auction off the advertising space on their web property. Volume means the concept buying large scale amounts of media in hopes of reaching a specific, smaller audience that lives within that larger pool.

 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview Kubient, Inc. Kubient, we, our, or the Company ), a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in May 2017 to solve some of the most significant problems facing the global digital advertising industry. The Company s experienced team of marketing and technology veterans has developed the Audience Marketplace, a modular, highly scalable, transparent, cloud-based software platform for real-time trading of digital, Programmatic Advertising. The Company s platform s open marketplace gives both advertisers (ad space buyers) and Publishers (ad space sellers) the ability to use machine learning in the most critical parts of any Programmatic Advertising inventory auction, while simultaneously and significantly reducing those advertisers and Publishers exposure to fraud, specifically in the Pre-bid environment. The Company also provides unique capabilities with its proprietary pre-bid ad fraud detection prevention, Kubient Artificial Intelligence KAI ), which has the ability to stop fraud in the critical 300 millisecond window before an advertiser spends their budget on fraudulent ad space. The technology is powered by deep learning algorithms, the latest advancement in machine learning, which allows the Company to ingest vast amounts of data, find complex patterns in the data and make accurate predictions. Most importantly, it s self-learning, getting smarter and more accurate over time. This provides advertisers a powerful tool capable of preventing the purchase of ad fraud. The Company believes that its Audience Marketplace technology allows advertisers to reach entire audiences rather than buying single impressions from disparate sources. By becoming a one stop shop for advertisers and publishers, providing them with the technology to deliver meaningful messages to their target audience, all in one place, on a single platform that is computationally efficient, transparent, and as safely fraud-free as possible, the Company believes that its Audience Marketplace platform (and the application of the platform s machine learning algorithms) leads to increased publisher revenue, lower advertiser cost, reduced latency and increased economic transparency during the advertising auction process. Recent Updates Nasdaq Deficiency Notice On January 12, 2023, the Company received a deficiency notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff (the Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of the Company s common stock for the prior 30 consecutive business days, the Company was not in compliance with the requirement to maintain a minimum bid price of 1.00 per share for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). Pursuant to Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company was provided with a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until July 11, 2023, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of the Company s common stock must have met or exceeded 1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days prior to July 11, 2023.

 KAI On December 6, 2022, the United States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO approved our application and issued US Patent No 11,521,231 for our proprietary ad fraud identification and prevention technology, KAI. The patent provides intellectual property protection for KAI from now until 2040. Just two months after this issuance, in the first quarter of 2023, we announced the release of KAI 2.0. The revamped solution now comes with improvements for the entire suite of KAI functionalities, including: Expanded real-time AI with 25 algorithms running in under 10 milliseconds and built-in efficiencies to significantly expand the number and complexity of algorithms in the future; Full support for the much larger scale IPv6 protocol (to add to the existing IPv4 support); Extensive supply path optimization (SPO) support with ads.txt and Sellers.JSON/SupplyChain Object verification; Enhanced support for new CTV and audio formats; and Data mining capabilities for identifying what is driving fraud at the most granular level with more than 50 specific potential causes in order to be able to take action to mitigate it. 
 These enhanced capabilities of our proprietary solution feature benefits for our publisher and advertiser clients. Looking ahead, we expect to continue upgrading KAI to add value-added features for our clients. COVID-19 and Other Macroeconomic Factors The worldwide spread of COVID-19, including the emergence of variants and subvariants, as well as rising interest rates, inflation, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and geopolitical developments (including the war in Ukraine) have resulted, and may continue to result, in a global slowdown of economic activity, which may decrease demand for a broad variety of goods and services, including those provided by our clients, while also disrupting supply channels, sales channels and advertising and marketing activities for an unknown period of time until economic activity normalizes. As a result of the current uncertainty in economic activity, we are unable to predict the size and duration of the impact on our revenue and our results of operations. The extent of the impact of these macroeconomic factors on our operational and financial performance will depend on a variety of factors, including the duration and spread of COVID-19 and its variants and the duration and the extent of geopolitical disruption and their respective impacts on our clients, partners, industry, and employees, all of which are uncertain at this time and cannot be accurately predicted. For example, many of our employees adopted a hybrid work schedule consisting of both in-person work and working from home. Additionally, we began to decrease the use of our physical office spaces in order to conserve our capital for other post-COVID business development initiatives. We continue to monitor the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and take steps deemed appropriate to limit the impact on our business. Silicon Valley Bank On March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank SVB was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC was appointed as receiver. Thus, on March 17, 2023, we moved the majority of our funds on deposit at SVB to other banks, with the intention to move the remainder of our funds on deposit at SVB once we have transitioned all accounting and payroll functions connected to our account at SVB to accounts at other banks, such as our depository account at JP Morgan Chase. While we do not anticipate any losses, liquidity issues, or capital resource constraints arising as a result of the winding down of our accounts at SVB, we cannot predict at this time to what extent our or our collaborators, employees, suppliers, and/or vendors could be negatively impacted by the closure of SVB and other macroeconomic and geopolitical events. Similarly, the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has made and may continue to make it difficult for us to forecast revenue and operating results and to make decisions regarding operational cost structures and investments. We have committed, and we plan to continue to commit, resources to grow our business, employee base, and technology development, and such investments may not yield anticipated returns, particularly if worldwide business activity continues to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depend on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, and if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business may be harmed.

 There can be no assurance that precautionary measures, whether adopted by us or imposed by others, will be effective, and such measures could negatively affect our sales, marketing, and client service efforts, delay and lengthen our sales cycles, decrease our employees , clients , or partners productivity, or create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm our business and results of operations. What We Do: Audience-Based Marketing on Our Full Stack Platform Our Audience Marketplace s platform enables advertisers and publishers to transact directly between each other on an open, end to end real-time bidding platform for programmatic digital advertising. The advertising inventory on our platform is available in any channel: desktop, mobile, digital out-of-home, and connected devices; and in any format: video, display, audio, and native. Indeed, we believe our single, fully integrated audience platform provides a comprehensive, fraud-minimized, transparent, independent advertising marketplace that facilitates intelligent decision-making, and automated transaction execution for the programmatic advertising industry. We optimize the liquidity and effectiveness of the advertising supply chain, increasing revenue for publishers and improving return on investment for advertisers. Our platform offers a machine learning-powered fraud prevention solution, extremely low latency times and an audience management platform which provides omni-channel access into all advertising channels, inventory and ad formats. Thanks to our management and development teams deep experience with artificial intelligence applications, our platform is constantly self-optimizing, using our software s ability to analyze and learn from vast volumes of data. We are confident that the additional data we obtain from the volume of transactions on our platform helps to make our machine-learning algorithms more intelligent over time. Advertising is sometimes defined as the transfer of a message from one party to another for the purpose of education, motivation or suggestion. Advertisers who pay to send a message, should be confident that it arrives to the individual it was intended for and delivers its expected outcome. Our solution consistently ensures this is the case, by verifying each and every message and intended audience. As a result, we believe that we process, analyze and connect billions of audience participants and devices faster and more efficiently than the industry standard.

 Digital Advertising Fraud Solution: Machine Learning Combined with Artificial Intelligence Thanks to advances in technology, the advertising inventory that is bought and sold in these real time auctions during the bid stream is customized to each individual viewer. This viewer customization is often called programmatic advertising, a new form of advertising where advertisers are able to specifically target their preferred audiences and demographics (rather than placing ads in generic public forums such as billboards or during live events, in hopes that the coveted audience or demographic sees the ad). According to eMarketer, digital advertising is one of the fastest growing sectors in the advertising industry, which is expected to reach 835.82 billion by 2026; rising from 567.49 billion in 2022. Digital programmatic advertising s reach includes channels such as online, mobile browsing, in-app, text messages, out of home video advertising (in locations such as gas stations and airports) and digital or internet television services. The explosive growth of programmatic digital advertising has created unique challenges for advertisers and publishers that want to connect and engage their audiences. One of the primary challenges facing the digital advertising industry is that, like the meteoric growth of digital advertising itself, fraud is also growing rapidly. Despite attempts by advertisers and publishers to prevent fraud and conduct quality assurance checks, Juniper Research estimates that the losses experienced by advertisers will be increased to 113 billion by 2026. Additionally, programmatic advertising was seen by the majority of industry professionals as the overwhelming medium at highest risk of compromise to fraud. In a market of spent advertising dollars projected to increase almost 38 from 2022-2026, the total addressable market for properly servicing ad fraud is ripe for the picking. Digital advertising fraud occurs when an ad is displayed to a fake website or Bot in an effort to falsely inflate web traffic numbers, rather than being displayed to a legitimate web site to be viewed by a human being. An advertiser that pays for an ad that is displayed to a Bot has wasted the budget spent for the placement of that ad, as it is human beings that might spend money on the product or service being advertised, as opposed to a Bot. Thus, brands and advertisers that cannot prevent their ads being shown to Bots become victims to the billions of dollars lost to ad fraud annually, as calculated by Juniper Research and Forrester Consulting. We believe that digital advertising fraud is further exacerbated by the fact that our industry is increasingly fragmented. The most popular solutions that have emerged in the marketplace for selling digital advertising are not connected to the solutions used by industry participants for purchases of digital advertising. In other words, advertisers use DSPs to purchase digital advertising, whereas publishers use completely different platforms called SSPs to sell advertising space to those advertisers. Therefore, advertisers may not know who is selling them advertising inventory, and publishers may not know who is purchasing such inventory. With the two sides of any auction not connected, and likely not communicating with each other across different platforms, it is difficult to assign responsibility to tracking down fraud after an ad sale has already occurred. We have created a marketplace where advertisers and publishers can interact directly. This layer of direct transparency allows advertisers to more efficiently identify ad fraud, and to ensure that they are only buying advertising space that delivers the expected value of a particular campaign. Furthermore, fraud prevention is also fragmented as a result of advertisers and publishers using different platforms to conduct digital advertising auctions. Indeed, many DSPs and SSPs do not even have built-in fraud prevention solutions, instead relying on third parties to identify ad fraud after an ad is displayed. Our internally-developed fraud prevention solution is native to our platform and detects fraud before the digital advertising auction is concluded. As a result of the fragmented, complex and inefficient infrastructure currently in use for programmatic advertising, fraud is rampant in the digital advertising marketplace. Bad actors use of fake websites and Bots to sell advertising space costs advertisers billions of dollars a year. A large part of the reason that widespread fraud runs rampant in the digital advertising industry is that current machine learning and fraud prevention solutions in our industry can only identify such fraud after an ad purchase has already occurred. We believe it is much harder to stop fraud when trying to catch perpetrators after the fraud has already occurred because the fraudsters have the ability to completely change the fingerprint of the Bot, which allows it to reenter the ecosystem and commit fraud again.

 We believe it is more effective to stop fraud before it occurs than trying to catch perpetrators after the fraud has already occurred. Thus, we have developed what we believe to be the first machine learning technology that can detect fraud within the 300-millisecond window known as the bid stream prior to ad purchases. Our platform s fraud detection solution, KAI is our patent-pending proprietary technology that uses artificial intelligence to analyze live advertising bid stream data to detect potential ad fraud, a major issue within the digital advertising ecosystem. KAI s proprietary technology allows all advertisers to make better-informed, real-time decisions within this brief window of time by identifying potentially fraudulent activity in real-time. KAI is trained using different statistical and machine learning algorithms and is capable of detecting various types of fraud, including user fraud, device fraud, content fraud and heuristic fraud. KAI analyzes 100 of real-time programmatic data and industry-specific information to determine patterns and data points consistent with fraudulent activity, helping advertisers maximize return on ad spend and protecting publishers. KAI is fully integrated into Kubient s Audience Marketplace, or alternatively, can be deployed as a standalone application or enterprise solution on third-party real-time bidding platforms. Latency Solution: Machine Learning We believe that our platform allows us to process digital advertising auctions faster than the competition. Faster auctions ensure that ad campaigns create more impressions that are seen by consumers, as consumers are less likely to become frustrated by slowly loading websites or apps (which normally results in consumers leaving such websites or apps before the ad is displayed). To substantially reduce and minimize latency issues across our fully integrated open marketplace, we use a highly specialized programming language originally designed to be used in extremely fast (but highly dependable) digital telephone communications switches, as well as quant-based speed trading of securities on Wall Street. In addition, our platform s proprietary machine-learning algorithms, sophisticated data processing, high volume storage, detailed analytics capabilities, and a distributed infrastructure that supercharges our bidding process and helps our customers place, and win, more bids for advertising space. We believe we are transforming the digital advertising industry by analyzing billions of data points in record real time speed to enable our solution to make complex decisions in milliseconds, and to execute over 1 million queries per second, billions of transactions per week and trillions of bid requests per month. Additional Platform Functionalities Not only do we believe our platform works faster, more efficiently and more safely in terms of fraud than our competition, we also believe that it provides added functionality over our competitors, such as real time reporting of ad sales, and an open audience marketplace which enables publishers, including websites, mobile applications, video and other digital media properties, to connect their advertising inventory more efficiently and effectively to buyers across the entire advertising ecosystem, including brands, DSPs, ad networks and advertising agencies. In addition, our platform s functionality allows us to quickly adapt to emerging media channels that might have been previously overlooked by the digital marketing ecosystem. For example, outdoor advertising, often referred to as out of home media, such as billboards, bus-stop shelters, public elevators, airport monitors and gas station pump placards, has not traditionally been connected to digital advertising sources. However, these traditional forms of out of home media are increasingly being converted to digital signage. Unlike their traditional out of home counterparts, these updated digital signs, often referred to as digital out of home DOOH media, can display programmatic advertising, such that all of the advantages of our Audience Marketplace can be applied to this rapidly proliferating media channel. By allowing brands, DSPs, ad networks, advertising agencies and brands to bid on DOOH publishers inventory in real-time, just as if DOOH screens were video screens on a desktop computer or mobile device, our Audience Marketplace will allow advertisers to scale campaigns across new and thriving media channels, thereby maximizing inventory fill rates and increasing the audiences that advertisers may target by digital means. Kubient Managed Services (KMS) The Company has embraced platforms, tools and a culture that s designed to help clients achieve their required outcomes. We remain focused on differentiating by helping advertisers achieve tangible, quantifiable outcomes such as heightened brand awareness and increased sales. As such, the Company believes that its KMS offering will be able to benefit advertisers by providing: (i) better audience and performance insight, campaign control, transparency, and execution (ii) expert staff with varied, relevant backgrounds to assist advertisers, and (iii) access to quality tools and platforms for advertisement placement with an emphasis on return on media investment.

This application is currently pending before the US Patent Office. The second patent application relates to our KAI real time, digital advertising fraud prevention solution. This application was approved by the US Patent Office and issued on December 6, 2022, as US Patent No 11,521,231. Since the issuance of our first fraud prevention patent, we have filed a continuation application, which covers advances in our fraud prevention technology since the filing of our first application. This continuation application is currently pending before the US Patent Office. Customers and Revenue We provide our customers with a platform to connect advertisers and publishers. Generally, our revenue generation process begins with publishers. When a publisher aims to fill the available advertising space on its website or app, we typically enter into a twelve-month master service agreement allowing the publisher to sell advertising inventory through our platform. Once the publisher executes our master service agreement and is accepted onto our platform, the publisher is allowed to electronically communicate with our platform through its ad server, in order to provide us information about the publisher s advertising inventory, user base, minimum sale prices and other data signals, as applicable. We also enter into master service agreements to allow third-party exchanges that aggregate publishers available advertising inventory to sell such inventory on our platform. We earn a mark-up, which is the spread between what we collect from advertisers and what we remit to publishers. We only pay for inventory when an advertiser is connected to a publisher and an impression is successfully delivered. We sometimes refer to the amount we pay publishers for inventory upon the delivery of an impression as cost pay. As described further below, cost pay is generally lower than what advertisers ultimately spend to have their ad impression delivered on a publisher s website or app. We also typically enter into twelve-month master service agreements with advertisers that wish to purchase advertising inventory, either on our platform or through their DSP. Our proprietary algorithms use the industry information available (from advertisers, publishers, third parties and our own internal database) to automatically target and bid on publishers inventory to meet an advertiser s campaign objective. We generate revenue from advertisers by charging them fees on a sliding scale based on a percentage of their spend on advertising purchased through our platform, the total of which we sometimes refer to as gross spend. Thanks to the speed of our platform, the matching of publisher and advertiser occurs in fractions of a second, within the short time frame of the bidstream. We recognize revenue upon the completion of each matching transaction, at the moment when an impression has been delivered to the consumer viewing a website or application. We generally bill and collect the full purchase price of impressions from advertisers, unless the advertiser pays through its DSP, in which case the DSP is the entity that pays our fees. In either case, our gross revenue from each impression is equal to gross spend minus cost pay. We consider our customers to be those that generate revenue during the period and is a mix of direct publishers, third-party exchanges that aggregate both publishers available advertising inventory and advertising budgets, along with direct advertisers and advertising agencies. Further, the Company s definition of customer encompasses advertisers that purchased even a single impression on the Company s platform during the period, not just advertisers that signed a twelve-month master service agreement. We believe that growth of the programmatic advertising market is important for our ability to continually grow our business. Adoption of programmatic advertising by advertisers allows us to acquire new customers and grow revenue from existing customers. We also believe that current industry trends will lead more advertisers to seek out a better fraud prevention solution to protect their advertising budgets, such as the one offered on our platform.

 Similarly, we believe that the adoption of programmatic advertising by unique advertising inventory owners, such as digital out of home content providers for which we have developed a unique solution, will allow us to expand the volume and type of advertising inventory that we present to advertisers using our platform. KAI On December 6, 2022, the United States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO approved our application and issued US Patent No 11,521,231 for our proprietary ad fraud identification and prevention technology, KAI. The patent provides intellectual property protection for KAI from now until 2040. Just two months after this issuance, in the first quarter of 2023, we announced the release of KAI 2.0. The revamped solution now comes with improvements for the entire suite of KAI functionalities, including: Expanded real-time AI with 25 algorithms running in under 10 milliseconds and built-in efficiencies to significantly expand the number and complexity of algorithms in the future; Full support for the much larger scale IPv6 protocol (to add to the existing IPv4 support); Extensive supply path optimization (SPO) support with ads.txt and Sellers.JSON/SupplyChain Object verification; Enhanced support for new CTV and audio formats; and Data mining capabilities for identifying what is driving fraud at the most granular level with more than 50 specific potential causes in order to be able to take action to mitigate it. These enhanced capabilities of our proprietary solution feature benefits for our publisher and advertiser clients. Looking ahead, we expect to continue upgrading KAI to add value-added features for our clients. Growth Strategy The key elements of our long-term growth strategy are as follows: Enhancing our existing auction technology to improve adoption among publishers and advertisers, which we expect will increase our revenue. Further developing our fraud prevention system, which is powered by our proprietary KAI machine learning technology. Opportunistically acquire companies that expand our core technologies and introduce the Company to potential new client bases that are potentially accretive to the Company s future earnings. 
 Growing our customer base by increasing our salesforce to engage brands, agencies, website owners, app owners and other connected device owners, to facilitate marketplace participation.

 Increasing our global footprint across the globe, especially in Latin America, Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. 
 Industry Overview Most consumers are unaware that when they browse a webpage, watch a video on the internet, use a mobile app or watch an internet-connected TV, there is often a behind-the-scenes auction for the purchase and sale of digital advertising space as the consumer s desired content loads. In such auctions, advertisers (i.e., ad space buyers, such as sporting goods or consumer products manufacturers) purchase advertising space from publishers (i.e., ad space sellers, such as mobile app developers or website operators). Advertisers bid on each impression and if the bid is won, the ad is displayed on the publisher s website or app being viewed by the consumer. As the technology behind these auctions began to develop, traditional methods of digital advertising were used, where manual negotiations conducted by human brokers played a vital role in deciding the prices of digital advertising inventory to be bought and sold. Similarly, human brokers sought to place ad inventory in the digital equivalents of traditional public forums such as billboard-like banner ads or during digitally-broadcast sporting events, in hopes that the largest audience possible might see an ad. However, in recent years, the technology behind these auctions has changed dramatically. Now, real time bidding has become an automated process that enables the buying and selling of individual impressions for each digital ad in milliseconds. In the blink of an eye, real time digital auctions determine what ad will display, where the ad will be displayed and what price the advertiser has to pay to the publisher for displaying the ad. The real time auction process is currently in the process of completely replacing the role of a human broker, by automating the buying and selling of ad space in a 300 millisecond window called the bid stream. Another significant challenge facing participants in the digital marketing industry is the problem of latency, or loading wait times. Existing participants in the digital advertising marketplace have invested billions of dollars in large and cumbersome system infrastructures that are costly and slow by today s standards. Their outdated infrastructure has caused hundreds of companies to provide a patchwork of solutions to address the slow and costly nature of the current digital advertising infrastructure that we believe are ineffective when compared with our solution. As a result of this patchwork of solutions, we believe the digital advertising marketplace has become complex and inefficient, with relatively long delays before an ad is displayed becoming commonplace. These delays often result in a user leaving a website or smartphone app before the advertiser s content loads. If the user does not view the ad which the advertiser paid to place on the publisher s website or app, then the advertiser has wasted the budget spent for the placement of that ad. The problem of ineffective digital advertising has created large-scale lost revenue in our industry. Given that ROI is generally the main driver of digital advertising decision making, the inability to calculate it correctly, or at all, will continue to perpetuate the ineffective digital advertising environment. To combat the large-scale loss in advertising dollars spent, the landscape of marketing from the perspective of metric-based analysis has evolved. In their 2022 The State of Marketing report, Salesforce states that marketers are embracing more sophisticated metrics to cater to various KPI standards. The following metrics are the most tracked by marketing organizations: revenue, customer satisfaction analytics, web/mobile analytics, customer acquisition costs, marketing/sales funnel performance, content engagement, customer retention rates, customer referral rates/volume, and customer lifetime value. While all of these marketing KPIs saw an increase across the board, web/mobile analytics, customer acquisition costs, and customer satisfaction analytics saw the biggest year-over-year jumps in adoption. Additionally, a related study called State of the Connected Customer published by Salesforce explained that from here on out, customer engagement is digital-first with customers estimated to have spent 56 of online interactions with companies in 2020 and an increase to 60 of online interactions with companies in 2021. The report also shows that the younger generations of Millennials and Gen Zers to be more inclined to engage companies through digital channels. The increasing need for effective advertising spend has seemingly illuminated the increasing need by both publishers and advertisers to cut fraudulent advertising engagement significantly.

 Competition We derive our revenue from the digital advertising market, which is rapidly evolving, highly competitive, complex and fragmented. We currently compete for advertising spend with large, well-established companies as well as smaller, privately-held companies. Some of our larger competitors with more resources may be better positioned to execute on advertising campaigns conducted over multiple channels such as social media, mobile and video, yet we provide unique channels not found in the digital advertising market typically, such as the true programmatic DOOH auctions we perform. We believe that this, coupled with our other capabilities, will allow us to keep step with the larger competitors in the short term and surpass them in the long term. While the majority of the market is dominated by two companies, Facebook and Google, we do not consider them to be our competitors. Our growth is focused in the rest of the available market and there are many companies who compete with us for that share. The Trade Desk is one of our fastest growing competitors for brand and advertiser budgets with a solid foundation and strong cash flow and client base. Their product known as a Demand Side Platform competes with our own Demand Side Platform however, we believe our platform has key advantages, such as built-in proprietary fraud prevention, direct publisher connections, a Supply Side Platform and a centralized auction hub. These advantages, in our opinion, provide us with more leverage when approaching advertisers and requesting budget. There are other platforms and exchanges that can be considered a competitor to one or more of our products as well. A majority of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have more capital to invest in their businesses however they operate on technology we consider to be outdated and inferior to our newer more agile technology. Competitors could also seek to gain market share by reducing the prices they charge to advertisers, introducing products and solutions that are similar to ours or introducing new technology tools for advertisers and digital media properties, yet the failure of these competitors to offer transparency on pricing as we do is likely to reduce or negate such impact. Moreover, increased competition for video advertising inventory from digital media properties could result in an increase in the portion of advertiser revenue that we must pay to digital media property owners to acquire that advertising inventory which is beneficial to us as our technology offers a more efficient auction thus allowing us to reduce cost for advertisers and increase revenue for publishers. Some large advertising agencies that represent advertising customers have their own relationships with digital media properties and can directly connect advertisers with digital media properties. Our business will suffer to the extent that our advertisers and digital media properties purchase and sell advertising inventory directly from one another or through other companies that act as intermediaries between advertisers and digital media properties. Other companies that offer analytics, mediation, ad exchange or other third-party solutions have or may become intermediaries between advertisers and digital media properties and thereby compete with us. Any of these developments would make it more difficult for us to sell our solutions and could result in increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses or the loss of market share. Other companies that offer analytics, mediation, ad exchange or other third-party solutions have or may become intermediaries between advertisers and digital media properties and thereby compete with us. Despite this, we believe that they do not offer a full software suite like us, as such, the long-term effect of any interruption caused by such companies will be limited. Our fraud prevention solution competes with the small landscape of other fraud prevention companies such as Human, Double Verify and Integral Ad Science. However, we believe that our product is the only product in this space that has patent pending technology allowing it to perform instream prevention as opposed to the landscapes standard.

 Sales and Marketing Given our self-serve business model, we focus on supporting, advising and training our customers to use our platform independently as soon as they are ready to transact. There is an element of education about our platform that requires us to invest in sales and marketing programs and personnel to grow our business. We focus our efforts to build this awareness through trade shows and sponsored events. The addition of the KMS offering has augmented our sales and marketing capabilities by adding assigned account managers, real time dashboard monitoring, performance analysis, as well as quarterly client reviews, ensuring that our advertising clients using the Audience Marketplace have all logistics running smoothly and that any assistance they need would be there in an instant. As of March 28, 2023, our sales and marketing team consisted of 5 employees. The team employs a consultative approach to both new and existing customers. Once a new customer has access to our platform, they work closely with our customer service teams as they onboard the new customer and provide continuous support throughout the early campaigns. Typically, once a customer has gained some initial experience, it will move to a fully self-serve model and request support as needed. Seasonality Our cash flows from operations vary from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of advertiser spending. For example, many advertisers devote a disproportionate amount of their advertising budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year to coincide with increased holiday purchasing. Indeed, in digital advertising, seasonal downswings typically occur at the start in January (the beginning of the calendar year) and October (the beginning of the fiscal year for many companies). Upswings occur in December (the end of the calendar year) and September (the end of the fiscal year for many companies). This is due to the timing of when budgets are negotiated and distributed. Other swings occur around holidays, and other large consumer focused events such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Platform Development Part of our dedication to innovation means that we are constantly improving our platform, with new features and products being routinely released. We empower our development teams by encouraging them to release updated features and increase functionality fast and often. As a company, we are always exploring new and better ways to continuously improve the performance of our technology. Our development teams are intentionally lean and nimble in nature, providing for transparency and accountability. Privacy and Data Protection Regulation Privacy and data protection legislation and regulation play a significant role in our business. We and our customers use data about Internet users collected through our platform to manage and execute digital advertising campaigns in a variety of ways, including delivering advertisements to Internet users based on their particular geographic locations, the type of device they are using, or their interests as inferred from their web browsing or app usage activities. We do not use this data to identify specific individuals, and we do not seek to associate this data with information that can be used to identify specific individuals. We take steps not to collect or store personally identifiable information, or personal data. The definitions of personally identifiable information and personal data, however, vary by jurisdiction and are evolving. As a result, our platform and business practices must be assessed regularly in each jurisdiction where we do business to avoid violating applicable legislation and regulation. In the United States, a complex patchwork quilt of both state and federal legislation governs activities such as the collection and use of data by companies like us. Digital advertising in the United States has, up until very recently, primarily been subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, which has primarily relied upon Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits companies from engaging in unfair or deceptive trade practices, including alleged violations of representations concerning privacy protections and acts that allegedly violate individuals privacy interests. The FTC has commenced the examination of privacy issues that arise when marketers track consumers across multiple devices, otherwise known as cross-device tracking.

 The United States legal landscape concerning data and privacy continues to evolve at a rapid, and sometimes unpredictable pace. Domestic laws in this area are also complex and developing rapidly. Many state legislatures have adopted legislation that regulates how online business handle data. California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA ), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. On January 1, 2023, the CCPA was amended by the California Consumer Privacy Act CPRA ). The CPRA expands upon and enhances the provisions of the CCPA. Further, the CPRA establishes its own enforcement body. The CCPA/CPRA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Similar privacy legislation in the vein of the CCPA has been proposed in a number of states. Indeed, Virginia, Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut have also enacted similar statutes; the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act VCDPA ), the Colorado Privacy Act CPA ), the Utah Consumer Privacy Act UCPA ), and Connecticut s CTDPA. In addition, a dozen other states have data privacy bills either introduced or in committee, with the expectation that they will be enacted in coming years, further complicating the compliance landscape. In the wake of the enactment of the foregoing statutes, operationally, the impact of compliance has immediate effect. To be sure, all the statues require certain access and consent rights be extended to internet users. Therefore, compliance would necessarily involve an additional layer of infrastructure to accommodate such right. Because our platform reaches users throughout the world, including Europe, Australia and Asia, some of our activities may also be subject to foreign legislation. Internationally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply, including but not limited to the European Union. The European Union has adopted what is known as one of the most robust and comprehensive data protection regulations in the world - the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR ). The GDPR and contains numerous requirements and obligations on data processors and comprehensive documentation requirements for data protection, processing, and compliance programs. In addition, the GDPR promulgates data subject rights for EU citizens, which provides increased control for EU citizens. Specifically, EU citizens posses rights of access, corrections, deletion, and portability. These rights translate into increased operational costs to companies who have to take steps to operationalize these rights in order to comply and meet any request. Non-compliance risks substantial fines. Under the GDPR, fines of up to 20 million euros or up to 4 of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater, could be imposed for violations of certain of the GDPR s requirements. In additional the GDPR, the European Union is currently in the process of replacing the current ePrivacy directive with the ePrivacy Regulation, which contains enhanced protections and regulations concerning the use of electronic communications services, including in connection with online tracking technologies. Accordingly, once the ePrivacy Regulation is enacted, the compliance landscape will only become more challenging. Certainly, an increase in operational costs and risk will arise to the extent we continue to do business in the European market. In particular, risks associated with non-compliance proceedings from governmental agencies, as well as limitations on our ability to attract and retain European customers. Brazil and China have also established data protection statutory frameworks as well. The interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws along with contractually imposed industry standards are simply not predictable in light of the nascent nature of the data privacy legal landscape. These laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data handling practices or how our products and platform capabilities operate. The possibility of fines, lawsuits, and other claims and penalties may necessitate a change in our business activities and practices or modify our products and platform capabilities, which could have an adverse effect on our business. In prior years, some government regulators and privacy advocates advocated vigorously for a Do Not Track standard that would allow Internet users to express a preference, independent of cookie settings in their browsers, not to have their online browsing activities tracked. In 2010, the FTC issued a staff report emphasizing the need for simplified notice, choice and transparency to the consumer regarding the collection, use and sharing of data, and suggested implementing a Do Not Track browser setting that would allow consumers to choose whether or not to allow tracking of their online browsing activities. All major Internet browsers have implemented some version of a Do Not Track setting. However, there is no commonly accepted definition of tracking, no consensus regarding what message is conveyed by a Do Not Track setting and no industry standards regarding how to respond to a Do Not Track preference.

We believe our employee relations to be good. Corporate Information Our mailing address is 500 7th Avenue, 8th Floor, New York, New York 10018. Our telephone number is (800) 409-9456. Available Information Our website, www.Kubient.com, provides access, without charge, to our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). The information provided on our website is not part of this Annual Report and is therefore not incorporated by reference unless such information is otherwise specifically referenced elsewhere in this Annual Report. The SEC also maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding our company that we file electronically with the SEC. Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company and a Smaller Reporting Company We are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). For as long as we are an emerging growth company, unlike public companies that are not emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act, we will not be required to: provide an auditor s attestation report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes Oxley Act provide more than two years of audited financial statements and related management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations; comply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the PCAOB requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer; provide certain disclosure regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies or hold stockholder advisory votes on the executive compensation required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act or obtain stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of the: last day of the fiscal year in which we have 1.235 billion or more in total annual gross revenues; date on which we become a large accelerated filer (the fiscal year-end on which the total market value of our common equity securities held by non-affiliates is 700 million or more as of June 30); date on which we issue more than 1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period; or last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering.

 We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations in this report and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. Finally, we are a smaller reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds 250 million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter of that year, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded 100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter of that year. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES On July 14, 2021, as amended on February 1, 2022 and September 19, 2022, we entered into a lease agreement for the use of our current office space located at 500 7th Avenue, 8th Floor, New York, New York 10018. For the six month period ended August 31, 2022, the lease was for approximately 917 square feet for 15,630 per month and for the six month period ended March 31, 2023, the lease was for approximately 50 square feet for 2,442 per month. We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space would be available if needed.

 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, we may be subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that are routine and incidental to our business. Although some of the legal proceedings set forth herein may result in adverse decisions or settlements, Management believes that the final disposition of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In August 2022, we received subpoenas from both the SEC and the United States Attorney s Office for the Southern District of New York requesting certain information from us relating to revenue in connection with two of our customers. Kubient is fully cooperating with both of these agencies. In addition, the following material legal proceedings were recently settled: On March 11, 2022, the Company, Aureus Holdings, LLC d/b/a Lo70s Lo70s and JPAR, LLC entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (the Lo70s Settlement Agreement ). Pursuant to the Lo70s Settlement Agreement, the parties agreed to dismiss the litigation (Aureus Holdings, LLC d/b/a Lo70s v. Kubient, Inc., et al., Superior Court of Delaware, Case No. N20C-07-061) and resolve all claims among them, including potential or future claims arising from the letter of intent that the Company and Lo70s had entered into in March 2019, as well as a consulting agreement entered into between the Company and an employee of Lo70s in connection with such letter of intent. On March 14, 2022, the court in the matter entered an order approving the Lo70s Settlement Agreement, and the case was dismissed with prejudice. In the Lo70s Settlement Agreement, the Company expressly denies any and all liability and the dismissal of the case with prejudice was entered by the court without a final judgment of liability entered against the Company. Under the terms of the Lo70s Settlement Agreement, the Company made a cash payment of 975,000 to Lo70s in full satisfaction of the matter, as well as the releases and covenants of Lo70s and JPAR, LLC set forth in the agreement, such that the Lo70s Settlement Agreement fully concludes this matter.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that are based upon current expectations and involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties. Overview Kubient, a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in May 2017 to solve some of the most significant problems facing the global digital advertising industry. The Company s experienced team of marketing and technology veterans has developed the Audience Marketplace, a modular, highly scalable, transparent, cloud-based software platform for real-time trading of digital, Programmatic Advertising. The Company s platform s open marketplace gives both advertisers (ad space buyers) and Publishers (ad space sellers) the ability to use machine learning in the most critical parts of any Programmatic Advertising inventory auction, while simultaneously and significantly reducing those advertisers and Publishers exposure to fraud, specifically in the Pre-bid environment.

Table of Contents 
 The Company also provides unique capabilities with its proprietary pre-bid ad fraud detection prevention, Kubient Artificial Intelligence KAI ), which has the ability to stop fraud in the critical 300 millisecond window before an advertiser spends their budget on fraudulent ad space. The technology is powered by deep learning algorithms, the latest advancement in machine learning, which allows the Company to ingest vast amounts of data, find complex patterns in the data and make accurate predictions. Most importantly, it s self-learning, getting smarter and more accurate over time. This provides advertisers a powerful tool capable of preventing the purchase of ad fraud. The Company believes that its Audience Marketplace technology allows advertisers to reach entire audiences rather than buying single impressions from disparate sources. By becoming a one stop shop for advertisers and publishers, providing them with the technology to deliver meaningful messages to their target audience, all in one place, on a single platform that is computationally efficient, transparent, and as safely fraud-free as possible, the Company believes that its Audience Marketplace platform (and the application of the platform s machine learning algorithms) leads to increased publisher revenue, lower advertiser cost, reduced latency and increased economic transparency during the advertising auction process.

 Net Revenues For the year ended December 31, 2022, net revenues decreased by 334,359, or 12 , to 2,403,408 from 2,737,767 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net revenues was primarily associated with a decrease of net revenues associated with a major customer as compared to the 2021 period, partially offset by revenues generated in the 2022 period related to customer contracts acquired in connection with our acquisition of MediaCrossing in November 2021. Sales and Marketing For the year ended December 31, 2022, sales and marketing expenses increased by 747,376, or 25 , to 3,779,509 from 3,032,133 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily attributable to increases in headcount and associated costs of approximately 1,100,000 including executives hired during 2021, software subscriptions of approximately 114,000, public relations of approximately 24,000 in conjunction with decrease of consulting fees of approximately 120,000 and selling expenses of approximately 371,000 associated with a major customer as compared to the 2021 period. Technology For the year ended December 31, 2022, technology expenses increased by 97,745, or 3 , to 3,177,497 from 3,079,752 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily attributable to increases in headcount costs of 398,000, stock-based compensation expense of approximately 176,000, cloud hosting expenses of approximately 150,000, partially offset by decreases in technology programming fees of approximately 467,000 related to the termination of our Russian contractors, amortization expense of approximately 117,000, consulting fees of approximately 30,000, software subscriptions of approximately 10,000 and travel and entertainment expenses of approximately 2,000. General and Administrative For the year ended December 31, 2022, general and administrative expenses increased by 440,451, or 7 , to 6,558,052 from 6,117,601 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily attributable to increases in legal and professional fees of approximately 601,000 primarily related to increased legal costs, stock-based compensation expense of approximately 243,000, rent expense of approximately 97,000, board fees of approximately 108,000, dues and memberships fees of approximately 43,000, state franchise tax expense of approximately 43,000, travel and entertainment expenses of approximately 19,000, software subscriptions of approximately 12,000, partially offset by decreases in recruiting fees of approximately 224,000, consulting fees of approximately 252,000 primarily related to the hiring of an outside compensation consultant, insurance expense of approximately 40,000, office related expenses of approximately 25,000, bad debt expense of approximately 16,000 and headcount costs of approximately 169,000. Impairment Loss on Intangible Assets, Property and Equipment and Goodwill During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized an impairment loss on intangible assets of 2,626,974, an impairment loss on property and equipment of 49,948 and an impairment loss on goodwill of 463,000. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we identified triggering events that indicated its finite-lived intangible assets and goodwill were at risk of impairment and, as such, performed the required quantitative impairment assessment to ultimately evaluate whether carrying value exceeded fair value. The primary triggers for the impairment review were a loss of customers as well as a reduction in the value of Kubient s market capitalization. As a result of the quantitative assessments, we determined the intangible assets and goodwill were fully impaired. Loss on Legal Settlement The Company recognized a loss on legal settlement of 880,381 for the year ended December 31, 2021 related to a settlement agreement reached in March 2022 wherein we made a cash payment of 975,000 to Lo70s in consideration of the dismissal of the ligation among the parties, as well as the releases and covenants of the parties.

 Other Income For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had other income of 631,688 as compared to other income of 80,387 during the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in other income is primarily due to the change in fair value contingent consideration approximately 613,000, primarily due to the decline in the Company s stock price as well as changes in the likelihood that forecasted milestones would be met for the remainder of 2022. Non-GAAP Measures Adjusted EBITDA The Company defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain non-recurring items and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of our ongoing operating performance from period to period. These items will include stock-based compensation, restructuring and severance costs, transaction costs, acquisition costs, certain other non-recurring charges and gains that the Company does not believe reflects the underlying business performance. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA consisted of the following: 

For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Net Loss (13,619,884) (10,291,713) Interest expense 10,909 8,383 Interest income (18,597) (88,537) Change in fair value of contingent consideration (613,000) Depreciation and amortization 330,993 452,136 EBITDA (13,909,579) (9,919,731) Adjustments: Stock-based compensation expense 991,487 724,042 Adjusted EBITDA (12,918,092) (9,195,689) Adjusted Loss Per Share (0.90) (0.67) Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding - Basic and Diluted 14,319,060 13,695,700 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). Management believes that because Adjusted EBITDA excludes (a) certain non-cash expenses (such as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation) and (b) expenses that are not reflective of the Company s core operating results over time (such as stock-based compensation expense), this measure provides investors with additional useful information to measure the Company s financial performance, particularly with respect to changes in performance from period to period. The Company s management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (a) as a measure of operating performance, (b) for planning and forecasting in future periods, and (c) in communications with the Company s board of directors concerning the Company s financial performance. The Company s presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation and should not be used by investors as a substitute or alternative to net income or any measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Instead, management believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should be used to supplement the Company s financial measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP to provide a more complete understanding of the trends affecting the business.

 Although Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for, or more meaningful than, amounts determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Some of the limitations to using non-GAAP measures as an analytical tool are (a) they do not reflect the Company s interest income and expense, or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Company s debt, (b) they do not reflect future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, and (c) although depreciation and amortization charges are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and non-GAAP measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. Liquidity and Capital Resources We measure our liquidity in a number of ways, including the following: 

For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Cash and cash equivalents 14,739,484 24,907,963 Working capital 12,873,338 22,676,301 Availability of Additional Funds We believe our current cash on hand is sufficient to meet its operating and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months from the date these financial statements are issued. Our operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business, including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including our ability to successfully commercialize our products and services, competing technological and market developments, and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings. Cash Flows Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2021 Our sources and uses of cash were as follows: Cash Flows From Operating Activities We experienced negative cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 in the amounts of 9,599,932 and 7,674,792, respectively. The net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily a result of cash used to fund a net loss of 13,619,884, adjusted for net non-cash expenses of 3,856,402, partially offset by 163,550 of net cash provided by changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities. The net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily a result of cash used to fund a net loss of 10,291,713, adjusted for net non-cash expenses of 1,198,876, partially offset by 1,418,045 of net cash provided by changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities. Cash Flows From Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 16,549, which was attributable to purchases of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 1,672,486, which was attributable to purchases of intangible assets, property and equipment as well as the MediaCrossing purchase consideration.

 Cash Flows From Financing Activities We experienced negative and positive cash flows from financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 in the amounts of (551,998) and 9,473,113, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, 402,155 of cash was used to repay financed director and officer insurance premiums and 149,843 was used to repay our PPP loan. During the year ended December 31, 2021, 9,787,149 of proceeds were from exercises of options and warrants, partially offset by 145,050 of cash used to repay financed director and officer insurance premiums and 177,347 was used to partially repay our PPP loan. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We did not have, during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any relationships with any organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Contractual Obligations As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by paragraph (a)(5) of this Item. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, contingent assets and liabilities, each as of the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods presented. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates their estimates and assumptions, and the effects of any such revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary. Management bases their estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that they believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual outcomes could differ materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus, we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements and understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Revenue Recognition The Company maintains a contract with each customer and supplier, which specify the terms of the relationship. The Company provides a service to its customers (the buy-side ad networks who work for advertisers) by connecting advertisers and publishers. For this service, the Company earns a percentage of the amount that is paid by the advertiser, who wants to run a digital advertising campaign, which, in some cases, is reduced by the amount paid to the publisher, who wants to sell its ad space to the advertiser. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which it expects to be entitled, including the impact of any implicit price concessions over the course of the contract. The Company s performance obligation is to facilitate the publication of advertisements. The performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time that the ad is placed. Subsequent to a bid being won, the associated fees are generally not subject to refund or adjustment. Historically, any refunds and adjustments have not been material. The revenue recognized is the amount the Company is responsible to collect from the customer related to the placement of an ad (the Gross Billing ), less the amount the Company remits to the supplier for the ad space (the Supplier Cost ), if any. The determination of whether the Company is the principal or agent, and hence whether to report revenue on a gross basis equal to the Gross Billing or on a net basis for the difference between the Gross Billing and Supplier Cost, requires judgment. The Company acts as an agent in arranging via its platform for the specified good (the ad space) to be purchased by the advertiser, as it does not control the goods or services being transferred to the end customer, it does not take responsibility for the quality or acceptability of the ad space, it does not bear inventory risk, nor does it have discretion in establishing price of the ad space. As a result, the Company recognizes revenue on a net basis for the difference between the Gross Billing and the Supplier Cost.

Table of Contents 
 The Company invoices customers on a monthly basis for the amount of Gross Billings in the relevant period. Invoice payment terms, negotiated on a customer-by- customer basis, are typically between 45 to 90 days. However, for certain agency customers with sequential liability terms as specified by the Interactive Advertising Bureau, (i) payments are not due to the Company until such agency customers has received payment from its customers (ii) the Company is not required to make a payment to its supplier until payment is received from the Company s customer and (iii) the supplier is responsible to pursue collection directly with the advertiser. As a result, once the Company has met the requirements of each of the five steps under ASC 606, the Company s accounts receivable are recorded at the amount of Gross Billings which represent amounts it is responsible to collect and accounts payable, if applicable, are recorded at the amount payable to suppliers. In the event step 1 under ASC 606 is not met, the Company does not record either the accounts receivable or accounts payable. Accordingly, both accounts receivable and accounts payable appear large in relation to revenue reported on a net basis. Business Combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, the assets acquired (including identified intangible assets), the liabilities assumed and any contingent consideration are recorded at their acquisition date fair values. The Company s fair value measurement of the contingent consideration is based on significant inputs not observed in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. Level 3 instruments are valued based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and reflect the Company s own assumptions in measuring fair value. Intangible Assets Intangible assets are comprised of costs to acquire and develop computer software, including the costs to acquire third-party data which is used to improve the Company s artificial intelligence platform for client use, as well as costs to acquire customer lists, customer contracts and related customer relationship and restrictive covenant agreements. The intangible assets have estimated useful lives of two years for the computer software, five years for the capitalized data, seven years for the customer lists and three years for the restrictive covenant agreements. Once placed into service, the Company amortizes the cost of the intangible assets over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. Impairment of Long-lived Assets The Company reviews for the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable. An impairment would be recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. Stock-Based Compensation The Company measures the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award. The fair value of the award is measured on the grant date. The fair value amount is then recognized over the period during which services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. Upon the exercise of an award, the Company issues new shares of common stock out of its authorized shares. The Company accrues for any equity awards at fair value that have been contractually earned but not yet issued. ITEM 7A.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Marcum LLP We have served as the Company s auditor since 2019. March 30, 2023

On March 10, 2023, SVB was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, and the FDIC was appointed as receiver. Thus, on March 17, 2023, the Company moved the majority of its funds on deposit at SVB to other banks, with the intention to move the remainder of its funds on deposit at SVB once the Company has transitioned all accounting and payroll functions connected to its account at SVB to accounts at other banks, such as our depository account at JP Morgan Chase. While the Company does not anticipate any losses, liquidity issues, or capital resource constraints arising as a result of the winding down of its accounts at SVB, it cannot predict at this time to what extent it or its collaborators, employees, suppliers, and/or vendors could be negatively impacted by the closure of SVB and other macroeconomic and geopolitical events.

Accounts receivable are recorded at the amount the Company is responsible to collect from the customer. See Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition for additional details.

In accordance with ASC 805, the Company determined that the Transaction should be accounted for as a business combination after determining that the acquired set of assets of MediaCrossing, the fair value of which was not concentrated in a single asset or group of similar assets and included (a) cash, (b) prepaid expenses and other current assets, (c) intangible assets as detailed further below and (d) an assembled workforce, met the definition of a business. As a result, Kubient has recorded the business combination in its consolidated financial statements and has applied the acquisition method to account for MediaCrossing s assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon completion of the Transaction.

 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Management recognizes that a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION None. ITEM 9C.

 Board Composition and Leadership Structure Paul Roberts serves as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Strategy Officer, President and Chairman. Although the roles of Chief Executive Officer, Chief Strategy Officer, President and Chairman of our board of directors are currently performed by the same person, we do not have a policy regarding the separation of these roles, as our board of directors believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders to make that determination from time to time based upon the position and direction of the Company and the membership of our board of directors. Our board of directors has determined that our leadership structure is appropriate for the Company and our stockholders as it helps to ensure that the board of directors and management act with a common purpose and provides a single, clear chain of command to execute our strategic initiatives and business plans. In addition, our board of directors believes that a combined role of Chief Strategy Officer, President and Chairman is better positioned to act as a bridge between management and our board of directors, facilitating the regular flow of information. Our board of directors also believes that it is advantageous to have a Chairman with an extensive history with and knowledge of our technology and industry (as is the case with our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Strategy Officer and President, Paul Roberts). Director Independence Nasdaq rules require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company s audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees be independent, and that audit committee members also satisfy independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. The Nasdaq independence definition includes a series of objective tests, such as that the director is not, and has not been for at least three (3) years, one of our employees, that neither the director nor any of his family members has engaged in various types of business dealings with us and that the director is not associated with the holders of more than five percent (5 of our common stock. In addition, under applicable Nasdaq rules, a director will only qualify as an independent director if, in the opinion of the listed company s board of directors, that person does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our board of directors has undertaken a review of the independence of each director. Based on information provided by each director concerning their background, employment and affiliations, our board of directors has determined that four of our six directors, do not have relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors is independent as that term is defined under the listing standards of Nasdaq. In making such determination, our board of directors considered the relationships that each such non-employee director has with us and all other facts and circumstances that our board of directors deemed relevant in determining his independence, including the beneficial ownership of our capital stock by each non-employee director. Board s Role in Risk Oversight and Management Our board of directors, as a whole and through its committees, is responsible for the oversight of risk management, while our management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risks faced by us. The board of directors receives regular reports from members of senior management on areas of material risk to the Company, including operational, financial, legal, regulatory, strategic and reputational risks. In its risk oversight role, our board of directors has the responsibility to satisfy itself that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed. Committees of Our Board of Directors Our board of directors has established an audit committee, a business development and marketing committee, a compensation committee, and a nominating and corporate governance committee. The composition and responsibilities of each committee of our board of directors are described below. Members serve on these committees until their resignation or until otherwise determined by our board of directors. Our board of directors may establish other committees as it deems necessary or appropriate from time to time.

Director nominations by a stockholder or group of stockholders for consideration by our stockholders at our annual meeting of stockholders, or at a special meeting of our stockholders that includes on its agenda the election of one or more directors, may only be made pursuant to our bylaws or as otherwise provided by law. Nominations pursuant to our bylaws are made by delivering to our Corporate Secretary, within the time frame described in our bylaws, all of the materials and information that our bylaws require for director nominations by stockholders. No person shall be eligible to serve as a director of the Company unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in our bylaws and any nominee proposed by a stockholder not nominated in accordance with our bylaws shall not be considered or acted upon for execution at such meeting. Stockholders notice for any proposals requested to be included in our proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act (including director nominations), must be made in accordance with that rule. There were no material changes to the procedures by which stockholders may recommend nominees to the Company s board of directors during the year ended December 31, 2022. Role of Board in Risk Oversight Process Our board of directors has responsibility for the oversight of the Company s risk management processes and, either as a whole or through its committees, regularly discusses with management our major risk exposures, their potential impact on our business and the steps we take to manage them. The risk oversight process includes receiving regular reports from board committees and members of senior management to enable our board to understand the company s risk identification, risk management and risk mitigation strategies with respect to areas of potential material risk, including operations, finance, legal, regulatory, strategic and reputational risk. The audit committee reviews information regarding liquidity and operations, and oversees our management of financial risks. Periodically, the audit committee reviews our policies with respect to risk assessment, risk management, loss prevention and regulatory compliance. Oversight by the audit committee includes direct communication with our external auditors, and discussions with management regarding significant risk exposures and the actions management has taken to limit, monitor or control such exposures. The compensation committee is responsible for assessing whether any of our compensation policies or programs has the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking. The nominating and corporate governance committee manages risks associated with the independence of the board, corporate disclosure practices, and potential conflicts of interest. While each committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of such risks, the entire board is regularly informed through committee reports about such risks. Matters of significant strategic risk are considered by our board of directors as a whole.

 Narrative to Summary Compensation Table Executive Compensation Considerations The Company s compensation committee reviews financial information and other performance metrics relative to the historical compensation of executive management and comparative information prepared internally. The compensation committee also reviews management s recommendations for compensation levels of all of the Company s named executive officers and considered these recommendations with reference to relative compensation levels of like-size institutions. The totality of the information reviewed by the compensation committee is considered when establishing current executive salary levels, and similar analysis is expected to be considered when reviewing and establishing future salaries and long-term incentives. The Company s compensation policies and practices are designed to ensure that they do not foster risk taking above the level of risk associated with the Company s business model. For this purpose, the compensation committee generally considers the Company s financial performance, comparing that performance to the performance metrics included in the Company s strategic plan. The compensation committee also generally evaluates management s compensation in light of other specific risk parameters. The Company s compensation programs are aimed at enabling it to attract and retain the best possible executive talent and rewarding those executives commensurate with their ability and performance. The Company s compensation programs consist primarily of base salary and bonus. Independent Advice on Pay-Setting Process The compensation committee retained an outside compensation consultant, Mercer LLC Mercer ), to benchmark pay levels for the executive leadership team and outside directors, including base salary and short- and long-term incentives. Mercer also assisted with the design of the short- and long-term incentive programs to ensure such programs support the Company s business strategy and are consistent with market practice. To benchmark pay, Mercer considered data from three sources to reflect the Company s intersecting talent markets: Option Impact Database : This database is made up of private technology companies based in the United States that have completed at least a Post Series B funding round. Mercer Comptryx Database : This database is made up of both private and public technology companies based in the United States with revenues less than 500 million. Public Company Peer Group : Mercer reviewed the public filings and financial statements of 17 publicly traded companies with revenues approximately 0.5x-2.5x that of the Company, and with which the Company competes for talent and that are in industries similar to the Company, including advertising, application/systems software, interactive media and services, and internet and direct marketing retail. Mercer also referenced peer practices in assisting with the design of the short- and long-term incentive plans, including metrics and weightings, and payout leverage and performance periods, and equity vehicle prevalence for the long-term plan. Mercer considered the public company peer group practices as well as the practices of larger companies in recommending incentive plan design decisions.

 We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC. These rules generally provide that a person is the beneficial owner of securities if such person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of securities, or to dispose or direct the disposition of securities. A security holder is also deemed to be, as of any date, the beneficial owner of all securities that such security holder has the right to acquire within 60 days after such date through (i) the exercise of any option or warrant, (ii) the conversion of a security, (iii) the power to revoke a trust, discretionary account or similar arrangement or (iv) the automatic termination of a trust, discretionary account or similar arrangement. Except as disclosed in the footnotes to this table and subject to applicable community property laws, we believe that each person identified in the table has sole voting and investment power over all of the shares shown opposite such person s name. The percentage of beneficial ownership is based on 14,515,940 shares of our common stock outstanding as of March 28, 2023. Unless otherwise noted, the business address of each of the following entities or individuals is 500 7th Avenue, 8th Floor, New York, NY 10018.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE Policies and Procedures for Related Person Transactions Our board of directors has adopted written policies and procedures for the review of any transaction, arrangement or relationship in which we are a participant, the amount involved exceeds 120,000 and one of our executive officers, directors, director nominees or 5 stockholders, or their immediate family members, each of whom we refer to as a related person, has a direct or indirect material interest. If a related person proposes to enter into such a transaction, arrangement or relationship, which we refer to as a related person transaction, the related person must report the proposed related person transaction to our Chief Financial Officer. The policy calls for the proposed related person transaction to be reviewed and, if deemed appropriate, approved by our audit committee. Whenever practicable, the reporting, review and approval will occur prior to entry into the transaction. If advance review and approval is not practicable, the committee will review, and, in its discretion, may ratify the related person transaction. The policy also permits the chairman of the committee to review and, if deemed appropriate, approve proposed related person transactions that arise between committee meetings, subject to ratification by the committee at its next meeting. Any related person transactions that are ongoing in nature will be reviewed annually. A related person transaction reviewed under the policy will be considered approved or ratified if it is authorized by the committee after full disclosure of the related person s interest in the transaction. As appropriate for the circumstances, the committee will review and consider: the related person s interest in the related person transaction; the approximate dollar value of the amount involved in the related person transaction; the approximate dollar value of the amount of the related person s interest in the transaction without regard to the amount of any profit or loss; whether the transaction was undertaken in the ordinary course of our business; 
 46 

Table of Contents 
 whether the terms of the transaction are no less favorable to us than terms that could have been reached with an unrelated third party; and the purpose of, and the potential benefits to us of, the transaction. 
 The audit committee may approve or ratify the transaction only if the committee determines that, under all of the circumstances, the transaction is in our best interests. The committee may impose any conditions on the related person transaction that it deems appropriate. In addition to the transactions that are excluded by the instructions to the SEC s related person transaction disclosure rule, our board of directors has determined that the following transactions do not create a material direct or indirect interest on behalf of related persons and, therefore, are not related person transactions for purposes of this policy: interests arising solely from the related person s position as an executive officer of another entity (whether or not the person is also a director of such entity) that is a participant in the transaction, where (i) the related person and all other related persons own in the aggregate less than a 10 equity interest in such entity, (ii) the related person and his or her immediate family members are not involved in the negotiation of the terms of the transaction and do not receive any special benefits as a result of the transaction, and (iii) the amount involved in the transaction is less than the greater of 200,000 or 5 of the annual gross revenues of the company receiving payment under the transaction; and a transaction that is specifically contemplated by provisions of our certificate of incorporation, as amended and restated, or bylaws. 
 The policy provides that transactions involving compensation of executive officers shall be reviewed and approved by the compensation committee in the manner specified in its charter. We have a written policy regarding the review and approval of related person transactions. With respect to such transactions, it is our policy for our board of directors to consider the nature of and business reason for such transactions, how the terms of such transactions compared to those which might be obtained from unaffiliated third parties and whether such transactions were otherwise fair to and in the best interests of, or not contrary to, our best interests. In addition, all related person transactions required prior approval, or later ratification, by our board of directors. Related Party Transactions There were no related party transactions during the year ended December 31, 2022. Director Independence Jonathan Bond, Grainne Coen, Elisabeth DeMarse, Lawrence Harris, and Jeannie Mun are independent as that concept is defined in Section 10A of the Exchange Act, all current audit committee members are independent as that concept is defined in the applicable rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC.
