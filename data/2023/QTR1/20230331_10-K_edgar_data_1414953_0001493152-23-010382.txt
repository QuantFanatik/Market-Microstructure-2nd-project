ITEM
1. BUSINESS 

COMPANY
OVERVIEW 

EQUATOR
Beverage Company, a Delaware corporation is headquartered in Jersey City, NJ. EQUATOR s business is new product development,
beverage production, distribution, and sales marketing of its beverages. Our beverages are Non-GMO Project Verified, and USDA
Organic. We produce both nonalcoholic and ready to drink alcoholic beverages. EQUATOR also has a line of sparkling energy beverages
that are focused on the female consumer. EQUATOR beverages are available in North America, the Caribbean and Bermuda. We package our
beverages in 100 recyclable, eco-friendly packaging. The packaging has a low impact on the environment. Also, our products are
plant-based, Eco-friendly and renewable. 

CURRENT
OPERATIONS 

Sales
and Distribution 

The
Company s flagship product is MOJO Coconut Water. In addition to Coconut Water, the Company produces Coconut Water + Pineapple Juice, Sparkling Coconut Water + Citrus, Sparkling
Coconut Water + Blood Orange, Sparkling Coconut Water + Pink Grapefruit, Sparkling Coconut Water Energy + Citrus, Sparkling Coconut Water

Cubano Blue Agave Tequila Organic Sparkling Coconut Water + Blood Orange and Organic Coconut Water. We seek to grow the market share of our products by
expanding our hybrid distribution network through the relationships and efforts of our management and third-party partners and broker
network, and new products and packaging. The Company packages its beverages in 100 recyclable, Eco-Friendly packaging that can be recycled
infinite times and is not made from carbon oil-based packaging. The packaging has a very low impact on the environment, and does not
contribute to landfills and the pollution of our bodies of water. Also, our products are plant-based, Eco-friendly and renewable. 

Production 

The
Company has multiple sources for its production. The Company s fruit sources are of high quality. The fruit is part of the overall
taste and quality of our products. Currently, the Company has multiple production facilities that it could source products from, each
of the facilities could supply our forecasted demand. 

Competition 

The
beverage industry is competitive. Competitors in our market compete for brand recognition, ingredient sourcing, product shelf space,
and e-commerce page rankings. Our competitors have similar distribution channels and retailers to deliver and sell their products. 

Government
Regulation 

Within
the United States, beverages are governed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA ). As such, it is necessary
for the Company to establish, maintain and make available for inspection records as well as to develop labels (including nutrition information)
that meet FDA requirements. The Company s production facilities are subject to FDA regulation. 

Employees 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had two employees. The Company also uses the services of contractors, consultants and other third-parties.
We contract with food brokers to represent our products to specific specialized sales channels. We utilize the services of direct sales
and distribution companies that deliver and sell our products to their customers. We contract with manufacturing facilities to produce
our products and outsource the storage and transportation of our products. 

CORPORATE
HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT 

The
Company began producing MOJO branded products in 2016. EQUATOR Beverage Company is headquartered in Jersey
City, New Jersey and our internet site is www.EquatorBeverage.com. EQUATOR s stock is traded on the OTCQB under the symbol MOJO.
On June 8, 2022, the Board of Directors and majority stockholder of the Company approved a change of name from MOJO Organics, Inc. to
EQUATOR Beverage Company. This change of name was filed with the State of Delaware and became effective July 5, 2022.

ITEM
2. RISK FACTORS 

In
addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should consider the following factors, which could materially affect
our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. The risks described below are not the only risks facing
our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect
our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. 

If
we are unable to expand our operations in the marketplace, our growth rate could be negatively affected. 

Our
success depends in part on our ability to grow our business. We have adopted and implemented a strategic plan to increase awareness of
our products, secure additional distribution channels, and foster and strengthen our supply, manufacturing and distribution relationships.
Our strategic plan includes addressing changes in the market. There can be no assurance that we will achieve the growth necessary to
achieve our objectives. 

We
could need additional capital in the future to expand our operations and execute our business objectives. 

Should
we need additional capital to expand our operations, financing transactions may include the issuance of equity, debt securities, and
credit facilities. 

The
challenges of competing with other beverage companies could result in reductions to our revenue and operating margins. 

The
nonalcoholic beverage segment of the beverage industry is competitive. We compete with numerous beverage companies, including those marketing
similar products. All beverages companies are competing for stomach share on a daily basis which is approximately 64 oz. of fluid
per day, per person. Our success depends on our ability to secure distribution channels for our products, our ability to make consumers
aware of our products and the appeal of our products to consumers. 

Disruption
of supply, increases in costs or shortages of ingredients could affect our operating results. 

Availability
of supply and the prices charged by the producers of production inputs used in our products can be affected by a variety of factors,
including the general demand by other buyers for the same fruits used by us in our products, and country politics and country economics
in the area in which our fruit is grown. 

The
quality of fruit we seek trades on a negotiated basis, depending on supply and demand at the time of the purchase. An increase in the
price of any fruit that we use in our products will have a negative effect on our margins should we be unable to increase our sales price.
Higher energy costs may increase the cost of transporting our supplies. Changes in emission rules for maritime vessels will likely increase
costs of shipping our products. Conversely, lower fruit prices and lower energy prices will have a positive result on transport and packaging
costs. 

3 

We
use independent bottlers for the filling of our products and, as such, are subject to the bottler s production and quality control. 

We
use independent bottlers for the production of our products. Accordingly, we are dependent on the bottlers and their ability to meet
production demands and to achieve product quality. We play an active role in the production of our beverages, which includes but is not
limited to developing our formulations, maintaining control over the labeling and packaging of our beverages, and packaging and function
of our packaging and correct FDA labeling. We also review and monitor the safety certifications of the factories including their status
with the United States Food and Drug Administration. We also inspect the warehouses that our products are stored in, and monitor the
trucking companies that deliver our goods. 

Litigation
and publicity concerning food quality, health claims, and other issues could expose us to significant liabilities. 

The
packaged food industry can be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from customers and government authorities resulting from
product quality, health claims, allergens, illness, and injury. Adverse publicity about these allegations may negatively affect the Company,
regardless of whether the allegations are true. In addition, the food industry has been subject to a number of claims based on the nutritional
content of food products they sell, and disclosure and advertising practices. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory
proceedings, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome will have an adverse impact on our
business. In addition, any litigation or regulatory proceedings may result in substantial costs.

arising in the course of our business.

8. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Our
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A is provided in addition
to the accompanying financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations, financial condition
and cash flows. MD A is organized as follows: 

Significant
 Accounting Policies Accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated
 in our reported financial results and forecasts. 

Results
 of Operations Analysis of our financial results comparing the year ended December 31, 2022 to 2021. 

Liquidity
 and Capital Resources Analysis of changes in our cash flows, and discussion of our financial condition and potential sources
 of liquidity. 

This
report includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance.
Forward looking statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions,
or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which
apply only as of the date of this annual report. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that
could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions. 

Significant
Accounting Policies 

We
have prepared our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which requires
management to make significant judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. We base
these significant judgments and estimates on historical experience and other applicable assumptions we believe to be reasonable based
upon information presently available. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as our
operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included in the financial statements as soon
as they became known. Actual results could materially differ from our estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions. 

All
of our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our financial statements,
included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We have identified the following as our significant accounting policies and estimates, which
are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, are the most pervasive and important to the presentation
of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions,
judgments or conditions. 

We
believe the following significant accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation
of our financial statements: 

Use
of Estimates The financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States GAAP ). Management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. 

6 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments Our short-term financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable
and other liabilities, consist primarily of instruments without extended maturities. We believe that the fair values of our current assets
and current liabilities approximate their reported carrying amounts. 

Results
of Operations 

Years
Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 

Revenue 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company reported revenue of 1,821,492 a decrease of 97,390 from revenue of 1,918,882 for the
year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in revenue was due to fewer cases sold in 2022 compared to the same period last year. The
Company s revenue was affected by production and shipping challenges during the year 2022. The factory closures due to COVID-19
and port congestions in the United States during 2022 resulted to backordered inventory and lost sales for the Company. 

Cost
of Revenue 

Cost
of revenue includes finished goods purchase costs, production costs, raw material costs and freight in costs. Also included in cost of
revenue are adjustments made to inventory carrying amounts, including markdowns to market. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, cost of revenue was 1,190,536 or 65 of revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2021, cost of
revenue was 1,069,844 or 56 of revenue. The 9 percentage points increase in cost of revenue was due to higher costs of product,
ocean freight and warehousing costs compared to the same period last year. 

7 

Operating
Expenses 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, the selling, general and administrative expenses was 859,155 an increase of 14,501 from the year
ended December 31, 2021 of 844,654. 

This
increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher compensation expenses in 2022. Office expenses and marketing fees also
increased compared to the same period last year. These increases were partially offset by lower selling expenses for the year ended
December 31, 2022 compared to the same period last year. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Liquidity 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had working capital of 145,867. Net cash used in operating activities was 93,004 for the year ended
December 31, 2022, compared to net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 of 103,463. Net cash provided
by financing activities was 57,261 for year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 107,215 net cash used in financing activities for the
year ended December 31, 2021. Net cash was provided by financing activities of a related party loan and proceeds from the exercise of
stock options, offset by cash used in financing activities to repurchase EQUATOR Restricted Common Stock for the year ended December
31, 2022. 

Working
Capital Needs 

Our
working capital requirements increase as demand grows for our products. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had net
borrowings of 225,000. This was the direct result of supply chain delays in manufacturing and ocean transport times. In 2021, borrowings
were zero. Should the Company require additional working capital during the next twelve months, it may seek to raise additional funds.
Financing transactions may include the issuance of equity, debt securities and obtaining credit facilities.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. It should be noted that the design of any
system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that
any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of the Company s senior management, consisting of the Company s principal executive
and financial officer and the Company s principal accounting officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act as of the end of the period covered by this report (the Evaluation Date ). Based on this evaluation, the Company s
principal executive and financial officer concluded, as of the Evaluation Date, that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
were effective. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The
management of EQUATOR Beverage Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. 

Therefore,
even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. In evaluating
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this evaluation, our officers
concluded that, during the period covered by this annual report, our internal controls over financial reporting were not operating effectively. 

As
previously reported, the Company does not have an audit committee and is not currently obligated to have one. Management does not believe
that the lack of an audit committee is a material weakness. 

Attestation
Report 

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting as such report is not required for non-accelerated filers. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

no security holders have made any such recommendations. Our two directors perform all functions that would otherwise be performed by

ITEM
17. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 

Other
than as disclosed below and in this Form 10-K, there have been no transactions, since January 1, 2022, or any currently proposed transaction,
in which we were or are to be a participant and the amount involved exceeds the lesser of 120,000 or 1 of the average of our total
assets at year end for the last two completed fiscal years and in which any of our directors, executive officers or beneficial holders
of more than 5 of our outstanding Common Stock, or any of their respective immediate family members, has had or will have any direct
or material indirect interest. 

Director
Independence 

We
are not currently subject to listing requirements of any national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system which has requirements
that a majority of the board of directors be independent and, as a result, we are not at this time required to (and we
do not) have our Board of Directors comprised of a majority of Independent Directors. 

Our
Board of Directors has considered the independence of its directors in reference to the definition of independent director 
established by the Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5605(a)(2). In doing so, the Board of Directors has reviewed all commercial and other relationships
of each director in making its determination as to the independence of its directors. After such review, the Board of Directors has determined
that Mr. Devlin qualifies as independent under the requirements of the Nasdaq listing standards.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Shareholders and 

 Board
of Directors of EQUATOR Beverage Company 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of EQUATOR Beverage Company (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period
ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion,
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and
2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
of Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Stock
Issued for Services 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized 181,889 in expenses related to stock issued for services. As discussed in Notes
3 and 4, the Company has issued stock to Management under an employment agreement and periodically issued other shares for services.
Shares issued for services are recorded at their fair value on their measurement dates based upon prices on OTC markets. 

Our
audit procedures to evaluate the appropriateness and accuracy of the accounting and fair value determined by management included reviewing
the agreements and selected documentation supporting the issuances as well as recomputing the valuations made by Management by examining
the prices from third party sources.
