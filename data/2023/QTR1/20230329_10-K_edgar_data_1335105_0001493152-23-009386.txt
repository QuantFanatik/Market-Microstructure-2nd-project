Company
Overview 

The
Company is a drug discovery company that uses biomarker technology to identify enzyme targets associated with serious common diseases
and then designs novel compounds to attack those targets. The Company s corporate office is located in Pasadena, California. 

The
Company s product pipeline is primarily focused on inhibitors of protein phosphatases, used alone and in combination with cytotoxic
agents and/or x-ray and immune checkpoint blockers. The Company believes that inhibitors of protein phosphatases have broad therapeutic
potential not only for cancer but also for other debilitating and life-threatening diseases. The Company is directing its efforts on
clinical development of a specific protein phosphatase inhibitor, referred to as LB-100, which has been shown to have clinical anti-cancer
activity at doses that produce little or no toxicity. 

The
Company s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including the need for additional capital. The Company
has not yet commenced any revenue-generating operations, does not have positive cash flows from operations, relies on stock-based compensation
for a substantial portion of employee and consultant compensation, and is dependent on periodic infusions of equity capital to fund its
operating requirements. 

Description
of Business; Research; Clinical Trial Activities 

Our
primary focus is developing new treatments for human cancers for which better therapies are urgently needed. 

Our
drug discovery process is based on discerning clues to potential new targets for disease treatments reported in the increasingly large
body of literature identifying the molecular variants which characterize human cancers and other non-cancer disorders. We design drugs
for which there are existing data suggesting that they may affect the altered pathways of the cancer cell and may be given safely to
humans. We seek to rapidly arrive at patentable structures through analysis of the literature rather than screening of thousands of structures
for activity against a particular biochemical pathway. 

This
approach has led to the development of two classes of drugs for the treatment of cancer, consisting of protein phosphatase inhibitors
(PTase-i), designated by us as the LB-100 series of compounds, and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), designated by us as the LB-200
series of compounds. Our current focus is on the clinical development of the LB-100 series of compounds. 

The
LB-100 series consists of novel structures which have the potential to be first in their class and may be useful in the treatment of
not only several types of cancer but also vascular and metabolic diseases. 

We
have demonstrated that the lead compound of the LB-100 series is active against a broad spectrum of human cancers in cell culture and
against several types of human cancers in animal models. The research on these compounds was initiated in 2006 under a Cooperative Research
and Development Agreement or CRADA with the National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke or NINDS of the National Institutes
of Health or NIH dated March 22, 2006 that was subsequently extended through a series of amendments until it terminated on April 1, 2013. 

The
LB-100 compounds have been studied against a variety of common and rare cancer types and have been shown to potentiate the activity of
standard anti-cancer drugs in animal models of breast and pancreatic cancer, melanoma, pheochromocytomas and sarcomas. More recently,
the LB-100 compounds have been shown to potentiate the relatively new category of drugs called immune blockers. Because the LB-100 compounds
appear to exert their ability to improve the effectiveness of different forms of chemotherapy, radiation therapy and immunotherapy, we
believe the LB-100 series of compounds may be useful against most, if not all, cancer types. 

- 4 - 

The
LB-200 series consists of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). LB-200 has not yet advanced to the clinical stage and would require
additional capital to fund further development. Accordingly, because of our focus on the clinical development of LB-100 and analogs for
cancer therapy as described below in more detail, we have decided not to actively pursue the pre-clinical development of our LB-200 series
of compounds at this time. At this time, we intend to only maintain our composition of matter patents for LB-200 issued in the United
States. 

Collaborations
with leading academic research centers in the United States, Europe and Asia have established the breadth of activity of LB-100 in pre-clinical
models of several major cancers. There is considerable scientific interest in LB-100 because it exerts its activity by a novel mechanism
and is the first of its type to be evaluated so broadly in multiple animal models of cancer and now in human beings. LB-100 is one of
a series of serine/threonine phosphatase (s/t ptase) inhibitors designed by us. The s/t ptases are ubiquitous enzymes that regulate many
cell signaling networks important to cell growth, division and death. The s/t ptases have long been appreciated as potentially important
targets for anti-cancer drugs. However, because of the multi-functionality of these enzymes, it had been widely held that pharmacologic
inhibitors of s/t ptases would be too toxic to allow their development as anti-cancer treatments, but we have shown that this is not
the case. LB-100 was well-tolerated at doses associated with objective regression (significant tumor shrinkage) and/or the arresting
of tumor progression in patients with progressive cancers. 

Pre-clinical
studies showed that LB-100 itself inhibits a spectrum of human cancers and that combined with standard cytotoxic drugs and/or radiation,
LB-100 potentiates their effectiveness against hematologic and solid tumor cancers without enhancing toxicity. Given at very low doses
in animal models of cancer, LB-100 markedly increased the effectiveness of a PD-1 blocker, one of the widely used new immunotherapy drugs.
This finding raises the possibility that LB-100 may further expand the value of the expanding field of cancer immunotherapy. 

We
completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100 to evaluate its safety that showed it is associated with antitumor activity in humans at
doses that are readily tolerable. Responses included objective regression (tumor shrinkage) lasting for 11 months of a pancreatic cancer
and cessation of growth (stabilization of disease) for 4 months or more of 9 other progressive solid tumors out of 20 patients who had
measurable disease. As Phase 1 clinical trials are fundamentally designed to determine safety of a new compound in humans, we were encouraged
by these results. The next step is to demonstrate in Phase 2 clinical trials the efficacy of LB-100 in one or more specific tumor types,
against which the compound has well documented activity in pre-clinical models. 

Clinical
Trial Agreements 

Moffitt
Cancer Center Clinical Trial Research Agreement 

Effective
August 20, 2018, the Company entered into a Clinical Trial Research Agreement with the Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute Hospital
Inc., Tampa, Florida, effective for a term of five years, unless terminated earlier by the Company pursuant to 30 days written notice.
Pursuant to the Clinical Trial Research Agreement, Moffitt agreed to conduct and manage a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial to evaluate the therapeutic
benefit of the Company s lead anti-cancer clinical compound LB-100 to be administered intravenously in patients with low or intermediate-1
risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). 

In
November 2018, the Company received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its Investigational New Drug Application IND to conduct a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of LB-100 in patients with low and intermediate-1
risk MDS who have failed or are intolerant of standard treatment. Patients with MDS, although usually older, are generally well except
for severe anemia requiring frequent blood transfusions. This Phase 1b/2 clinical trial utilizes LB-100 as a single agent in the treatment
of patients with low and intermediate-1 risk MDS, including patients with del(5q) myelodysplastic syndrome (del5qMDS) failing first line
therapy. The bone marrow cells of patients with del5qMDS are deficient in PP2A by virtue of an acquired mutation and are especially vulnerable
to further inhibition of PP2A by LB-100. The clinical trial began at a single site in April 2019 and the first patient was entered into
the clinical trial in July 2019. A total enrollment of 41 patients is planned. An interim analysis will be done after the first 21 patients
are entered. If there are 3 or more responders but fewer than 7, an additional 20 patients will be entered. If at any point there are
7 or more responders, this will be sufficient evidence to support continued development of LB-100 for the treatment of low and intermediate-1
risk MDS. Recruitment has been slow and the Covid-19 pandemic has further reduced recruitment of patients into the protocol. At the current
rate of accrual, the clinical trial is expected to be completed by June 30, 2025. However, with additional funds, the Company would consider
adding two additional MDS centers to the Phase 2 portion of the study to accelerate patient accrual.

Spanish
Sarcoma Group Collaboration Agreement 

Effective
July 31, 2019, the Company entered into a Collaboration Agreement for an Investigator-Initiated Clinical Trial with the Spanish Sarcoma
Group (Grupo Espa ol de Investigaci n en Sarcomas or GEIS ), Madrid, Spain, to carry out a study entitled
 Randomized phase I/II trial of LB-100 plus doxorubicin vs. doxorubicin alone in first line of advanced soft tissue sarcoma .
The purpose of this clinical trial is to obtain information with respect to the efficacy and safety of LB-100 combined with doxorubicin
in soft tissue sarcomas. Doxorubicin is the global standard for initial treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcomas ASTS ).
Doxorubicin alone has been the mainstay of first line treatment of ASTS for over 40 years, with little therapeutic gain from adding cytotoxic
compounds to or substituting other cytotoxic compounds for doxorubicin. In animal models, LB-100 consistently enhances the anti-tumor
activity of doxorubicin without apparent increases in toxicity. 

GEIS
has a network of referral centers in Spain and across Europe that have an impressive track record of efficiently conducting innovative
studies in ASTS. The Company agreed to provide GEIS with a supply of LB-100 to be utilized in the conduct of this clinical trial, as
well as to provide funding for the clinical trial. The goal is to enter approximately 150 patients in this clinical trial over a period
of two years. As advanced sarcoma is a very aggressive disease, the design of the study assumes a median progression free survival (PFS,
no evidence of disease progression or death from any cause) of 4.5 months in the doxorubicin arm and an alternative median PFS of 7.5
months in the doxorubicin plus LB-100 arm to demonstrate a statistically significant decrease in relative risk of progression or death
by adding LB-100. There is a planned interim analysis of the primary endpoint when approximately 50 of the 102 events required for final
analysis is reached. 

The
Company had previously expected that this clinical trial would commence during the quarter ended June 30, 2020. However, during July
2020, the Spanish regulatory authority advised the Company that although it had approved the scientific and ethical basis of the protocol,
it required that the Company manufacture new inventory of LB-100 under current Spanish pharmaceutical manufacturing standards. These
standards were adopted subsequent to the production of the Company s existing LB-100 inventory. 

In
order to manufacture a new inventory supply of LB-100 for the GEIS clinical trial, the Company engaged a number of vendors to carry out
the multiple tasks needed to make and gain approval of a new clinical product for investigational study in Spain. These tasks included
the synthesis under good manufacturing practices (GMP) of the active pharmacologic ingredient (API), with documentation of each of the
steps involved by an independent auditor. The API was then transferred to a vendor that prepares the clinical drug product, also under
GMP conditions documented by an independent auditor. The clinical drug product was then sent to a vendor to test for purity and sterility,
provide appropriate labels, store the drug, and distribute the drug to the clinical centers for use in the clinical trials. A formal
application documenting all steps taken to prepare the clinical drug product for clinical use must be submitted to the appropriate regulatory
authorities for review and approval before being used in a clinical trial. 

On
October 13, 2022, the Company announced that the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Products (Agencia Espa ola de Medicamentos
y Productos Sanitarios or AEMPS had authorized a Phase 1b/randomized Phase 2 study of LB-100, the Company s lead
clinical compound, plus doxorubicin, versus doxorubicin alone, the global standard for initial treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcomas
(ASTS). Consequently, the GEIS clinical trial is currently scheduled to commence during the quarter ending June 30, 2023 and to be completed
by December 31, 2025. Up to 170 patents will be entered into the clinical trial. The Phase 1b section of the protocol is expected to
be completed by June 30, 2024, at which time the Company expects to have data on both response and toxicity from this portion of the
clinical trial. 

- 6 - 

The
interim analysis of this clinical trial will be done before full accrual of patients is completed to determine whether the study has
the possibility of showing superiority of the combination of LB-100 plus doxorubicin compared to doxorubicin alone. A positive study
would have the potential to change the standard therapy for this disease after four decades of failure to improve the marginal benefit
of doxorubicin alone. 

National
Cancer Institute Pharmacologic Clinical Trial 

In
May 2019, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) initiated a glioblastoma (GBM) pharmacologic clinical trial. This study is being conducted
and funded by the NCI under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, with the Company being required to provide the LB-100 clinical
compound. 

Primary
malignant brain tumors (gliomas) are very challenging to treat. Radiation combined with the chemotherapeutic drug temozolomide has been
the mainstay of therapy of the most aggressive gliomas (glioblastoma multiforme or GBM) for decades, with some further benefit gained
by the addition of one or more anti-cancer drugs, but without major advances in overall survival for the majority of patients. In animal
models of GBM, the Company s novel protein phosphatase inhibitor, LB-100, has been found to enhance the effectiveness of radiation,
temozolomide chemotherapy treatments and immunotherapy, raising the possibility that LB-100 may improve outcomes of standard GBM treatment
in the clinic. Although LB-100 has proven safe in patients at doses associated with apparent anti-tumor activity against several human
cancers arising outside the brain, the ability of LB-100 to penetrate tumor tissue arising in the brain is not known. Unfortunately,
many drugs potentially useful for GBM treatment do not enter the brain in amounts necessary for anti-cancer action. 

The
NCI study is designed to determine the extent to which LB-100 enters recurrent malignant gliomas. Patients having surgery to remove one
or more tumors will receive one dose of LB-100 prior to surgery and have blood and tumor tissue analyzed to determine the amount of LB-100
present and to determine whether the cells in the tumors show the biochemical changes expected to be present if LB-100 reaches its molecular
target. As a result of the innovative design of the NCI study, data from a few patients should be sufficient to provide a sound rationale
for conducting a larger clinical trial to determine the effectiveness of adding LB-100 to the standard treatment regimen for GBMs. Five
patients have been entered and analysis of the blood and tissue will now proceed. If there is evidence in at least two of the patients
of penetration of LB 100 into tumor tissue, the study will be deemed as successful. The results of this study are expected during 2023. 

Clinical
Research Support Agreement with City of Hope National Medical Center 

Effective
January 18, 2021, the Company executed a Clinical Research Support Agreement with the City of Hope National Medical Center, an NCI-designated
comprehensive cancer center, and City of Hope Medical Foundation (collectively, City of Hope ), to carry out a Phase 1b
clinical trial of LB-100, the Company s first-in-class protein phosphatase inhibitor, combined with a standard regimen for treatment
of untreated extensive- stage disease small cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC). LB-100 will be given in combination with carboplatin, etoposide
and atezolizumab, an FDA-approved but marginally effective regimen, to previously untreated ED-SCLC patients. The dose of LB-100 will
be escalated with the standard fixed doses of the 3-drug regimen to reach a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). Patient entry will be expanded
so that a total of 12 patients will be evaluable at the RP2D to confirm the safety of the LB-100 combination and to look for potential
therapeutic activity as assessed by objective response rate, duration of overall response, progression-free-survival and overall survival. 

The
clinical trial was initiated on March 9, 2021, with patient accrual expected to take approximately two years to complete. However, as
patient accrual has been slower than expected, the Company is currently seeking to add two additional sites to increase the rate of patient
accrual, with at least one major site expected to be added by June 30, 2023. With the additional sites, the Company expects that this
clinical trial will be completed by December 31, 2024. Without the additional sites, the Company expects that this clinical trial will
be completed no sooner than December 31, 2025. 

Effective
March 6, 2023, Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI), Nashville, Tennessee, joined the City of Hope s ongoing Phase 1b clinical
trial to assess the combination of the Company s first-in-class protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor, LB-100, with a standard
regimen for previously untreated, extensive stage small cell lung cancer disease. SCRI, one of the largest community-based cancer trial
centers in the United States, is expected to expedite and expand the accrual of patients to this clinical trial, thus reducing the time
required to demonstrate the feasibility, tolerability and efficacy of adding LB-100 to the current standard treatment regimen. 

- 7 - 

The
Company currently expects that enrollment in this clinical trial will range from approximately 18 to 30 enrollees, with 24 enrollees
as the most likely number. Should fewer than 42 enrollees be required, the Company has agreed to compensate City of Hope on a per enrollee
basis. If a significant improvement in outcome is seen with the addition of LB-100, this would be an important advance in the treatment
of a very aggressive disease.

Other
Significant Agreements and Contracts 

NDA
Consulting Corp. On December 24, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement with NDA Consulting Corp. for consultation and advice
in the field of oncology research and drug development. As part of the agreement, NDA also agreed to cause its president, Dr. Daniel
D. Von Hoff, M.D., to become a member of the Company s Scientific Advisory Committee. The term of the agreement was for one year
and provided for a quarterly cash fee of 4,000. The agreement has been automatically renewed for additional one-year terms on its anniversary
date since 2014. 

BioPharmaWorks .
Effective September 14, 2015, the Company entered into a Collaboration Agreement with BioPharmaWorks, pursuant to which the Company engaged
BioPharmaWorks to perform certain services for the Company. Those services included, among other things, assisting the Company to commercialize
its products and strengthen its patent portfolio; identifying large pharmaceutical companies with a potential interest in the Company s
product pipeline; assisting in preparing technical presentations concerning the Company s products; consultation in drug discovery
and development; and identifying providers and overseeing tasks relating to clinical development of new compounds. 

BioPharmaWorks
was founded in 2015 by former Pfizer scientists with extensive multi-disciplinary research and development and drug development experience.
The Collaboration Agreement was for an initial term of two years and automatically renews for subsequent annual periods unless terminated
by a party not less than 60 days prior to the expiration of the applicable period. In connection with the Collaboration Agreement, the
Company agreed to pay BioPharmaWorks a monthly fee of 10,000, subject to the right of the Company to pay a negotiated hourly rate in

Foundation
for Angelman Syndrome Therapy . Effective August 12, 2020, the Company entered into a Master Service Agreement with the Foundation
for Angelman Syndrome Therapy (FAST) to collaborate in supporting pre-clinical studies of the potential benefit of LB-100 in a mouse
model of Angelman Syndrome (AS) as reported in The Proceedings of The National Academy of Science (Wang et al, June 3, 2019). The pre-clinical
studies were to be conducted at The University of California - Davis under the direction of Dr. David Segal, an internationally recognized
leader in AS research. If the pre-clinical studies confirm that LB-100 reduces AS signs in rodent models, the Company has agreed to enter
into discussions with FAST with respect to possible collaborations to most efficiently assess the benefit of LB-100 in patients with
AS, which is a rare disease affecting an estimated one out of 12,000 to one out of 20,000 persons in the United States. The genetic cause
of AS, reduced function of a specific maternal gene called Ube3, has been understood for some time, but the molecular abnormality resulting
from the genetic lesion has now been shown to be increased concentrations of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a molecular target of the
Company s investigational compound, LB-100. The Company has agreed to provide FAST with a supply of LB-100 to be utilized in the
conduct of this study, which was initially expected to be completed within three years. Conditioned on FAST s completion of this
study, the Company has agreed to pay FAST five percent (5 of all proceeds, as defined in the Master Service Agreement, received by
the Company, up to a maximum of 250,000, from the exploitation of the study results. 

The
research team at the University of California - Davis recently completed their pre-clinical study of the potential benefit of LB-100
in a mouse model of AS. The preliminary analysis indicates that the positive results previously reported by Chinese investigators were
not confirmed in the US model. The Company is currently awaiting input from FAST as to whether it intends to continue to pursue pre-clinical
studies of LB 100. To date, FAST has not indicated whether it desires to pursue further studies of LB-100, but in light of the failure
to confirm the Chinese study results, the Company does not plan to pursue further studies of AS. 

Netherlands
Cancer Institute. On October 8, 2021, the Company entered into a Development Collaboration Agreement with the Netherlands Cancer
Institute, Amsterdam, one of the world s leading comprehensive cancer centers, and Oncode Institute, Utrecht, a major independent
cancer research center, to identify the most promising drugs to be combined with LB-100, and potentially LB-100 analogues, to be used
to treat a range of cancers, as well as to identify the specific molecular mechanisms underlying the identified combinations. The Company
has agreed to fund the study and provide a sufficient supply of LB-100 to conduct the study. The study is expected to take approximately
two years to conduct. 

MRI
Global. The Company has contracted with MRI Global for stability analysis, storage and distribution of LB-100 for clinical trials
in the United States. On June 10, 2022, the contract was amended to reflect an estimated completion date of April 30, 2023.

Potential
Future Clinical Trials 

Our
objective is to initiate a Phase 1b/2 immunotherapy clinical trial in 2023. Our ability to conduct such a clinical trial, and possibly
other clinical trials, is subject to the availability of additional financial resources. The clinical trial would study the ability of
LB-100 to enhance the effectiveness of adding LB-100 to an immunoblocker in treatment of one of several cancers in which immunotherapy
alone has modest activity. 

The
Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in LB-100 plus a PD-1 inhibitor in yet to be specified solid tumors would require additional financing in excess
of that currently budgeted and/or partnering relationships with other pharmaceutical companies. From time to time, we engage discussions
with various parties with respect to the financing immunotherapy clinical trials. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain
such financing and/or partnering relationships on acceptable terms or at all. Our longer-term objective is to secure one or more strategic
partnerships with pharmaceutical companies with major programs in cancer research and drug development. 

Intellectual
Property 

Our
products will ultimately be based on our intellectual property and are expected to be covered by our patents. These patents now cover
sole rights to the composition and synthesis of our LB-100 series of drugs, which is the Company s lead clinical compound in development.
Joint patent applications with the NIH have been filed for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme, medulloblastoma, and neuroblastoma. 

Patent
applications for the LB-100 series (oxabicycloheptanes and heptenes) have been filed in the United States and internationally under the
Patent Cooperation Treaty. Patents for composition of matter and for several uses of the LB-100 series have been issued in the United
States, Mexico, Australia, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and by the European Patent Office and
the Eurasian Patent Office. 

Although
we do not plan to allocate resources to further develop our LB-200 series of drugs, we have patents that cover sole rights to the composition
and synthesis of the LB-200 series of drugs, with coverage of the LB-200 series now limited to those patents issued in the United States.
For the LB-200 series, only patents issued in the United States are being maintained. 

The
Company strives to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the
development of its business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending its patent rights, which are owned solely by our wholly-owned
Delaware subsidiary, Lixte Biotechnology, Inc., except in two instances jointly with one of our collaborators. The Company also relies
on trade secrets relating to its proprietary pipeline of product candidates and on know-how and continuing technological innovation to
develop and strengthen its pipeline. The Company intends to rely on regulatory protection afforded by regulatory agencies through data
exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent term extensions, where available. 

The
Company s success will depend in large part on its ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially
important technology, inventions and know-how related to its business; defend and enforce its patents; preserve the confidentiality of
its trade secrets; and operate without infringing valid and enforceable patents or proprietary rights of third parties. The Company s
ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing our technology may depend on the extent to
which the Company has rights under valid and enforceable licenses, patents, or trade secrets that cover these activities. In some cases,
enforcement of these rights may depend on cooperation of the joint owners of our jointly owned patents and patent applications. 

With
respect to both the Company s solely and jointly owned intellectual property, the Company cannot be sure that patents will be granted
on any of its pending patent applications or on any patent applications filed solely or jointly by the Company in the future; we cannot
be sure that any of the Company s existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially
useful in protecting the Company s intended commercial products or therapeutic methods; and the Company cannot be sure that an
agency or court would determine that the Company s solely or jointly owned patents are valid and enforceable.

The
Market 

Anti-Cancer
Drugs 

We
have developed two series of pharmacologically active drugs, designated as the LB-100 series and the LB-200 series. We believe that the
mechanism by which compounds of the LB-100 series affect cancer cell growth is different from cancer agents currently approved for clinical
use. Lead compounds from each series have activity against a broad spectrum of common and rarer human cancers in cell culture systems.
In addition, compounds from both series have anti-cancer activity in animal models of glioblastoma multiforme, neuroblastoma, and medulloblastoma,
all cancers of neural tissue. Lead compounds of the LB-100 series also have activity against melanoma, breast cancer and sarcoma in animal
models and enhance the effectiveness of commonly used anti-cancer drugs in animal models. The enhancement of anti-cancer activity of
these anti-cancer drugs occurs at doses of LB-100 that do not significantly increase toxicity in animals. It is therefore hoped that
when combined with standard anti-cancer regimens against many tumor types, our compounds will improve therapeutic benefit without enhancing
toxicity in humans. 

Marketing
Plan 

Our
primary goal to date has been to take our primary compound, LB-100, through Phase 2 clinical trials. Because of the novelty and spectrum
of activity of LB-100, we believe it is reasonably likely we may find a partner in the pharmaceutical industry with interest in this
compound at some stage of its clinical development. However, we would prefer to delay the partnering/licensing decision until the potential
value of our products are augmented by demonstrating there is no impediment to clinical evaluation and a therapeutic dose level is determined
in clinical trials. Demonstration of clinical usefulness would be expected to substantially increase the value of our product. 

Research
and Development 

Further
development of lead compounds in addition to LB-100 will require pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic characterization (i.e., how long a
drug persists in the blood and how long the drug is active at the intended target) and large animal toxicologic evaluation under conditions
meeting FDA requirements. Most anti-cancer drugs fail in development because of unacceptable toxicity. However, by analogy with mechanistically
related compounds, there is good reason to believe that lead compounds in addition to LB-100 will be able to be given to humans safely
by routes and at doses resulting in concentration of drug producing anti-cancer activity in animal models. 

- 14 - 

One
of our most valuable resources is our scientific team, a coalition of various experts brought together through contracts and other collaborative
arrangements. The team has expertise in cancer biology, proteomics (cancer biomarkers), medicinal and synthetic chemistry, pharmacology,
clinical oncology and drug evaluation. In a relatively short period of time and at low cost, this group has developed lead compounds
of two different classes of drugs that are positioned for development as new treatments for several types of cancer. 

Product
Development 

We
are subject to FDA regulations as it conducts clinical trials. Additionally, any product for which we obtain marketing approval, along
with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual
review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. Even if regulatory approval of a product is granted, the approval
may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for costly post-marketing
testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products,
including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturer or manufacturing processes,
or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal
of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recall, fines, suspension of regulatory approvals, product seizures, injunctions
or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

Competition 

The
life sciences industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and profound technological change. Our present and potential competitors
include major pharmaceutical companies, as well as specialized biotechnology and life sciences firms in the United States and in other
countries. Most of these companies have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Additionally, mergers
and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors.
Our existing or prospective competitors may develop processes or products that are more effective than ours or be more effective at implementing
their technologies to develop commercial products faster. Our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection and/or receiving
regulatory approval for commercializing products before we do. Developments by our competitors may render our product candidates obsolete
or non-competitive. 

We
also experience competition from universities and other research institutions, and we are likely to compete with others in acquiring
technology from those sources. There can be no assurance that other organizations will not develop technologies with significant advantages
over those that we are seeking to develop. Any such development could harm our business. 

We
compete with universities and other research institutions engaged in research in these areas. Many of our competitors have greater technical
and financial resources than we do. 

Our
ability to compete successfully is based on numerous factors, including: 

the
 cost-effectiveness of any product that we ultimately commercialize relative to competing products; 

the
 ease of use and ready availability of any product that we bring to market; and 

the
 relative speed with which we are able to bring any product resulting from its research to market in our target markets. 

If
we are unable to distinguish our products from competing products, or if competing products reach the market first, we may be unable
to compete successfully with current or future competitors.

Employees
and Human Capital Resources 

As
of March 1, 2023, we had three full-time officer/employees and one part-time officer/employee. The Company relies to a significant extent
on outside consultants and advisors with various technical skills and expertise that the Company can draw on as necessary to conduct
its research and development and clinical trial programs. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Our future performance
depends significantly upon the continued service of our key personnel and our ability to attract highly skilled employees. We provide
our employees with opportunities for equity ownership. 

Facilities 

As
of March 1, 2023, we do not operate any facilities. We contract out research and development activities, drug production, and drug storage
to various commercial laboratories, drug manufacturers and storage facilities. 

Government
Regulation 

Our
business is subject to the regulations of the FDA as it conducts clinical trials. Clinical trials are research studies to answer specific
questions about new therapies or new ways of using known treatments. Clinical trials determine whether new drugs or treatments are both
safe and effective and the FDA has determined that carefully conducted clinical trials are the fastest and safest way to find treatments
that work in people. 

The
FDA also requires that an independent review body consider the benefits and risks of a clinical trial and grant approval for the proposed
study including selecting of initial doses, plans for escalation of dose, plans for modification of dose if toxicity is encountered,
plans for monitoring the wellbeing of individuals participating in the study, and for defining and measuring, to the extent possible,
any untoward effects related to drug administration. Serious adverse effects, such as life-threatening toxicities and death, are immediately
reportable to the review body and to the FDA. To minimize risk when studying a new drug, the initial dose is well below that expected
to cause any toxicity. No more than three patients are entered at a given dose. In general, a dose is not escalated within an individual
patient. Once safety is established by the absence of toxicity or low toxicity in a group of three patients, a planned higher dose is
then evaluated in a subsequent group of three individuals and so on until dose-limiting toxicity is encountered. The dose level producing
definite but acceptable toxicity is then selected as the dose level to be evaluated in Phase 2 trials. Thus, the goal of Phase 1 studies
is to determine the appropriate dose level for evaluation of drug efficacy in patients with the same type of tumor at comparable stages
of progression for which no beneficial treatment is established. 

In
addition to regulations imposed by the FDA, depending on our future activities, we may become subject to regulation under various federal
and state statutes and regulations, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances
Control Act, the Research Conservation and Recovery Act, national restrictions on technology transfer, and import, export and customs
regulations. From time to time, other federal agencies and congressional committees have indicated an interest in implementing further
regulation of biotechnology applications. We are not able to predict whether any such regulations will be adopted or whether, if adopted,
such regulations will apply to our business, or whether we or our collaborators would be able to comply with any applicable regulations. 

In
addition, as we intend to market our products in international markets, we may be required to obtain separate regulatory approvals from
the European Union and many other foreign jurisdictions. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other
countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries
or by the FDA. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products
in any market. 

Legal
Proceedings 

We
may be involved from time to time in ordinary litigation, negotiation, and settlement matters that will not have a material effect on
our operations or finances. We are not currently party to any material legal proceedings, and we are not aware of any pending or threatened
litigation against us.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

The
following risk factors, together with the other information presented in this document, including the financial statements and the notes
thereto, should be considered by investors. 

Risks
Related to Our Financial Resources and Capital Needs 

We
are engaged in early-stage research and as such might not be successful in our efforts to develop a portfolio of commercially viable
products. 

A
key element of our strategy is to discover new product candidates and develop LB-100 as a monotherapy or combination therapy to treat
cancer. We are seeking to do so through our internal research programs or strategic partnerships. A significant portion of the research
or development that we are conducting involves new and unproven technologies. Research programs to identify new disease targets and product
candidates or to develop them require substantial technical, financial and human resources whether or not any candidates or technologies
are ultimately identified or proven successful. Our research programs might initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates,
yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for the following reasons: 

the
 research methodology used might not be successful in identifying potential product candidates; however, we have identified several
 promising lead candidate compounds which have activity in animal models, one of which, LB-100, has completed a Phase 1 clinical trial;
 or 

product
 candidates for drugs might on further study be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate they are
 unlikely to be effective drugs. 

If
we are unable to discover suitable potential product candidates, develop additional delivery technologies through internal research programs
or strategic partnerships, or in-license suitable products or delivery technologies on acceptable business terms, our business prospects
will suffer. Even if we discover additional product candidates, and even though LB-100 has completed a Phase 1 clinical trial, subsequent
clinical trials of LB-100 or new clinical trials of one or more additional drug candidates may show that these product candidates are
unsafe or ineffective. 

We
have incurred substantial losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial and increasing losses
for the foreseeable future. 

We
are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that uses biomarker technology to identify enzyme targets associated with serious common
diseases and then design novel compounds to attack those threats. We do not have any products approved by a regulatory authority and
have not generated any revenue from collaboration or licensing agreements or product sales to date, and have incurred significant research,
development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations and expect to continue to incur such expenses. As a result, we have
not been profitable and have incurred significant operating losses since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
we reported a net loss of 6,312,535 and 6,728,396, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of
 43,394,699 and 37,082,164, respectively. 

We
do not expect to generate revenues for many years, if at all. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses
for the foreseeable future. We anticipate these losses to increase as we continue to research, develop and seek regulatory approvals
for one or more of our product candidates and any additional product candidates we might acquire, and potentially begin to commercialize
product candidates that might achieve regulatory approval. We might also encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications,
delays and other unknown factors that could adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on
the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenues. Our expenses will further increase as we: 

conduct
 clinical trials of our lead product candidate, LB-100; 

in-license
 or acquire rights to, and pursue development of, other products, product candidates or technologies; 

- 17 - 

hire
 additional clinical, manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and scientific personnel; 

seek
 marketing approval for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; 

develop
 our outsourced manufacturing and commercial activities and establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, if we receive,
 or expect to receive, marketing approval for any product candidates; 

maintain,
 expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and 

add
 operational, financial and management information systems and personnel. 

Our
independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company s consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has no recurring source of revenue
and has experienced negative operating cash flows since inception, and management has stated that substantial doubt exists about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm has included an
explanatory paragraph in their report that accompanies our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December
31, 2022, with respect to this uncertainty. This going concern opinion could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds through
the sale of equity securities in the future, and subsequent reports by our independent registered public accounting firm on our consolidated
financial statements may also include an explanatory paragraph with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern. 

We
need significant additional financing to fund our operations and complete the development and, if approved, the commercialization of
our lead product candidate, LB-100. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our
product development programs or commercialization efforts. 

We
expect that our existing cash resources as of December 31, 2022 will provide sufficient working capital resources to fund our operations,
including our clinical trial programs with respect to the development of our lead anti-cancer clinical compound LB-100, through approximately
December 31, 2023. Our existing cash resources will not be sufficient to complete development of and obtain regulatory approval for our
lead product candidate, and we will need to raise significant additional capital to help us do so. The Company estimates that it will
need to raise additional capital to fund its operations, including its various clinical trial commitments, during the latter part of
the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023. In addition, our operating plan might change as a result of many factors currently unknown
to us, including possible additional clinical trials, and we might need additional funds sooner than planned. 

We
expect to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future to continue the clinical development and manufacturing of our lead
product candidate and the advancement and expansion of our preclinical research pipeline. These expenditures will include costs associated
with research and development, potentially acquiring new product candidates or technologies, conducting preclinical studies and clinical
trials and potentially obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing products, as well as marketing and selling products approved
for sale, if any. 

Budgets
and future capital requirements depend on many factors, including: 

the
 scope, progress, results and costs of our ongoing and planned development programs for our lead product candidate, as well as any
 additional clinical trials we undertake to obtain data sufficient to seek marketing approval for our lead product candidate; 

the
 timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for our lead drug candidate if our clinical trials are successful; 

- 18 - 

the
 cost of commercialization activities for our lead product candidate, if it is approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution
 costs; 

the
 cost of manufacturing our lead product candidate for clinical trials in preparation for regulatory approval, including the cost and
 timing of process development, manufacturing scale-up and validation activities; 

our
 ability to establish and maintain strategic licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements; 

the
 costs to in-license future product candidates or technologies; 

the
 costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, expanding, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation
 costs and the outcome of such litigation; 

the
 costs in defending and resolving future derivative and securities class action litigation; 

our
 operating expenses; and 

the
 emergence of competing technologies or other adverse market developments. 

Additional
funds might not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We have no committed source of additional
capital. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we might not be able to continue as a going concern or we might
be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate preclinical studies, clinical trials or other development activities for our product
candidates or target indications, or delay, limit, reduce or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other
activities that may be necessary to commercialize our lead product candidate. 

We
currently have no source of revenues. We might never generate revenues or achieve profitability. 

Currently,
we do not generate any revenues from product sales or otherwise. Even if we are able to successfully achieve regulatory approval for
our lead product candidate, we do not know when we will generate revenues or become profitable, if at all. Our ability to generate revenues
from product sales and achieve profitability will depend on our ability to successfully commercialize products, including our lead product
candidate, LB-100, and any other product candidates that we might develop, in-license or acquire in the future. Our ability to generate
revenues and achieve profitability also depends on a number of additional factors, including our ability to: 

successfully
 complete development activities, including the necessary clinical trials; 

complete
 and submit New Drug Applications, or NDAs, to the FDA and obtain U.S. regulatory approval for indications for which there is a commercial
 market; 

complete
 and submit applications to foreign regulatory authorities; 

obtain
 regulatory approval in territories with viable market sizes; 

obtain
 coverage and adequate reimbursement from third parties, including government and private payors; 

set
 commercially viable prices for our intended product, if any; 

establish
 and maintain supply and manufacturing relationships with reliable third parties and/or build our own manufacturing facility and ensure
 adequate, legally and globally compliant manufacturing of bulk drug substances and drug products to maintain that supply; 

develop
 distribution processes for our lead product candidate; 

- 19 - 

develop
 commercial quantities of our lead product candidate, once approved, at acceptable cost levels; 

obtain
 additional funding, if required to develop and commercialize our lead product candidate; 

develop
 a commercial organization capable of sales, marketing and distribution for any products we intend to sell ourselves, in the markets
 in which we choose to commercialize on our own; 

achieve
 market acceptance of one or more of our intended products; 

attract,
 hire and retain qualified personnel; and 

protect
 our rights in our intellectual property portfolio. 

Our
revenues for any product candidate for which regulatory approval is obtained will be dependent, in part, upon the size of the markets
in the territories for which it gains regulatory approval, the accepted price for the product, the ability to get reimbursement at any
price, and whether we own the commercial rights for that territory. If the number of our addressable-disease patients is not as significant
as our estimates, the indication approved by regulatory authorities is narrower than we expect, or the reasonably accepted population
for treatment is narrowed by competition, physician choice or treatment guidelines, we might not generate significant revenues from sales
of such products, even if approved. In addition, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved
product candidate. As a result, even if we generate revenues, we might not become profitable and might need to obtain additional funding
to continue operations. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we might be
unable to continue our operations at planned levels and might be forced to reduce our operations. 

Our
ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income might be subject to limitations. 

At
December 31, 2022, the Company has available net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately
 27,803,000 and 28,040,000, respectively. Federal net operating losses from tax years preceding 2018, if not utilized earlier, expire
through 2038. Federal net operating losses generated in a tax year beginning after 2017 have an indefinite carryforward period, but the
deductibility of such federal NOL s may be limited. 

The
state net operating loss carryovers include approximately 19,141,000 that were incurred in the State of New York and approximately 8,899,000
that were incurred in the State of California, which are subject to various restrictions and limitations. 

In
addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and certain corresponding provisions of state law, if a
corporation undergoes an ownership change, which is generally defined as a greater than 50 change, by value, in the ownership
of its equity over a three-year period, the corporation s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change
tax attributes to offset its post-change income might be limited. 

Risks
Related to the Development and Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates 

Clinical-stage
biopharmaceutical companies with product candidates in clinical development face a wide range of challenging activities which might entail
substantial risk. 

We
are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a lead product candidate in clinical development. The success of our lead product
candidate will depend on several factors, including the following: 

designing,
 conducting and successfully completing preclinical development activities, including preclinical efficacy and IND-enabling studies,
 for our lead product candidate or product candidates that we might, in the future, in-license or acquire; 

designing,
 conducting and completing clinical trials with positive results for our lead product candidate; 

- 20 - 

receipt
of regulatory approvals from applicable authorities; 

obtaining
 and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our lead product candidate; 

making
 arrangements with third-party manufacturers, receiving regulatory approval of our manufacturing processes and our third-party manufacturers 
 facilities from applicable regulatory authorities and ensuring adequate supply of drug product; 

manufacturing
 our lead product candidate at an acceptable cost; 

effectively
 launching commercial sales of our lead product candidate, if approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; 

achieving
 acceptance of our lead product candidate, if approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; 

effectively
 competing with other therapies; 

if
 our lead product candidate is approved, obtaining and maintaining coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, including
 government payors, for our lead product candidate; 

complying
 with all applicable regulatory requirements, including FDA current Good Clinical Practices GCP ), current Good Manufacturing
 Practices cGMP ), and standards, rules and regulations governing promotional and other marketing activities; 

maintaining
 a continued acceptable safety profile of the lead product candidate during development and following approval. 

If
we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to
successfully develop and commercialize our lead product candidate, which could materially harm our business. 

We
might find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials which could delay or prevent the start of clinical trials for our product
candidate. 

Identifying
and qualifying patients to participate in clinical trials of our lead product candidate is essential to our success. The timing of our
clinical trials depends in part on the rate at which we can recruit patients to participate in clinical trials of our lead product candidate,
and we might experience delays in our clinical trials if we encounter difficulties in enrollment. If we experience delays in our clinical
trials, the timeline for obtaining regulatory approval of our lead product candidate will most likely be delayed. 

Many
factors might affect our ability to identify, enroll and maintain qualified patients, including the following: 

eligibility
 criteria of our ongoing and planned clinical trials with specific characteristics appropriate for inclusion in our clinical trials; 

design
 of the clinical trial; 

size
 and nature of the patient population; 

- 21 - 

patients 
 perceptions as to risks and benefits of the lead product candidate under study and the participation in a clinical trial generally
 in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that might be approved for the indications we are investigating; 

the
 availability and efficacy of competing therapies and clinical trials; 

pendency
 of other trials underway in the same patient population; 

willingness
 of physicians to participate in our planned clinical trials; 

severity
 of the disease under investigation; 

proximity
 of patients to clinical sites; 

patients
 who are noncompliant or do not otherwise complete the trials; and 

issues
 with contract research organizations (each being a CRO and/or with other vendors that handle 
 our
 clinical trials. 

We
might not be able to initiate or continue to support clinical trials of LB-100, our lead product candidate, for one or more indications,
or any future product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible participants in these trials as
required by the FDA or one or more other regulatory authorities. Even if we are able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our
clinical trials, if the pace of enrollment is slower than we expect, the development costs for our lead product candidate might increase
and the completion of our trials might be delayed or our trials could become too expensive to complete. 

If
we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trials of our lead product candidate, the commercial prospects
of our lead product candidate could be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenue from any of our product candidates could be
delayed or prevented. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials would likely increase our overall costs, impair product
candidate development and jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval relative to our current plans. Any of these occurrences
might harm our business, financial condition, and prospects significantly. 

The
results of preclinical studies or earlier clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results. Our lead product candidate
in clinical trials, and any other product candidates that might advance into clinical trials, might not have favorable results in later
clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. 

Success
in preclinical studies and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate adequate data to demonstrate
the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including
those with greater resources and experience than we have, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after seeing promising
results in earlier preclinical studies or clinical trials. 

Despite
the results reported in earlier preclinical studies or clinical trials for our lead product candidate, we do not know whether the clinical
trials that we might conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market our lead product
candidate for a particular indication, in any particular jurisdiction. Efficacy data from prospectively designed trials might differ
significantly from those obtained from retrospective subgroup analyses. If later-stage clinical trials do not produce favorable results,
our ability to achieve regulatory approval for our lead product candidate might be adversely impacted. Even if we believe that we have
adequate data to support an application for regulatory approval to market our lead product candidate or any future product candidates,
the FDA or other regulatory authorities might not agree and might require that we conduct additional clinical trials.

Clinical
drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome. 

Clinical
testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, with the outcome inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during
the clinical trial process. Before obtaining approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of our lead product candidate, we must
conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our lead product candidate in humans. Prior to initiating
clinical trials, a sponsor must complete extensive preclinical testing of a product candidate, including, in most cases, preclinical
efficacy experiments as well as IND-enabling toxicology studies. These experiments and studies might be time-consuming and expensive
to complete. The necessary preclinical testing might not be completed successfully for a preclinical product candidate and a potentially
promising product candidate might therefore never be tested in humans. Once it commences, clinical testing is expensive, difficult to
design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur
at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials might not be predictive of the success of later
clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, preclinical and clinical
data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed
satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products. We
might experience numerous unforeseen events during drug development that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval
or commercialize our lead product candidate. In particular, clinical trials of our lead product candidate might produce inconclusive
or negative results. We have limited data regarding the safety, tolerability and efficacy of our lead product candidate. Clinical trials
also require the review and oversight of an institutional review board IRB ). An inability or delay in obtaining IRB approval
could prevent or delay the initiation and completion of clinical trials, and the FDA might decide not to consider any data or information
derived from a clinical investigation not subject to initial and continuing IRB review and approval. 

We
might experience delays in our ongoing or future clinical trials, and we do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin or enroll
subjects on time, will need to be redesigned or will be completed on schedule, if at all. There can be no assurance that the FDA or another
regulatory agency will not put clinical trials of our lead product candidate on hold in the future. Clinical trials might be delayed,
suspended or prematurely terminated for a variety of reasons, such as: 

delay
 or failure in reaching agreement with the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority on a clinical trial design that we are able to execute; 

delay
 or failure in obtaining authorization to commence a trial or inability to comply with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority
 regarding the scope or design of a trial; 

delay
 or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject
 to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites; 

delay
 or failure in obtaining IRB approval or the approval of other reviewing entities, including comparable foreign regulatory authorities,
 to conduct a clinical trial at each site; 

withdrawal
 of clinical trial sites from our clinical trials or the ineligibility of a site to participate in our clinical trials; 

delay
 or failure in recruiting and enrolling suitable subjects to participate in a trial; 

delay
 or failure in subjects completing a trial or returning for post-treatment follow-up; 

clinical
 sites and investigators deviating from trial protocol, failing to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, or
 dropping out of a trial; 

inability
 to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs,
 including some that may be for the same indication; 

- 23 - 

failure
 of our third-party clinical trial managers, CROs, clinical trial sites, contracted laboratories or other third-party vendors to satisfy
 their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or return trustworthy data; 

delay
 or failure in adding new trial sites; 

interim
 results or data that are ambiguous or negative or are inconsistent with earlier results or data; 

alteration
 of trial design necessitated by re-evaluation of design assumptions based upon observed data; 

feedback
 from the FDA, the IRB or a foreign regulatory authority, or results from earlier stage or concurrent preclinical studies and clinical
 trials, that might require modification to the protocol for a trial; 

a
 decision by the FDA, the IRB, a foreign regulatory authority, or us to suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for safety
 issues or for any other reason; 

unacceptable
 risk-benefit profile, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects; 

failure
 to demonstrate a benefit from using a product candidate; 

difficulties
 in manufacturing, obtaining, from one or more third parties, or qualifying sufficient quantities of a product candidate to start
 or to use in clinical trials; 

lack
 of adequate funding to continue a trial, including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct
 additional studies or increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties; or 

changes
 in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue a clinical trial. 

If
we experience delays in the completion or termination of any clinical trial of our lead product candidate, the approval and commercial
prospects of our lead product candidate will be harmed, delaying our ability to generate product revenues from such product candidate
and our costs will most likely increase. The required regulatory approvals may also be delayed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to commence
product sales and generate revenues and the period of commercial exclusivity for our intended product may be shortened. Regulatory approval
of our lead product candidate may be denied for the same reasons that caused the delay. 

Risks
associated with operating in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our product development. 

We
have entered into an agreement to conduct a clinical trial in Spain. Consequently, we will also be subject to risks related to operating
in foreign countries. Risks associated with conducting operations in foreign countries include: 

differing
 regulatory requirements for drug approvals and regulation of approved drugs in foreign countries; 

more
stringent privacy requirements for data to be supplied to our operations in the United States, but generated outside the United States,
 e.g. , General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union; 

unexpected
 changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements; 

economic
 weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign countries, economies or markets; 

compliance
 with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad; 

foreign
 taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes; 

- 24 - 

differing
 payor reimbursement regimes, governmental payors or patient self-pay systems and price controls; 

foreign
 currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses or reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to
 doing business or operating in another country; 

workforce
 uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States; 

production
 shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and 

business
 interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions or events, including civil or political unrest (such as the ongoing conflict between
 Ukraine and Russia), sanctions, war and terrorism. 

Our
current and future product candidates, the methods used to deliver them or their dosage levels may cause undesirable side effects or
have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label or result
in significant negative consequences following any regulatory approval. 

Undesirable
side effects caused by our current or future product candidates, their delivery methods or dosage levels could cause us, our collaborators
or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial
of regulatory approval or termination of clinical trials by the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities; or an IRB, that approves
and, monitors biomedical research to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects. As a result of safety or toxicity issues that
we might experience in our clinical trials, or negative or inconclusive results from the clinical trials of others for drug candidates
that might be similar to our own, we might not receive approval to market our current lead product candidate or any product candidates
we may pursue, which could prevent us from ever generating revenues or achieving profitability. Results of our trials could reveal an
unacceptably high severity or incidence of side effects. In such an event, our trials or those or our collaborators could be suspended
or terminated, and the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities could order us or our collaborators to cease further development of or deny
approval of our current or any future product candidates for any or all targeted indications. Any drug-related side effects could also
affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled subjects to complete clinical trials or result in potential product liability claims.
Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows
and future prospects. 

Additionally,
if our lead product candidate receives regulatory approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such product,
a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including that: 

we
 may be forced to suspend marketing of such product; 

regulatory
 authorities might withdraw their approvals of such product; 

regulatory
 authorities might require additional warnings on the label that could diminish the usage or otherwise limit the commercial success
 of such product; 

we
 may be required to conduct post-marketing studies; 

we
 may be required to change the way the product is administered; 

we
 could be sued and held liable for harm caused to subjects or patients; and 

our
 reputation may suffer. 

Any
of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of our lead product candidate, if approved. 

- 25 - 

Our
product development program might not uncover all possible adverse events that patients who take our lead product candidate may experience.
The number of subjects exposed to our lead product candidate and the average exposure time in the clinical development program might
be inadequate to detect rare adverse events or chance findings that might only be detected once the product is administered to more patients
and for greater periods of time. 

Clinical
trials by their nature utilize a sample of the potential patient population. However, with a limited number of subjects and limited duration
of exposure, we cannot be fully assured that rare and severe side effects of our lead product candidate will be uncovered. Such rare
and severe side effects might only be uncovered with a significantly larger number of patients exposed to our lead product candidate.
If such safety problems occur or are identified after our lead product candidate reaches the market, the FDA might require that we amend
the labeling of the product or recall the product, or might even withdraw approval for the product. 

Our
future success is dependent on the regulatory approval of our lead product candidate. 

Our
business is dependent on our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our lead product candidate in a timely manner. We cannot commercialize
our lead product candidate in the United States without first obtaining regulatory approval for the product from the FDA. Similarly,
we cannot commercialize our lead product candidate outside of the United States without obtaining regulatory approval from one or more
foreign regulatory authorities. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our lead product candidate for a target
indication, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence gathered in preclinical studies and clinical trials, that the product candidate
is safe and effective for use for that target indication and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate with
respect to such product candidate. 

The
time required to obtain approval by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following
the commencement of preclinical studies and clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of
the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval
may change during the course of a product candidate s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. 

Even
if a product candidate were to successfully obtain approval from the FDA and one or more foreign regulatory authorities, any approval
might contain significant limitations related to use restrictions for specified age groups, warnings, precautions or contraindications,
or may be subject to burdensome post-approval study or risk management requirements. Also, any regulatory approval of our lead product
candidate or any future product candidates we may pursue, once obtained, may be withdrawn. 

Our
lead product candidate and future product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval from the FDA. 

We
have not obtained regulatory approval for our lead product candidate, and it is possible that our lead product candidate or any future
product candidates will not obtain regulatory approval, for many reasons, including: 

disagreement
 with the regulatory authorities regarding the scope, design or implementation of our clinical trials; 

failure
 to demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and effective for our proposed indication; 

failure
 of clinical trials to meet the level of statistical significance required for approval; 

failure
 to demonstrate that a product candidate s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks; 

disagreement
 with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials; 

the
 insufficiency of data collected from clinical trials of our lead product candidate to support the submission and filing of an NDA
 or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval; 

- 26 - 

failure
 to obtain approval of our manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with whom we contract for clinical and
 commercial supplies or our own manufacturing facility; or 

changes
 in the approval policies or regulations that render our preclinical and clinical data insufficient for approval. 

The
FDA or a foreign regulatory authority might require more information, including additional preclinical or clinical data, to support approval
or additional studies, which might delay or prevent approval or our commercialization plans, or we might decide to abandon the development
program. The FDA or a foreign regulatory authority might also require the manufacture of a new lead product candidate in accordance with
new or revised standards. If we were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities might approve our lead product candidate and any future
product candidates we might pursue for fewer or more limited indications than we request (including failing to approve the most commercially
promising indications), might grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or might approve
a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization
of that product candidate. 

If
we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for our lead product candidate in one or more jurisdictions, or if any approval contains
significant limitations, we might not be able to obtain sufficient funding to continue the development of that product or generate revenues
attributable to that product candidate. 

Failure
to obtain regulatory approval in international jurisdictions would prevent our lead product candidate from being marketed abroad. 

In
addition to regulations in the United States, to market and sell our lead product candidate in the European Union, in the United Kingdom,
in many Asian countries and in other jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying
regulatory requirements. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions,
and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries
or jurisdictions or by the FDA. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated
with obtaining FDA approval as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of local regulations in foreign jurisdictions. The approval
procedure varies among countries and can require additional data or involve additional testing. The time required to obtain foreign approval
may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. We might not be able to obtain approvals from regulatory authorities
outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Clinical trials accepted in one country might not be accepted by regulatory authorities
in other countries. In addition, many countries outside the United States require that a product be approved for reimbursement before
it can be approved for sale in that country. A product candidate that has been approved for sale in a particular country might not receive
reimbursement approval in that country. 

We
might not be able to file for regulatory approvals and might not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our intended product in
any market. If we are unable to obtain approval of any of our current product candidate or any future product candidates we might pursue
by regulatory authorities in the European Union, United Kingdom, Asia or elsewhere, the commercial prospects of that product candidate
might be significantly diminished, our business prospects could decline and this could materially adversely affect our business, results
of operations and financial condition. 

Even
if our current primary product candidate received regulatory approval, it might still face future development and regulatory difficulties. 

Even
if we obtain regulatory approval for our lead product candidate, LB-100, that approval would be subject to ongoing requirements by the
FDA and foreign regulatory authorities governing the manufacture, quality control, further development, labeling, packaging, storage,
distribution, adverse event reporting, safety surveillance, import, export, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety
and other post-marketing information. These requirements can include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports,
registration, as well as continued compliance by us and/or our CMOs and CROs for any post-approval clinical trials that we or our collaborators
might conduct. The safety profile of any product will continue to be closely monitored by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities
after approval. If the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities become aware of new safety information after approval of our lead product
candidate, they might require labeling changes or establishment of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, impose significant restrictions
on such product s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market
surveillance. 

- 27 - 

In
addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and
other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP, GCP, and other regulations. If we, a collaborator or a regulatory agency discover
previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility
where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency might impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including
requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. If we, our lead product candidate or the
manufacturing facilities for our lead product candidate fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency might: 

issue
 warning letters or untitled letters; 

mandate
 modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners; 

require
 us to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due
 dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance; 

seek
 an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines; 

suspend
 or withdraw regulatory approval; 

suspend
 any ongoing clinical trials; 

refuse
 to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us or a collaborator; 

suspend
 or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or 

seize
 or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall. 

The
occurrence of any event or penalty described above might inhibit our ability to successfully commercialize our intended product and generate
revenues. 

Advertising
and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval in the United States is heavily scrutinized by the FDA, the Department of
Justice, the Office of Inspector General of Health and Human Services, state attorneys general, members of Congress and the public. A
company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance
with the provisions of the approved label. Additionally, advertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval outside
of the United States is heavily scrutinized by foreign regulatory authorities. Violations, including actual or alleged promotion of our
intended product for unapproved or off-label uses, are subject to enforcement letters, inquiries and investigations, and civil and criminal
sanctions by the FDA, as well as prosecution under the federal False Claims Act. Any actual or alleged failure to comply with labeling
and promotion requirements can have a negative impact on our business. 

- 28 - 

Risks
Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties 

We
depend on certain key scientific personnel for our success who do not work full time for us. The loss of any such personnel could adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our
success depends on the continued availability and contributions of our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. John S. Kovach. Dr. Kovach
is 85 years old and is being treated for recurrent asymptomatic prostate cancer. The loss of services of Dr. Kovach could delay or reduce
our product development and commercialization efforts and would require that we hire a qualified replacement to fill the position of
the Chief Executive Officer. Furthermore, recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel to perform future research and development
work is critical to our success. Our inability to attract or retain qualified personnel or advisors in the future could significantly
weaken our management, harm our ability to compete effectively, and harm our business. The competition for qualified personnel in the
pharmaceutical field is intense and, as a result, we might be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development
of our business. 

During
September 2015, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with BioPharmaWorks, pursuant to which we engaged BioPharmaWorks to perform
certain services for us. Those services include, among other things: (a) assisting us to (i) commercialize our intended products and
strengthen our patent portfolio, (ii) identify pharmaceutical companies with potential interest in our product pipeline, and (iii) prepare
and deliver presentations concerning our product candidates; (b) at the request of the Board of Directors, serving as backup management
for up to three months should our Chief Executive Officer and scientific leader be temporarily unable to carry out his duties; (c) being
available for consultation in drug discovery and development; and (d) identifying providers and overseeing tasks relating to clinical
use and commercialization of new compounds. BioPharmaWorks was founded in 2015 by former Pfizer scientists with extensive multi-disciplinary
research and development and drug development experience. The Collaboration Agreement automatically renews annually unless either party
elects to terminate it. The Collaboration Agreement is currently in effect. 

Additionally,
we employ Dr. James S. Miser as Chief Medical Officer and promoted Eric J. Forman to Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. For
the foreseeable future, Dr. Miser is working with us on a half-time basis. We believe that this Collaboration Agreement with BioPharmaWorks
and the presence of Dr. Miser and Mr. Forman mitigate, to a certain extent, our reliance on the services of Dr. Kovach, and would allow
us the time to replace Dr. Kovach in the event that such a need arose. 

We
expect to rely heavily on third parties for the conduct of clinical trials of our product candidates. If these clinical trials are not
successful, or if we or our collaborators are not able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize
our product candidates. 

In
order to obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of our product candidates, we or our collaborators will be required to complete
extensive preclinical studies as well as clinical trials in humans to demonstrate to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities that
our product candidates are safe and effective. 

Dr.
Kovach is experienced in the design and conduct of early clinical cancer trials, having been the lead investigator for a National Cancer
Institute Phase 1 clinical trial contract for ten years at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. However, we have no experience in conducting
clinical trials and expect to rely heavily on collaborative partners and CROs for their performance and management of clinical trials
of our product candidates. 

Our
intended products under development might not be effective in treating any of our targeted disorders or might prove to have undesirable
or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that might prevent or limit their commercial use. Institutional review
boards or regulators, including the FDA, might hold, suspend or terminate our clinical research or the clinical trials of our product
candidates for various reasons, including non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if, in their opinion, the participating subjects
are being exposed to unacceptable health risks. Additionally, failure of third parties conducting or overseeing the operation of the
clinical trials to perform their contractual or regulatory obligations in a timely fashion could delay the clinical trials. Failure of
clinical trials can occur at any stage. Any of these events would adversely affect our ability to market a product candidate. 

The
development process necessary to obtain regulatory approval is lengthy, complex and costly. If we or our collaborative partners do not
obtain necessary regulatory approvals, then our business would not be successful, and the market price of our common stock could decline
substantially. 

- 29 - 

To
the extent that we, or our collaborative partners, are able to successfully advance a product candidate through the clinic, we, or such
partner, will be required to obtain regulatory approval prior to marketing and selling such product. The process of obtaining FDA and
other required regulatory approvals is costly and lengthy. The time required for FDA and other approvals is uncertain and can typically
take several or many years, depending on the complexity and novelty of the product. 

Any
regulatory approval to market a product might be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we, or our collaborative partners,
may market the product. These limitations might restrict the size of the market for the product and affect reimbursement by third-party
payors. In addition, regulatory agencies might not grant approvals on a timely basis or might revoke or significantly modify previously
granted approvals. 

We,
or our collaborative partners, also are subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing the manufacturing and marketing
of our potential future products outside of the United States. The approval procedure varies among countries, additional testing might
be required in some jurisdictions, and the time required to obtain foreign approvals often differs from that required to obtain FDA approvals.
Moreover, approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and vice versa. 

As
a result of these factors, we, or our collaborative partners, might not successfully complete clinical trials in the time periods estimated,
if at all. Moreover, if we, or our collaborative partners, incur unanticipated costs and/or delays in development programs or if we fail
to successfully develop and commercialize products based upon our technologies, we might not be able to generate significant operating
revenues or sustainable profitability, as a result of which our stock price could decline substantially. 

Business
interruptions could adversely affect future operations, revenues, and financial conditions, and might increase our costs and expenses. 

Our
operations, and those of our directors, advisors, contractors, consultants, CROs, and collaborators, could be adversely affected by earthquakes,
floods, hurricanes, typhoons, extreme weather conditions, fires, water shortages, power failures, business systems failures, medical
epidemics and other natural and man-made disaster or business interruptions. Our phones, electronic devices and computer systems and
those of our directors, advisors, contractors, consultants, CROs, and collaborators are vulnerable to damages, theft and accidental loss,
negligence, unauthorized access, terrorism, war, electronic and telecommunications failures, and other natural and man-made disasters.
Operating as a virtual company, our employees conduct business outside of our headquarters and leased or owned facilities. These locations
might be subject to additional security and other risk factors due to the limited control of our employees. If such an event as described
above were to occur in the future, it might cause interruptions in our operations, delay research and development programs, clinical
trials, regulatory activities, manufacturing and quality assurance activities, sales and marketing activities, hiring, training of employees
and persons within associated third parties, and other business activities. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed
or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or
reproduce the data. 

Likewise,
we will rely on third parties to manufacture our product candidates and conduct clinical trials, and similar events as those described
in the prior paragraph relating to their business systems, equipment and facilities could also have a material adverse effect on our
business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or
misappropriation or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization
of our lead product candidate could be delayed or altogether terminated. 

- 30 - 

Our
failure to find third party collaborators to assist or share in the costs of product development could materially harm our business,
financial condition or results of operations. 

Our
strategy for the development and commercialization of our proprietary product candidates might include the formation of collaborative
arrangements with third parties. We have entered into a number of agreements with third parties as described below under Business, 
including a clinical trial research agreement with H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Inc.; a collaboration agreement
with the Spanish Sarcoma Group; a cooperative research and development agreement with the National Cancer Institute; and a clinical research
support agreement with City of Hope National Medical Center. Existing and future collaborators have significant discretion in determining
the efforts and resources they apply and might not perform their obligations as expected. Potential third-party collaborators include
biopharmaceutical, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other entities. Third-party
collaborators may assist us in: 

funding
 research, preclinical development, clinical trials and manufacturing; 

seeking and obtaining regulatory
 approvals; and 

successfully commercializing
 any future product candidates. 

If
we are not able to establish further collaboration agreements, we might be required to undertake product development and commercialization
at our own expense. Such an undertaking might limit the number of product candidates that we will be able to develop, significantly increase
our capital requirements and place additional strain on our internal resources. Our failure to enter into additional collaborations could
materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

In
addition, our dependence on licensing, collaboration and other agreements with third parties might subject us to a number of risks. If
we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, of if one or more third parties allege that we fail to comply, then one
or more third parties might terminate the agreements. In this event, we might not be able to develop, manufacture or market our product
candidates. This would materially adversely affect our business prospects. 

These
agreements might not be on terms that prove favorable to us and might require us to relinquish certain rights in our product candidates.
To the extent we agree to work exclusively with one collaborator in a particular territory, research area, or therapeutic field of use,
our opportunities to collaborate with other entities could be curtailed. Lengthy negotiations with potential new collaborators might
lead to delays in the research, development or commercialization of product candidates. The decision by our collaborators to pursue alternative
technologies or the failure of our collaborators to develop or commercialize successfully any product candidate to which they have obtained
rights from us could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

In
addition, our agreements might not be assignable by us without the consent of the respective other party or parties, which might limit
or delay our ability to consummate transactions, adversely impact the value of those transactions, or limit our ability to pursue research,
development or other activities. 

We
might be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees, consultants, collaborators contractors or we have misappropriated
their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property. 

Our
employees, consultants, collaborators or contractors have been previously employed at universities or third-party pharmaceutical companies,
including our actual or possible competitors, and received confidential and proprietary information from them. Although we try to ensure
that our employees, consultants, collaborators or contractors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work
for us, we may be subject to claims that these employees, consultants, collaborators or contractors, or we, have used or disclosed intellectual
property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any former employer. We might also be subject to claims that former
employers or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.
We might not be successful in defending these claims, and if we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages,
we could lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property.
Even if we are successful, litigation could result in substantial cost and reputational loss and be a distraction to our business. 

In
addition, while it is our policy to require our employees, consultants, collaborators and contractors who may be involved in the development
of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we might be unsuccessful in executing such
an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Such assignment agreements might not
be self-executing or may be breached, and we might be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that third parties
might bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.

Risks
Related to Our Intellectual Property 

We
cannot be certain we will be able to obtain patent protection to protect our product candidates and technology. 

Our
patents and patent applications are owned solely by our subsidiary Lixte Biotechnology, Inc., except in two instances jointly with one
of our collaborators. 

The
patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we might not be able to file or prosecute all necessary or desirable
patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects
of our research or development before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Therefore, these patents and applications might not
be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. 

The
patent position of pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent
years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries might not protect our rights to the same extent
as the laws of the United States. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and
patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until after filing, or in some cases not
at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our solely owned or jointly
owned patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first inventors to file for patent protection of such inventions. As
a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and
future patent applications might not result in patents being issued that protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or
that effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in the patent laws or their interpretation
by courts or patent offices might diminish the value of our patents or patent applications, or narrow their scope. 

The
issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, term, validity or enforceability, and our solely or jointly owned
patents might be challenged in a U.S. or non-U.S. court or patent office. Such challenges might result in loss of exclusivity or in patent
claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using
or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and
products. Given the amount of time required for research, development, testing or regulatory review of product candidates, patents protecting
such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are approved or commercialized. As a result, our solely or jointly
owned patents might not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing intended products similar or identical
to ours. 

We
cannot be certain that all patents applied for will be issued. If a third party has also filed a patent application relating to an invention
claimed by us, solely or jointly with one of our collaborators, we might be required to participate in an interference or derivation
proceeding declared or instituted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, which could result in substantial uncertainties and
cost for us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain.
For example: 

we, solely
 or jointly with our collaborators, might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by our pending or future patent applications; 

we, solely or jointly with
 our collaborators, might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions; 

others might independently
 develop identical, similar or alternative technologies; 

- 32 - 

it
 is possible that our patent applications will not result in an issued patent or patents, or that the scope of protection granted
 by any patents arising from our patent applications will be significantly narrower than expected; 

we might be unaware of prior art that renders one or more of our patent applications unpatentable or one or more of our patents invalid; 

a court might determine that we failed to disclose to a patent office prior art that we were aware of and that is material to patentability
 and, therefore, conclude that one or more of our patents are unenforceable; 

any
 patents under which we hold rights might not cover commercially viable products, might not provide us with any competitive advantages
 or might be challenged by one or more third parties as being not infringed, being invalid, or being unenforceable under United States
 or foreign laws; 

a court or patent office might determine that two or more of our patents claim patentably indistinct subject matter, which could
 adversely affect one or more of the patents the term, validity or enforceability; 

a court or patent office
 might determine that one or more patents issued to us in the future or under which we hold rights are invalid or unenforceable; or 

we might develop additional
 proprietary technologies that are not patentable and which might not be adequately protected through trade secrets or know-how. 

In
addition, we solely or jointly own patents or patent applications in jurisdictions having, or that might in the future have, geopolitical
disputes, including over sovereignty. We cannot guarantee that patents granted in these jurisdictions will be enforceable. An inability
to enforce patents in these jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

If
we do not obtain patent term extension in the United States under the Hatch-Waxman Act or in foreign countries under similar legislation,
our business might be materially harmed. 

In
the United States, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug, its method for use or method for manufacture, can be eligible
for patent term extension. U.S. law provides a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent for time
during which the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years
from the date of regulatory approval; only one patent can be extended for the same regulatory review period; and the scope of a patent s
enforceability during a patent term extension is limited to the scope of FDA approval. There is no guarantee that the relevant agencies,
including the United States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO ), will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions
should be granted, and even if granted, the term of these extensions. We might not be granted patent term extension in the United States
or in any foreign country because of, for example, expiration of our patents before obtaining regulatory approval, failing to exercise
due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior
to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of a patent term extension,
as well as the scope of patent protection during any such extension, afforded by the governmental authority could be less than we request.
If we are unable to obtain any patent term extension or if the term of any such extension is less than we request, our competitors might
obtain approval of competing products following the expiration of our patent rights, and our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects could be materially harmed. 

It
is possible that we will not obtain patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act for a U.S. patent covering any of our product candidates
that we may identify even where that patent is eligible for patent term extension, or if we obtain such an extension, it may be for a
shorter period than we had sought. 

If
we fail to comply with our obligations in agreements under which we have licensed or, might license, intellectual property rights from
third parties, or if we otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose rights that
are important to our business. 

We
have entered into, and might in the future enter into, one or more intellectual property license agreements that are important to our
business. These license agreements might impose various diligence, milestone payment, royalty and other obligations on us. For example,
we might be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to engage in various development and commercialization activities with respect
to licensed products, and might need to satisfy specified milestone and royalty payment obligations. If we fail to comply with any obligations
under our agreements with any of these licensors, we might be subject to termination of the license agreement in whole or in part, increased
financial obligations to our licensors or loss of exclusivity in a particular field or territory, in which case our ability to develop
or commercialize products covered by the license agreement will be impaired. 

- 33 - 

In
addition, disputes might arise regarding intellectual property subject to a license agreement, including: 

the scope of
 rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues; 

whether our technology,
 product candidates or processes infringe intellectual property rights that are owned by the licensor, but that are not subject to
 the licensing agreement; 

our diligence obligations
 under the license agreement and the activities that satisfy those obligations; 

whether we are required
 to sublicense to a third party rights that the license grants to us, but that we do not commercially pursue; and 

the ownership of inventions,
 data and know-how resulting from joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us. 

If
disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed, or might in the future license, prevent or impair our ability to maintain
our licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize the affected product candidates. 

We
might need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates. We may
fail to obtain any of these licenses at a commercially reasonable cost or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Other companies
might have a competitive advantage over us due to their larger size or cash resources or greater clinical development and commercialization
capabilities. We might be unable to further develop or commercialize one or more of our product candidates, which could harm our business
significantly. 

We
might infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may prevent or delay our product development efforts and stop us from
commercializing or increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates. 

Our
success will depend in part on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We cannot guarantee
that our intended products or our product candidates, or manufacture or use of our intended products or our product candidates, will
not infringe third-party patents. Furthermore, a third party might claim that we are using without permission one or more inventions
covered by the third party s patent rights and might go to court to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities,
including making, offering to sell or selling our product candidates. Still further a third party might go to court seeking judgment
that our patents are invalid or unenforceable. These lawsuits are costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention
of managerial and scientific personnel. Some of these third parties might be better capitalized and have more resources than us. There
is a risk that a court would decide that we are infringing the third party s patents and would order us to stop the activities
covered by the patents. In that event, we might not have a viable way around the patent and might need to halt commercialization of the
relevant product candidate. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us to pay the other party damages for having violated
the other party s patents. There is also a risk that a court would decide that one or more of our patents are invalid or unenforceable.
In addition, we might be obligated to indemnify our licensors and collaborators against intellectual property infringement claims brought
by third parties, which could require us to expend additional resources. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have produced
a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products
or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. 

- 34 - 

We
cannot guarantee that we have identified all third-party patents or pending patent applications that are or might be necessary for the
commercialization of our intended products and technologies in any jurisdiction. Patent applications in the United States and elsewhere
are not published until approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed, with such earliest filing date
being commonly referred to as the priority date. Therefore, patent applications covering our technologies and intended products could
have been filed by others without our knowledge. 

Additionally,
pending patent applications that have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover
our technologies or intended products. The scope of a patent claim is determined by the interpretation of the law, the words of a patent
claim, the written disclosure in a patent and the patent s prosecution history. Our interpretation of the relevance or the scope
of a patent or a pending patent application may be incorrect, which may negatively impact our ability to market our intended products.
We might incorrectly determine that our technologies or intended products are not covered by a third-party patent or might incorrectly
predict whether a third party s pending patent application will issue with claims of relevant scope. Our determination of the expiration
date of any patent in the United States or abroad that we consider relevant might be incorrect, and we might incorrectly conclude that
a third-party patent does not cover our technology or intended products, is invalid or is unenforceable. Our inability to identify or
correctly interpret relevant patents might negatively impact our ability to develop or market our technologies or intended products.
If we fail to identify or correctly interpret relevant patents, we might be subject to infringement claims. We cannot guarantee that
we will be able to successfully settle or otherwise resolve such infringement claims. If we fail in any such dispute, in addition to
being liable for damages, we might be temporarily or permanently enjoined or otherwise prohibited from commercializing any of technologies
or intended products that are held to be infringing. We might, if possible, also be forced to redesign intended products or product formulations
so that we no longer infringe the third-party intellectual property rights. Any of these events, even if we were ultimately to prevail,
could require us to divert substantial financial and management resources that we would otherwise be able to devote to our business. 

As
the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates or intended
products give rise to claims of infringement of the patent rights of others. There may be third-party patents of which we are currently
unaware with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of
our product candidates. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods either do not
infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid or unenforceable, negotiate and obtain a license
under reasonable terms to us or discontinue performing the allegedly infringing activities. We might not be able to do any of these.
Proving invalidity is difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence
to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we might incur substantial
costs and divert management s time and attention in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
If we are unable to avoid infringing the patent rights of others, we might be required to seek a license, which might not be available,
and then we will have to defend an infringement action, challenge the validity of the patents in the USPTO or in court, or discontinue
performing the allegedly infringing activities. Patent litigation is costly and time consuming. We might not have sufficient resources
to bring these actions to a successful conclusion. In addition, if we do not obtain a license, develop or obtain non-infringing technology,
fail to defend an infringement action successfully or fail to have infringed patents declared invalid or unenforceable, we might incur
substantial monetary damages, encounter significant delays in bringing our product candidates to market and be precluded from manufacturing
or selling our product candidates. 

We
cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending applications, that we were the
first to invent the technology or that we were the first to file patent applications covering our technology, because: 

some patent
 applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued; 

patent applications in
 the United States are typically not published until 18 months after their earliest claimed priority date; and 

publications in the scientific
 literature often lag behind actual discoveries. 

- 35 - 

Our
competitors might have filed, and might in the future file, patent applications covering technology similar or identical to ours. Any
such patent applications might dominate our patent applications, which could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering
such technologies. If another party has filed US patent applications that cover inventions similar or identical to ours and claim priority
to any applications filed prior to the priority dates of our applications, we might have to participate in an interference proceeding
declared or a derivation proceed instituted by the USPTO to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these
proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful if the other party had independently arrived
at the same or similar inventions before us, possibly resulting in a loss of our U.S. patent position with respect to such inventions.
Other countries might have similar laws that permit secrecy of patent applications. Either way, the third party s patents or patent
applications might be entitled to priority over our applications in such jurisdictions. 

Some
of our competitors might be able to sustain the costs of a patent challenge more effectively than we can because they have substantially
greater resources. In addition, uncertainties regarding the outcome of the challenge could have a material adverse effect on our ability
to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations. 

We
might be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade
secrets of one or more third parties. 

As
is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, we employ, and might employ in the future, individuals who were previously
employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure
that our employees, consultants and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work
for us, we might be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise
used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation might be necessary to defend against
these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we could lose valuable intellectual property
rights or personnel, which could adversely impact our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation
could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. 

Our
intellectual property might not be sufficient to protect our intended products from competition, which might negatively affect our business
as well as limit our partnership or acquisition appeal. 

We
might be subject to competition despite the existence of intellectual property we license or own. We can give no assurance that our intellectual
property claims will be sufficient to prevent third parties from designing around patents we own or license and developing and commercializing
competitive products. The existence of competitive products that avoid our intellectual property could materially adversely affect our
operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, any actual or perceived limitations, in our intellectual property might lessen
the interest of third parties to partner, collaborate or otherwise transact with us, if third parties perceive a higher than acceptable
risk to commercialization of our intended products or future products. 

Our
approach includes filing patent applications covering combination therapy with known, studied and/or marketed drugs. Although the protection
afforded by our patent applications might be significant, when looking at our patents ability to block competition, the protection
offered by our patents might be, to some extent, more limited than protection provided by patents claiming a composition of matter that
is entirely new and previously unknown. If a competitor were able to successfully design around any combination therapy patents we have
or might have in the future, our business and competitive advantage could be significantly affected. 

We
might elect to sue a third party, or otherwise make a claim, alleging infringement or other violation of patents, trademarks, trade dress,
copyrights, trade secrets, domain names or other intellectual property rights that we either own or license. We might alternatively elect
to sue a third party, or otherwise make a claim, alleging that we don t infringe a third party s patents or that the third
party s patents are invalid or unenforceable. Any claims that we assert against a third party could provoke the third party to
assert one or more counterclaims against us, for example, alleging that we infringe their patents. In addition, in a patent infringement
proceeding, a court might decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part; construe the patent s
claims narrowly; or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue. Any litigation proceeding could put one or more
of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly. Even if we prevail in a lawsuit, a court might
not award remedies that sufficiently compensate us for our losses. 

- 36 - 

If
we do not prevail in either type of litigation, we might be subject to: 

paying monetary
 damages related to the legal expenses of the third party; 

facing additional competition
 that might have a significant adverse effect on our intended-product pricing, market share, business operations, financial condition,
 and the commercial viability of our intended products; and 

restructuring our company
 or delaying or terminating select business opportunities, including, but not limited to, research and development, clinical trials,
 and commercialization activities, due to a potential deterioration of our financial condition or market competitiveness. 

A
third party might also challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of the intellectual property rights that we license or own, and
the result of these challenges might narrow the scope or claims of or invalidate patents that are integral to our product candidates
in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully defend patents we own in an action against third parties
due to the unpredictability of litigation and the high costs associated with intellectual property litigation, among other factors. 

The
laws of some jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws or rules and regulations of the
United States, and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in non-U.S. jurisdictions.
The legal systems of some countries are less supportive of enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection,
than the United States. This could make it difficult for us to enforce our patents or market competing products outside the United States,
in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in non-U.S. jurisdictions, whether or not
successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our
patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third
parties to assert claims against us. We might not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded,
if any, might not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights in all jurisdictions
where we have the rights might be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop
or license. Furthermore, while we seek to protect our intellectual property rights in significant markets, we cannot ensure that we will
be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we might wish to market our intended products or our product
candidates. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries might be inadequate, which might have
an adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates in all of our expected significant foreign markets.
If we or our licensors encounter difficulties in protecting, or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting, the intellectual
property rights important for our business in such jurisdictions, the value of these rights might be diminished, and we might face additional
competition from others in those jurisdictions. 

Changes
to patent law, for example the Leahy-Smith America Invests Act, AIA or Leahy-Smith Act, of 2011 and the Patent Reform Act of 2009 and
other future article of legislation in the U.S., might substantially change the regulations and procedures surrounding patent applications,
issuance of patents, prosecution of patents, challenges to patent validity, and patent enforcement. We can give no assurance that our
patents or those of our licensor(s) can be defended or will protect us against future intellectual property challenges, particularly
as they pertain to changes in patent law and future patent law interpretations. 

In
addition, enforcing and maintaining our intellectual property protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document-submission,
fee-payment and other requirements imposed by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and courts, and foreign government patent agencies
and courts, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. 

- 37 - 

Filing,
prosecuting and defending patents covering our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive,
and our intellectual property rights in some jurisdictions outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States.
And filing, prosecuting and defending patents even in only those jurisdictions in which we develop or commercialize our product candidates
might be prohibitively expensive or impractical. Competitors might use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent
protection to develop their own products or technologies and, further, may export otherwise infringing products or technologies to territories
where we and have patent protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These third-party products
or technologies might compete with our product candidates, and our intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to
prevent third parties from competing. 

In
addition, we might decide to abandon national or regional patent applications while they are still pending or to abandon granted patents.
This might invite or encourage third parties to develop their products or technologies in jurisdictions where we abandon patent applications
or patents. 

If
we are not able to protect and control our unpatented trade secrets, know-how and other technological innovation, we might suffer competitive
harm. 

We
also rely on proprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how to protect our research and development activities, particularly when
we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or available. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We will attempt
to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how by requiring our employees, consultants, collaborators, and advisors to execute
a confidentiality and non-use agreement. We cannot guarantee that these agreements will provide meaningful protection; that these agreements
will not be breached, by, e.g., a misappropriating or disclosing our confidential information; that we will have an adequate remedy for
any such breach; or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or independently developed by a third party. Our trade secrets,
and those of our present or future collaborators that we utilize by agreement, might become known or might be independently discovered
by others, which could adversely affect the competitive position of our product candidates. 

We
might incur substantial costs prosecuting our patent applications, maintaining our patents and patent applications, enforcing our patents,
defending against third-party patent infringement suits, seeking invalidation of third-party patents or in-licensing third-party intellectual
property, as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights. 

We
might be unaware of or unfamiliar with prior art and/or interpretations of prior art that could potentially impact the validity or scope
of our patents or pending patent applications, or patent applications that we will file. We might have elected, or elect now or in the
future, not to maintain or pursue intellectual property rights that, at some point in time, might be considered relevant to or enforceable
against a competitor. 

We
take efforts and enter into agreements with employees, consultants, collaborators, and advisors to confirm ownership of and chain of
title in intellectual property rights. However, an inventorship or ownership dispute could arise that might permit one or more third
parties to practice our intellectual property rights, including possible efforts to enforce rights against us. 

We
might not have rights under some patents or patent applications that cover technologies that we use in our research, drug targets that
we select, product candidates and particular uses thereof that we seek to develop and commercialize, as well as synthesis of our product
candidates. Third parties might own or control these patents and patent applications in the United States and elsewhere. These third
parties could bring claims against us or our collaborators that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against
us, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us or our collaborators, we
or they could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the
subject of the suit. We or our collaborators therefore might choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from the third-party and
would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses might not be available on acceptable terms, or
at all. Even if we or our collaborators were able to obtain a license, the rights might be nonexclusive, which would give our competitors
access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product or product candidate, or forced
to cease some aspect of our business operations, as a result of patent infringement claims, which could harm our business. 

- 38 - 

Periodic
maintenance fees on issued U.S. patents are due to be paid to the USPTO, and periodic maintenance fees on issued non-U.S. patents and
pending non-U.S. patent applications are due to be paid to non-U.S. patent offices. The patent offices require compliance with many procedural,
documentary, fee payment and other requirements during the patent application process and after a patent issues or grants. While an inadvertent
lapse can in some cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations
in which non-compliance, for example, caused by geopolitical events such as civil or political unrest (including the ongoing conflict
between Ukraine and Russia), can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete
loss of a patent or patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a
patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to patent office actions within prescribed time limits,
non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. In such an event, our competitors might be able to
enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. 

The
USPTO and various non-U.S. government agencies require compliance with certain foreign filing requirements during the patent application
process. For example, in some countries, including the United States, a foreign filing license is required before certain patent applications
are filed outside that country. The foreign filing license requirements can vary by country. In some cases, a foreign filing license
may be obtained retroactively in accordance with the applicable rules. There are situations, however, in which non-compliance can result
in abandonment of a pending patent application or can be grounds for revoking or invalidating an issued patent, resulting in the loss
of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, potential competitors might be able to enter the relevant markets with
similar or identical products or technology, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations, and prospects. 

There
has been substantial litigation and other legal proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical
and biotechnology industries. Although we are not currently a party to any patent litigation or any other adversarial proceeding, including
any interference or derivation proceeding declared or instituted before the United States Patent and Trademark Office, regarding intellectual
property rights with respect to our intended products, our product candidates and our technology, it is possible that we might become
one in the future. We are not currently aware of any actual or reasonably foreseeable third-party infringement claim involving our product
candidates. The cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. The outcome
of patent litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance, including the dispute forum, demeanor
and credibility of witnesses and the identity of the adverse party, especially in pharmaceutical and biotechnology related patent cases
that might turn on the testimony of experts as to technical facts upon which experts might reasonably disagree. Some of our competitors
might be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater
financial resources. If a patent or other proceeding is resolved against us, we might be enjoined from researching, developing, manufacturing
or commercializing our intended products or our product candidates without a license from the other party and we might be held liable
for significant damages. We might not be able to obtain any required license on commercially acceptable terms or at all. 

Uncertainties
resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace.
Patent litigation or other proceedings might also absorb significant management time. 

If
we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitors might develop and market products with similar or identical
features that might reduce demand for our potential products. 

The
following factors are important to our success: 

receiving patent
 protection for our product candidates; 

preventing others from
 infringing our intellectual property rights; and 

maintaining our patent
 rights and trade secrets. 

- 39 - 

We
will be able to protect our intellectual property rights in patents and trade secrets from unauthorized use by third parties only to
the extent that such intellectual property rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade
secrets and we enforce these rights. 

Because
issues of patentability involve complex legal and factual questions, the issuance, scope or enforceability of patents cannot be predicted
with certainty. Patents can be challenged, invalidated, found unenforceable, or circumvented. United States patents and patent applications
can be subject to interference or derivation proceedings. United States patents can also be subject to post grant proceedings, including
re-examination, derivation, Inter Partes Review and Post Grant Review, in the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Foreign
patents can be subject to opposition or comparable proceedings in corresponding foreign patent offices. Any of these challenges might
result in loss of the patent, rejection of the patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the
patent or patent application. In addition, these proceedings can be costly. Thus, any patents that we own or license from others might
not provide any protection against competitors. Furthermore, an adverse decision in an interference or derivation proceeding can result
in a third-party receiving the patent rights sought by us, which in turn could affect our ability to market a potential product to which
that patent filing was directed. Our pending patent applications, those that we might file in the future, or those that we might license
from third parties might not result in patents being issued. If issued, they might not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive
advantages against competitors with similar or identical technology. Furthermore, others might independently develop similar technologies
or duplicate any technology that we have developed. Some countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner might be
compelled to grant licenses to third parties. For example, compulsory licenses might be required in cases such as where the patent owner
has failed to work the invention in that country or where a third-party has patented improvements. In addition, some countries
might limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, we might have limited
infringement remedies, which could materially diminish the value of our patents. Moreover, the legal systems of some countries are less
supportive of enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, than the United States, which might make
it difficult to stop infringement in these countries. 

In
addition, our ability to enforce our patent rights depends on our ability to detect infringement. It is difficult to detect infringers
who do not advertise or otherwise promote the compounds that are used in their products. Any litigation to enforce or defend our patent
rights, even if we prevail, could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of management and key personnel from business
operations. 

We
will also rely on trade secrets, know-how and technology, which are not protected by patents, to maintain our competitive position. We
will seek to protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements with parties that have access to it, such as strategic
partners, collaborators, employees, contractors and consultants. Any of these parties might breach these agreements and misappropriate
or disclose our confidential information or our competitors might learn of the information in some other way. If any trade secret, know-how
or other technology not protected by a patent were disclosed to, or independently developed by, a competitor, our business, financial
condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 

Risks
Related to Commercialization of Our Current Product Candidate and Future Product Candidates 

Our
commercial success depends upon attaining significant market acceptance of our current product candidate and future product candidates,
if approved, among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and cancer treatment centers. 

Even
if we obtain regulatory approval for our lead product candidate or any future product candidates, the products might not gain market
acceptance among physicians, healthcare payors, patients or the medical community, including cancer treatment centers. Market acceptance
of any product candidates for which we receive approval depends on a number of factors, including: 

the efficacy
 and safety of such product candidates as demonstrated in clinical trials; 

- 40 - 

the clinical
 indications and patient populations for which the product candidate is approved; 

acceptance by physicians,
 major cancer treatment centers and patients of the drug as a safe and effective treatment; 

the adoption of novel immunotherapies
 by physicians, hospitals and third-party payors; 

the potential and perceived
 advantages of product candidates over alternative treatments; 

the safety of product candidates
 seen in a broader patient group, including our use outside the approved indications; 

any restrictions on use
 together with other medications; 

the prevalence and severity
 of any side effects; 

product labeling or product
 insert requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities; 

the timing of market introduction
 of our intended product as well as competitive products; 

the development of manufacturing
 and distribution processes for commercial scale manufacturing for our lead product candidate and any future product candidates; 

the cost of treatment in
 relation to alternative treatments; 

the availability of coverage
 and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors and government authorities; 

relative convenience and
 ease of administration; and 

the effectiveness of our
 sales and marketing efforts and those of our collaborators. 

If
our lead product candidate and any future product candidates are approved but fail to achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients,
healthcare payors or cancer treatment centers, we will not be able to generate significant revenues, which would compromise our ability
to become profitable. 

Even
if we are able to commercialize our lead product candidate or any future product candidates, the products might not receive coverage
or adequate reimbursement from third-party payors in the United States and in other countries in which we seek to commercialize our intended
products, which could harm our business. 

Our
ability to commercialize any product successfully will depend, in part, on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for
such product and related treatments will be available from third-party payors, including government health administration authorities,
private health insurers and other organizations. 

Third-party
payors determine which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the healthcare industry is
cost containment. Third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular
medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices
and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Third-party payors might also seek additional clinical evidence, beyond
the data required to obtain regulatory approval, demonstrating clinical benefit and value in specific patient populations before covering
our intended product for those patients. We cannot be sure that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be available for any product
that we commercialize and, if coverage is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage and reimbursement might impact
the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain regulatory approval. If reimbursement is not available or
is available only at limited levels, we might not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain regulatory
approval. 

- 41 - 

There
might be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage might be more limited than
the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage
and reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research,
development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, might also not be sufficient
to cover our costs and might only be temporary. Reimbursement rates might vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting
in which it is used, might be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and might be incorporated into existing
payments for other services. Net prices for drugs might be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by third-party payors and
by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they might be sold at lower prices than
in the United States. No uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can
differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party payors can rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting
their own reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. Our inability
to promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved product
that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, ability to raise capital needed to commercialize our intended
product and overall financial condition. 

Healthcare
legislative measures aimed at reducing healthcare costs might have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

Third-party
payors, whether domestic or foreign, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling
healthcare costs. In both the United States and certain international jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory
changes to the health care system that could impact our ability to sell our intended product profitably. In particular, in 2010, the
Affordable Care Act ACA was enacted, which, among other things, subjected biologic products to potential competition
by lower-cost biosimilars, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program
are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by
most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions
of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded
prescription drugs, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government s comparative effectiveness research. 

There
have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal and state levels directed at
containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. We cannot predict the initiatives that might be adopted in the future. The continuing
efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce
costs of healthcare and/or impose price controls might adversely affect: 

the demand
 for our lead product candidate, if we obtain regulatory approval; 

our ability
 to receive or set a price that we believe is fair for our intended product; 

our ability to generate
 revenue and achieve or maintain profitability; 

the level of taxes that
 we are required to pay; and 

the availability of capital. 

We
expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that might be adopted in the future, might result in additional reductions
in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, lower reimbursement and new payment methodologies. This could
lower the price that we receive for any approved product. Any denial in coverage or reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other
government-funded programs might result in a similar denial or reduction in payments from private payors, which might prevent us from
being able to generate sufficient revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidate, if approved. 

- 42 - 

Price
controls might be imposed in foreign markets, which might adversely affect our future profitability. 

In
some countries, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental
authorities can take considerable time after receipt of regulatory approval for a product. In addition, there can be considerable pressure
by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political,
economic and regulatory developments might further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations might continue after reimbursement
has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced
and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. 

In
some countries, we or our collaborators might be required to conduct a clinical trial or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness
of our product candidate to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. Publication of
discounts by third-party payors or authorities might lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country
of publication and other countries. If reimbursement of our intended product is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing
is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be adversely affected. 

Risks
Related to Healthcare Compliance Regulations 

Our
relationships with customers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare
laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished
profits and future earnings. If we or they are unable to comply with these provisions, we might become subject to civil and criminal
investigations and proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects. 

Healthcare
providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates
for which we obtain regulatory approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, healthcare entities, third-party
payors and customers might expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that might constrain
the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, develop and will market, sell and distribute our
intended product. As a pharmaceutical company, even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly
to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and
patients rights are applicable to our business. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations
that might affect our ability to operate include the following: 

the federal
 healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute which prohibits, among other things, individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting,
 offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward,
 or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for
 which payment might be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; 

federal civil
 and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act that can be enforced through civil whistleblower or qui tam
 actions, and civil monetary penalty laws, prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented,
 to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent
 or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 

the federal Health Insurance
 Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 HIPAA which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme
 to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also created federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying,
 concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment
 for healthcare benefits, items or services, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act
 of 2009 HITECH which imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the
 privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on entities subject to the law, such as certain
 healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, and their respective business associates
 that perform services for them that involve the creation, use, maintenance or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information; 

- 43 - 

the federal physician sunshine
 requirements under the ACA which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies, with certain exceptions,
 to report annually to HHS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers,
 and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate
 family members and applicable group purchasing organizations; 

analogous state and foreign
 laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which might apply to sales or marketing arrangements and
 claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; some
 state laws which require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry s voluntary compliance guidelines
 and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and might require drug manufacturers to report information
 related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures or pricing
 information; and certain state and local laws which require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and 

state and foreign laws
 govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant
 ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

Efforts
to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve
substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices might not comply with current
or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations
are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that might apply to us, we might be subject to
significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from government funded
healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, and the curtailment or restructuring
of our operations. If any physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to not be
in compliance with applicable laws, they might be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government
funded healthcare programs. 

Our
employees might engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements,
which could cause significant liability for us and harm our reputation. 

We
are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct, including intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or similar
regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities, provide accurate information to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities,
comply with manufacturing standards we have established, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations
and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities, report financial information
or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information
obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always
possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity might not be effective
in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits
stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are
not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results
of operations, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion
from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and integrity oversight and reporting obligations. 

- 44 - 

Product
liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we
might develop. 

We
face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our lead product candidate or future product candidates
in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products that we might develop. Product liability
claims might be brought against us by subjects enrolled in our clinical trials, patients, healthcare providers or others using, administering
or selling our intended product. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our lead product candidate or product
caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims might result in: 

decreased demand
 for any product candidates or products that we might develop; 

termination of clinical
 trial sites or entire clinical trial programs; 

injury to our reputation
 and significant negative media attention; 

withdrawal of clinical
 trial participants; 

significant costs to defend
 the related litigation; 

substantial monetary awards
 to trial subjects or patients; 

loss of revenue; 

diversion of management
 and scientific resources from our business operations; and 

the inability to commercialize
 any products that we might develop. 

Prior
to engaging in future clinical trials, we intend to obtain product liability insurance coverage at a level that we believe is customary
for similarly situated companies and adequate to provide us with insurance coverage for foreseeable risks; however, we might be unable
to obtain such coverage at a reasonable cost, if at all. If we are able to obtain product liability insurance, we might not be able to
maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that might arise and such insurance
might not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we might incur. Furthermore, we intend to expand our insurance coverage for products
to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain regulatory approval for our lead product candidate in development, but we might
be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products that receive regulatory approval. Large judgments
have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or
series of claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect
our business. 

Risks
Related to our Business Operations 

We
face substantial competition, which might result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully
than we do. 

We
will face competition from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, as well as from academic institutions, government agencies
and private and public research institutions for our lead product candidate. Our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated
if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than
any products that we might develop. Competition could result in reduced sales and pricing pressure on our lead product candidate, if
approved, which in turn would reduce our ability to generate meaningful revenues and have a negative impact on our results of operations.
In addition, significant delays in the development of our lead product candidate could allow our competitors to bring products to market
before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our lead product candidate. The biotechnology industry, including the cancer immunotherapy
market, is intensely competitive and involves a high degree of risk. We compete with other companies that have far greater experience
and financial, research and technical resources than us. Potential competitors in the United States and worldwide are numerous and include
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, educational institutions and research foundations, many of which have substantially greater
capital resources, marketing experience, research and development staffs and facilities than ours. Some of our competitors might develop
and commercialize products that compete directly with those incorporating our technology or might introduce products to market earlier
than our intended product or on a more cost-effective basis. Our competitors compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific
and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our technology. We might face competition with respect
to product efficacy and safety, ease of use and adaptability to various modes of administration, acceptance by physicians, the timing
and scope of regulatory approvals, availability of resources, reimbursement coverage, price and patent position, including the potentially
dominant patent positions of others. An inability to successfully complete our product development or commercializing our lead product
candidate could result in our having limited prospects for establishing market share or generating revenue. 

- 45 - 

Many
of our competitors or potential competitors have significantly greater established presence in the market, financial resources and expertise
in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing
approved products than we do, and as a result might have a competitive advantage over us. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical
and biotechnology industries might result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller
or early-stage companies might also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and
established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel,
establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies and technology licenses
complementary to our programs or potentially advantageous to our business. 

As
a result of these factors, these competitors might obtain regulatory approval of their products before we are able to obtain patent protection
or other intellectual property rights, which will limit our ability to develop or commercialize our lead product candidate. Our competitors
might also develop drugs that are safer, more effective, more widely used and cheaper than ours, and might also be more successful than
us in manufacturing and marketing their products. These appreciable advantages could render our lead product candidate obsolete or non-competitive
before we can recover the expenses of development and commercialization. 

Our
business might be adversely affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. 

The
outbreak of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has evolved into a global pandemic. The coronavirus has spread to many regions of the
world. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our business and operating results will depend on future developments that are highly
uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that might emerge concerning the coronavirus and the actions
to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others. 

As
a result of the continuing spread of the coronavirus and emergence of new variants, our business operations could be delayed or interrupted.
For instance, our clinical trials might be affected by the pandemic. Site initiation, participant recruitment and enrollment, participant
dosing, distribution of clinical trial materials, study monitoring and data analysis might be paused or delayed due to changes in hospital
or university policies, federal, state or local regulations, prioritization of hospital resources toward pandemic efforts, or other reasons
related to the pandemic. If the coronavirus continues to spread, some participants and clinical investigators might not be able to comply
with clinical trial protocols. For example, quarantines or other travel limitations (whether voluntary or required) might impede participant
movement, affect sponsor access to study sites, or interrupt healthcare services, and we might be unable to conduct our clinical trials.
Further, if the spread of the coronavirus pandemic continues and our operations are adversely impacted, we risk a delay, default and/or
non-performance under existing agreements which might increase our costs. These cost increases might not be fully recoverable or adequately
covered by insurance. 

Infections
and deaths related to the pandemic might disrupt the United States healthcare and healthcare regulatory systems. Such disruptions could
divert healthcare resources away from, or materially delay FDA review and/or approval with respect to, our clinical trials. It is unknown
how long these disruptions could continue, were they to occur. Any elongation or de-prioritization of our clinical trials or delay in
regulatory review resulting from such disruptions could materially affect the development and study of our product candidates. 

- 46 - 

We
currently utilize third parties to, among other things, manufacture raw materials. If either any third-party parties in the supply chain
for materials used in the production of our product candidates are adversely impacted by restrictions resulting from the coronavirus
outbreak, our supply chain might be disrupted, limiting our ability to manufacture our product candidates for our clinical trials and
research and development operations. 

As
a result of the shelter-in-place order and other mandated local travel restrictions, our employees conducting research and development
or manufacturing activities might not be able to access their laboratory or manufacturing space which might result in our core activities
being significantly limited or curtailed, possibly for an extended period of time. 

The
spread of the coronavirus, which has caused a broad impact globally, including travel restrictions and quarantine policies put into place
by businesses and governments, might have a material adverse effect on our business. While the potential economic impact brought by and
the duration of the pandemic might be difficult to assess or predict, it has already caused, and is likely to result in further, significant
disruption of global financial markets, which might reduce our ability to access capital either at all or on favorable terms. In addition,
a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the spread of the coronavirus could materially and adversely
affect our business and the value of our common stock. 

The
ultimate impact of the current pandemic, or any other health epidemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know
the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our clinical trials, our research programs, healthcare systems or the
global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor the
situation closely. 

Significant
disruptions of information technology systems, computer system failures or breaches of information security could adversely affect our
business. 

We
rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business,
we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information (including, but not limited to, personal information and intellectual
property). The size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems, and those of our third-party vendors
with whom we might contract, make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent
or intentional actions by our employees or vendors, or from malicious attacks by third parties. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels
of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage
and market manipulation) and expertise. While we intend to invest in the protection of data and information technology, there can be
no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches. 

Our
internal computer systems, and those of our CROs, our CMOs, and other business vendors on which we might rely, are vulnerable to damage
from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, fire, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. We
exercise little or no control over these third parties, which increases our vulnerability to problems with their systems. If such an
event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs.
Any interruption or breach in our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive
confidential information or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us or allow
third parties to gain material, inside information that they use to trade in our securities. For example, the loss of clinical trial
data from completed or ongoing clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our
costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data
or applications, or misappropriation or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability, the further
development of our lead and future product candidates could be delayed and our business could be otherwise adversely affected. 

- 47 - 

We
might need to grow the size of our organization in the future, and we might experience difficulties in managing this growth. 

As
of March 1, 2023, we had three full-time officer/employees and one part-time officer/employee. The Company relies to a significant extent
on outside consultants and advisors with various technical skills and expertise that the Company can draw on as necessary to conduct
its research and development and clinical trial programs. We might need to grow the size of our organization in order to support our
continued development and potential commercialization of our lead product candidate. As our development and commercialization plans and
strategies continue to develop, our need for additional managerial, operational, manufacturing, sales, marketing, financial and other
resources might increase. Our management, personnel and systems currently in place might not be adequate to support this future growth.
Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including: 

managing our
 clinical trials effectively; 

identifying, recruiting,
 maintaining, motivating and integrating additional employees; 

managing our internal development
 efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to licensors, licensees, contractors and other third parties; 

improving our managerial,
 development, operational, information technology, and finance systems; and 

expanding our facilities. 

If
our operations expand, we will likely also need to manage additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers and other
third parties. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our lead product candidate and to compete effectively
will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively, as well as our ability to develop a sales and marketing
force when appropriate for our company. To that end, we must be able to manage our development efforts and preclinical studies and clinical
trials effectively and hire, train and integrate additional management, research and development, manufacturing, administrative and sales
and marketing personnel. The failure to accomplish any of these tasks could prevent us from successfully growing our company. 

Inadequate
funding for the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel,
prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from
performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business might rely, which could negatively impact our business. 

The
ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding
levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes.
Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other
government agencies on which our operations might rely, including those that fund research and development activities is subject to the
political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. 

Disruptions
at the FDA and other agencies might also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government
agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, including beginning on December 22, 2018,
the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, have had to furlough critical
FDA, SEC and other government employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly
impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on
our business. Further, in our operations as a public company, future government shutdowns could impact our ability to access the public
markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations.

Unstable
market and economic conditions and adverse developments with respect to financial institutions and associated liquidity risk may have
serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and stock price. 

The
global credit and financial markets have recently experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity
and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, inflationary pressures and interest rate changes,
increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. The financial markets and the global economy may also be adversely
affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, terrorism or other
geopolitical events. Sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries in response to such conflicts, including the one in Ukraine,
may also adversely impact the financial markets and the global economy, and any economic countermeasures by the affected countries or
others could exacerbate market and economic instability. More recently, the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and their
placement into receivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) created bank-specific and broader financial institution
liquidity risk and concerns. Although the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC jointly released a statement
that depositors at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank would have access to their funds, even those in excess of the standard FDIC
insurance limits, under a systemic risk exception, future adverse developments with respect to specific financial institutions or the
broader financial services industry may lead to market-wide liquidity shortages, impair the ability of companies to access near-term
working capital needs, and create additional market and economic uncertainty. There can be no assurance that future credit and financial
market instability and a deterioration in confidence in economic conditions will not occur. Our general business strategy may be adversely
affected by any such economic downturn, liquidity shortages, volatile business environment or continued unpredictable and unstable market
conditions. If the equity markets deteriorate, or if adverse developments are experienced by financial institutions, it may cause short-term
liquidity risk and also make any necessary equity financing more difficult, more costly and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary
financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business plans and stock price and could
require us to delay or abandon clinical development plans. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our current service providers,
financial institutions, manufacturers and other partners may be adversely affected by the foregoing risks, which could directly affect
our ability to conduct our business plans on schedule and on budget. 

Risks
Related to Owning our Securities 

We
are a smaller reporting company and we have elected to comply with certain reduced reporting and disclosure requirements
which could make its common stock less attractive to investors. 

We
are a smaller reporting company, as defined in the Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities
Act ), which allows us to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other
public companies that are not smaller reporting companies, including (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements
of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and (2) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic
reports and proxy statements. In addition, as an emerging growth company, we are only required to provide two years of audited financial
statements in this document. As a result of these reduced reporting and disclosure requirements our financial statements might not be
comparable to SEC registrants not classified as emerging growth companies. 

We
cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we might rely on these exemptions. If some investors find
our common stock less attractive as a result, there might be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price might
be more volatile. 

Our
independent registered public accounting firm is not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting until we are no longer a smaller reporting company . We cannot assure you that there will not be material
weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls in the future. 

Investors
might find our common stock less attractive as a result of our election to utilize these exemptions, which could result in a less active
trading market for our common stock and/or the market price of our common stock might be more volatile. 

- 49 - 

The
Warrants are speculative in nature. 

The
Warrants offered in our November 2020 public offering do not confer any rights of common stock ownership on their holders, such as voting
rights or the right to receive dividends, but rather merely represent the right to acquire shares of common stock at a fixed price. Specifically,
holders of the Warrants may exercise their right to acquire the common stock and pay an exercise price of 5.70 per share. Furthermore,
each Warrant will expire five (5) years from the original issuance date. In the event our common stock price does not exceed the exercise
price of the Warrants during the period when the Warrants are exercisable, the Warrants might not have any value. 

Holders
of the Warrants will have no rights as a common stockholder until they acquire our common stock. 

Until
the acquisition of shares of our common stock upon exercise of the Warrants, a holder will have no rights with respect to shares of our
common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrant. Upon exercise of a Warrant, a holder will be entitled to exercise the rights of a
common stockholder as to the security exercised only as to matters for which the record date occurs after the exercise. 

There
is a limited market for the Warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. 

Although
the Warrants are currently trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market, there can be no assurance that there will be an active trading market
for the Warrants. Without an active trading market, the liquidity of the Warrants will be limited. 

Provisions
of the Warrants could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party. 

Certain
provisions of the Warrants could make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire us. The Warrants prohibit us from engaging
in certain transactions constituting fundamental transactions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes
our obligations under the Warrants. These and other provisions of the Warrants could prevent or deter a third party from acquiring us
even where the acquisition could be beneficial to you. 

The
price of our common stock or Warrants might fluctuate substantially. 

You
should consider an investment in our common stock and Warrants to be risky. Some factors that might cause the market price of our common
stock or Warrants to fluctuate, in addition to the other risks mentioned in this Risk Factors , are: 

sale of our
 common stock by our stockholders, executives, and directors and our stockholders; 

volatility and limitations
 in trading volumes of our shares of common stock; 

our ability to obtain financings
 to conduct and complete research and development activities including, but not limited to, our clinical trials, and other business
 activities; 

the timing
 and success of introductions of new products by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry,
 including consolidation among competitors, customers or strategic partners; 

network outages or security
 breaches; 

our ability to secure resources
 and the necessary personnel to conduct clinical trials on our desired schedule; 

commencement, enrollment
 or results of our clinical trials for our lead product candidate or any future clinical trials we might conduct; 

changes in the development
 status of our lead product candidate; 

- 50 - 

any delays or adverse developments
 or perceived adverse developments with respect to the FDA s review of our planned preclinical and clinical trials; 

any delay in our submission
 for studies or product approvals or adverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval for our lead product
 candidate; 

unanticipated safety concerns
 related to the use of our lead product candidate; 

failures to meet external
 expectations or management guidance; 

changes in our capital
 structure or dividend policy, future issuances of securities, sales of large blocks of common stock by our stockholders; 

our cash position; 

announcements and events
 surrounding financing efforts, including debt and equity securities; 

our inability to enter
 into new markets or develop new products; 

reputational issues; 

competition from existing
 technologies and products or new technologies and products that might emerge; 

announcements of acquisitions,
 partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, new products, capital commitments, or other events by us or our competitors; 

changes in
 general economic, political and market conditions in or any of the regions in which we conduct our business; 

changes in industry conditions
 or perceptions; 

changes in valuations of
 similar companies or groups of companies; 

analyst research reports,
 recommendation and changes in recommendations, price targets, and withdrawals of coverage; 

departures and additions
 of key personnel; 

disputes and litigations
 related to intellectual properties, proprietary rights, and contractual obligations; 

changes in applicable laws,
 rules, regulations, or accounting practices and other dynamics; and 

other events or factors,
 many of which might be out of our control. 

In
addition, if the market for stocks in our industry or industries related to our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences
a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition
and results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and might expose us to lawsuits that,
even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.

Risks
Related to the Company s Common Stock 

The
Company received a written notice from Nasdaq that it has failed to comply with certain listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market,
which could result in the Company being delisted from The Nasdaq Stock Market. 

On
June 24, 2022, the Company received an initial notification from Nasdaq related to its failure to maintain a minimum bid price of 1.00
per share for a period of 30 consecutive business days. The Nasdaq Listing Rules provided the Company a compliance period of 180 calendar
days in which to regain compliance, which in the case of the initial notification was December 21, 2022. As the Company did not regain
compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, the Company was afforded a second 180 calendar day compliance period to regain compliance
by letter dated December 22, 2022. If at any time from the date of this second notice until June 19, 2023, the closing bid price of the
Company s common stock is at least 1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide the Company
with written confirmation of compliance and the matter will be closed. If the Company does not regain compliance with the minimum bid
price requirement by the end of the second compliance period, the Company s common stock and warrants will become subject to delisting. 

In
order to achieve compliance with the minimum closing bid price per share requirement, the Company intends to file a proxy statement to
hold a special meeting of stockholders to seek approval to effect a reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of common
stock. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in this regard and will be able to regain compliance with
the minimum closing bid price requirement by June 19, 2023, in which case the Company anticipates Nasdaq would provide a notice to the
Company that its shares of common stock and warrants are subject to delisting, and the Company s common shares and warrants would
then be delisted. 

Further,
there can be no assurance that the market price per new share of the Company s common stock after the reverse stock split will
remain unchanged or increase in proportion to the reduction in the number of old shares of the Company s common stock outstanding
before the reverse stock split. Even if the reverse stock split is approved by the Company s stockholders, there can be no assurance
that the Company will be able to maintain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement in the future or will otherwise be able to
maintain compliance with other Nasdaq listing rules. 

If
the Company is delisted from Nasdaq, its common stock and warrants may be eligible for trading on an over-the-counter market. If the
Company is not able to obtain a listing on another stock exchange or quotation service for its common stock and warrants, it may be extremely
difficult or impossible for stockholders to sell their shares of common stock and warrants. Moreover, if the Company is delisted from
Nasdaq, but obtains a substitute listing for its common stock and warrants, it will likely be on a market with less liquidity, and therefore
experience potentially more price volatility than experienced on Nasdaq. Stockholders may not be able to sell their shares of common
stock and warrants on any such substitute market in the quantities, at the times, or at the prices that could potentially be available
on a more liquid trading market. As a result of these factors, if the Company s common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, the value
and liquidity of the Company s common stock and warrants would likely be significantly adversely affected. A delisting of the Company s
common stock from Nasdaq could also adversely affect the Company s ability to obtain financing for its operations and/or could
result in a loss of confidence by investors, employees and/or business partners. 

If
the Company implements a reverse stock split, liquidity of its common stock may be adversely effected. 

As
indicated above, the Company intends to seek approval from its stockholders to effect a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding
shares of its common stock in order to regain compliance with the Nasdaq 1.00 minimum bid price requirement. The liquidity of the shares
of the Company s common stock may be affected adversely by any reverse stock split given the reduced number of shares of the Company s
common stock that will be outstanding following the reverse stock split, particularly if the market price of the Company s common
stock does not increase as a result of the reverse stock split. 

Following
any reverse stock split, the resulting market price of the Company s common stock may not attract new investors and may not satisfy
the investing requirements of those investors. Although the Company believes that a higher market price of the Company s common
stock may help generate greater or broader investor interest, there can be no assurance that the reverse stock split will result in a
share price that will attract new investors, including institutional investors. In addition, there can be no assurance that the market
price of the Company s common stock will satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. As a result, the trading liquidity
of the Company s common stock may not necessarily improve, or could decrease. 

- 52 - 

A
sale or perceived sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock might cause the price of our common stock to decline. 

If
our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could fall.
Moreover, the perceived risk of this potential dilution could cause stockholders to attempt to sell their shares and investors to short
our common stock. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a
time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate. 

Market
and economic conditions might negatively impact our business, financial condition and share price. 

Concerns
over medical epidemics, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the U.S. mortgage market and a deteriorating real estate market, unstable
global credit markets and financial conditions, and volatile oil prices have led to periods of significant economic instability, diminished
liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence and discretionary spending, diminished expectations for the global
economy and expectations of slower global economic growth, increased unemployment rates, and increased credit defaults in recent years.
Our general business strategy might be adversely affected by any such economic downturns (including the impact related to the recent
COVID-19 pandemic), volatile business environments and continued unstable or unpredictable economic and market conditions. If these conditions
continue to deteriorate or do not improve, it might make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to complete, more costly,
and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse
effect on our growth strategy, financial performance, and share price and could require us to delay or abandon development or commercialization
plans. 

If
securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports, or publish unfavorable research or reports about our business, our
stock price and trading volume might decline. 

The
trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us,
our business, our markets and our competitors. We do not control these analysts. If securities analysts do not cover our common stock,
the lack of research coverage might adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts
who do cover us downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary about us or our business, our stock price
would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose
visibility in the market and interest in our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline
and might also impair our ability to expand our business with existing customers and attract new customers. 

Future
sales and issuances of our common stock could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could
cause our share price to fall. 

We
expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations, including increased marketing,
hiring new personnel, commercializing our intended product, and continuing activities as an operating public company. To the extent we
raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders might experience substantial dilution. We might sell common stock,
convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time.
If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors might be materially
diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales might also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could
gain rights superior to our existing stockholders. 

We
do not intend to pay cash dividends on our shares of common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our shares. 

We
currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate
declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the increase,
if any, of our share price. 

- 53 - 

We
might be at risk of securities class action litigation. 

We
might be at risk of securities class action litigation. In the past, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant
stock price volatility, particularly when associated with binary events such as clinical trials and product approvals. If we face such
litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources, which could harm our
business and results in a decline in the market price of our common stock. 

Our
Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws, and Delaware law might have anti-takeover effects that could discourage,
delay or prevent a change in control, which might cause our stock price to decline. 

Our
Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws, and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to
acquire us, even if closing such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders. We are authorized to issue up to 10,000,000 shares
of preferred stock. This preferred stock might be issued in one or more series, the terms of which might be determined at the time of
issuance by our Board of Directors without further action by stockholders. The terms of any series of preferred stock might include voting
rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as to dividend, liquidation, conversion and redemption
rights and sinking fund provisions. We have designated 350,000 shares of preferred stock as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, all
of which are issued and outstanding. The issuance of any preferred stock could materially adversely affect the rights of the holders
of our common stock, and therefore, reduce the value of our common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of
preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell our assets to, a third party and thereby preserve control
by the present management. 

Provisions
of our Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws and Delaware law also could have the effect of discouraging potential
acquisition proposals or making a tender offer or delaying or preventing a change in control, including changes a stockholder might consider
favorable. Such provisions might also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. In particular,
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law, as applicable, among other things: 

provide the
 Board of Directors with the ability to alter the bylaws without stockholder approval; 

place limitations on the
 removal of directors; 

establishing advance notice
 requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder
 meetings; and 

provide that vacancies
 on the Board of Directors might be filled by a majority of directors in office, although less than a quorum. 

Financial
reporting obligations of being a public company in the United States are expensive and time-consuming, and our management will be required
to devote substantial time to compliance matters. 

As
a publicly traded company we incur significant additional legal, accounting and other expenses. The obligations of being a public company
in the United States require significant expenditures and will place significant demands on our management and other personnel, including
costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations regarding corporate governance
practices, including those under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the listing
requirements of the stock exchange on which our securities are listed. These rules require the establishment and maintenance of effective
disclosure and financial controls and procedures, internal control over financial reporting and changes in corporate governance practices,
among many other complex rules that are often difficult to implement, monitor and maintain compliance with. Moreover, despite recent
reforms made possible by the JOBS Act, the reporting requirements, rules, and regulations will make some activities more time-consuming
and costly, particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company . In addition, we expect these rules and regulations
to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. Our management and other personnel
will need to devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of these requirements and to keep pace with new regulations,
otherwise we might fall out of compliance and risk becoming subject to litigation or being delisted, among other potential problems. 

- 54 - 

If
we fail to comply with the rules under Sarbanes-Oxley related to accounting controls and procedures in the future, or, if we discover
material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly
and raising capital could be more difficult. 

Section
404 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If
we fail to comply with the rules under Sarbanes-Oxley related to disclosure controls and procedures in the future, or, if we discover
material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly
and raising capital could be more difficult. If material weaknesses or significant deficiencies are discovered or if we otherwise fail
to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control, we might not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis
that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley. Moreover, effective
internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. If
we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose
confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly.

Effective
November 25, 2020, the Company s common stock and Warrants began to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols LIXT 
and LIXTW , respectively. Prior to November 30, 2020, the Company s common stock traded on the OTCQB. The stock market
in general has experienced extreme stock price fluctuations in the past few years. In some cases, these fluctuations have been unrelated
to the operating performance of the affected companies. Many companies have experienced dramatic volatility in the market prices of their
common stock. The Company believes that a number of factors, both within and outside its control, could cause the price of the Company s
common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially.

You
should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with and our consolidated
financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information,
this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results
may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited
to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K. 

Overview 

The
Company is a drug discovery company that uses biomarker technology to identify enzyme targets associated with serious common diseases
and then designs novel compounds to attack those targets. The Company s corporate office is located in Pasadena, California. 

The
Company s product pipeline is primarily focused on inhibitors of protein phosphatases, used alone and in combination with cytotoxic
agents and/or x-ray and immune checkpoint blockers. The Company believes that inhibitors of protein phosphatases have broad therapeutic
potential not only for cancer but also for other debilitating and life-threatening diseases. The Company is directing its efforts on
clinical development of a specific protein phosphatase inhibitor, referred to as LB-100, which has been shown to have clinical anti-cancer
activity at doses that produce little or no toxicity. 

The
Company s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including the need for additional capital. The Company
has not yet commenced any revenue-generating operations, does not have positive cash flows from operations, relies on stock-based compensation
for a substantial portion of employee and consultant compensation, and is dependent on periodic infusions of equity capital to fund its
operating requirements.

Recent
Developments 

The
following is a summary of news releases issued by the Company subsequent to December 31, 2022: 

Summary
of February 7, 2023 News Release 

The
Company announced that a team of scientists headed by Professor Ren Bernards at the Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam,
and member of the Board of Directors of the Company, reported that in three difficult to treat cancer types, the Company s lead
clinical compound, LB-100, combined with an inhibitor of the WEE1 kinase, caused unexpectedly effective cancer cell killing. Most surprisingly,
when cancer cells acquire resistance to this combination therapy, they have highly reduced cancer-causing capacity in animal models.
This observation indicates that this LB-100 combination therapy can force cells to give up their cancer-causing properties to acquire
drug resistance. 

John
S. Kovach, M.D., Chief Executive Officer and Founder of the Company, was a co-author of the report (see BioRxiv (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.06.527335v1)
entitled Paradoxical activation of oncogenic signaling as a cancer treatment strategy . 

The
following are comments by Dr. Kovach that were included in the news release: 

Over
the past 20 years, efforts to develop better cancer therapies have focused on inhibiting the stimulatory effects of the oncogenes, but
such therapies often deliver only modest benefit to patients with advanced cancer due to development of resistance. Dr. Matheus Henrique
Dias, working in the laboratory of Professor Ren Bernards at the Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, and an international
team of collaborators, have now shown that treatment of cancer cells with the Company s unique lead clinical compound, LB-100,
rather than inhibiting, further stimulates the signals that drive cancer cell proliferation, but paradoxically, impeding cell proliferation. 

The
authors also show that combination of LB-100 with an inhibitor of WEE1, a regulator of stress responses in the cell, leads to highly
efficient cancer cell death in three hard-to-treat cancer models: colorectal, pancreatic, and bile duct carcinomas. The Bernards 
group contends that this paradoxical result stems from the fact that the survival of cancer cells depends on a balance between activated
oncogenic pathways driving tumorigenesis and engagement of stress-response programs that counteract the inherent toxicity of such aberrant
signaling. Normal cells, which are not in proliferation overdrive in the first place, apparently can tolerate transient overstimulating
signaling much better than cancer cells. The combination of LB-100 and WEE1 inhibition suppressed the growth of patient-derived tumors
refractory to conventional therapies and was associated with only modest toxicity in animal models. 

Intriguingly,
the authors present evidence to indicate that cancer cells that become resistant to this LB-100 combination therapy do so by losing some
important cancer cell characteristics and are less cancerous in animal models. This tumor suppressive drug resistance still
needs to be demonstrated in patients. However, given the safety profile in animal models of LB-100 in combination with WEE1 inhibition,
this hypothesis should be readily testable in the clinic. 

Summary
of February 14, 2023 News Release 

The
Company announced that, as recently reported in The Journal of Clinical Investigation, PP2A, the pharmacologic target of the Company s
lead clinical compound, LB-100, when deficient, enhances the effects of immune checkpoint blockade of cancer in a mouse model by a previously
unappreciated mechanism. 

The
article, entitled PP2Ac/STRN4 negatively regulates STING-Type I interferon signaling in tumor associated macrophages, was
recently published and is available online at https://www.jci.org/articles/view/162139. The authors state that PP2A/STRN4-YAP/TAZ
is a previously unappreciated mechanism that mediate[s] immunosuppression in tumor-associated macrophages and targeting PP2A/STRN4-YAP/TAZ
axis can sensitize tumors to immunotherapy.

The
following are comments by Dr. Kovach that were included in the news release: 

This
paper lends additional support to the potential immunotherapy application of LB-100 in cancer treatment. Dr. Winson S. Ho, Assistant
Professor of Neurological Surgery at the UCSF School of Medicine, co-lead author of the article, and a former member of the Company s
Board of Directors, bolsters the case for testing LB-100 in combination with immunotherapy in the clinic. Studies in animals show that
low doses of LB-100 enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy against a variety of cancer types by several mechanisms (Ho et al., Nature
Comm 2018; Yen et al. Nature Comm 2021). 

The
Company is currently recruiting for a clinical trial in patients with previously untreated extensive stage small cell lung cancer in
which LB-100 is first added to chemotherapy and an immune checkpoint blocker and then administered with the immune blocker alone in the
maintenance phase of treatment (NCT04560972). The Company is presently seeking to develop other collaborative clinical studies to determine
whether LB-100 significantly enhances the effectiveness of immunotherapy of cancer in general. 

Nasdaq
Notification of Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule 

On
June 24, 2022, the Company received an initial notification from Nasdaq related to our failure to maintain a minimum bid price of 1.00
per share for a period of 30 consecutive business days. The Nasdaq Listing Rules provided us a compliance period of 180 calendar days
in which to regain compliance, which in the case of the initial notification was December 21, 2022. As we did not regain compliance with
the minimum bid price requirement, by notice from Nasdaq dated December 22, 2022, we were afforded a second 180 calendar day compliance
period. Accordingly, if at any time from the date of this notice until June 19, 2023, the closing bid price of our common stock is at
least 1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide us with written confirmation of compliance and
the matter will be closed, although Nasdaq has the discretion to withhold such confirmation. 

In
order to achieve compliance with the minimum closing bid price per share requirement, the Company intends to file a proxy statement to
hold a special meeting of stockholders to seek approval to effect a reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of common
stock. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in this regard and will be able to regain compliance with
the minimum closing bid price requirement by June 19, 2023, in which case the Company anticipates Nasdaq would provide a notice to the
Company that its shares of common stock and warrants are subject to delisting, and the Company s common shares and warrants would
then be delisted. 

Further,
there can be no assurance that the market price per new share of our common stock after the reverse stock split will remain unchanged
or increase in proportion to the reduction in the number of old shares of our common stock outstanding before the reverse stock split.
Even if the reverse stock split is approved by our stockholders, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance
with the minimum bid price requirement in the future or will otherwise be able to maintain compliance with other Nasdaq listing rules. 

If
the Company is delisted from Nasdaq, its common stock and warrants may be eligible for trading on an over-the-counter market. If the
Company is not able to obtain a listing on another stock exchange or quotation service for its common stock and warrants, it may be extremely
difficult or impossible for stockholders to sell their shares of common stock and warrants. Moreover, if the Company is delisted from
Nasdaq, but obtains a substitute listing for its common stock and warrants, it will likely be on a market with less liquidity, and therefore
experience potentially more price volatility than experienced on Nasdaq. Stockholders may not be able to sell their shares of common
stock and warrants on any such substitute market in the quantities, at the times, or at the prices that could potentially be available
on a more liquid trading market. As a result of these factors, if the Company s common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, the value
and liquidity of the Company s common stock and warrants would likely be significantly adversely affected. A delisting of the Company s
common stock from Nasdaq could also adversely affect the Company s ability to obtain financing for its operations and/or could
result in a loss of confidence by investors, employees and/or business partners.

Going
Concern 

At
December 31, 2022, the Company had cash of 5,353,392 available to fund its operations. Because the Company is currently engaged in Phase
2 clinical trials, it is expected that it will take a significant amount of time and resources to develop any product or intellectual
property capable of generating sustainable revenues. Accordingly, the Company s business is unlikely to generate any sustainable
operating revenues in the next several years and may never do so. Even if the Company is able to generate revenues through licensing
its technology, product sales or other commercial activities, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve and
maintain positive earnings and operating cash flows. 

The
Company s consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has no recurring source of revenue
and has experienced negative operating cash flows since inception. The Company has financed its working capital requirements through
the recurring sale of its equity securities. 

As
a result, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company s consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional equity capital to fund its research
and development activities and to ultimately achieve sustainable operating revenues and profitability. The amount and timing of future
cash requirements depends on the pace, design and results of the Company s clinical trial program, which, in turn, depends on the
availability of operating capital to fund such activities. 

Based
on current operating plans, the Company estimates that existing cash resources will provide sufficient working capital to fund the current
clinical trial program with respect to the development of the Company s lead anti-cancer clinical compound LB-100 through approximately
December 31, 2023. Existing cash resources will not be sufficient to complete the development of and obtain regulatory approval for the
Company s product candidate, as a result of which the Company will need to raise significant additional capital to do so. The Company
estimates that it will need to raise additional capital to fund its operations, including its various clinical trial commitments, during
the latter part of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023. In addition, the Company s operating plans may change as a result
of many factors that are currently unknown and/or outside of the control of the Company, and additional funds may be needed sooner than
planned. 

As
market conditions present uncertainty as to the Company s ability to secure additional funds, there can be no assurance that the
Company will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms, as and when necessary, to continue to conduct operations. 

If
cash resources are insufficient to satisfy the Company s ongoing cash requirements, the Company would be required to scale back
or discontinue its clinical trial program, as well as its licensing and patent prosecution efforts and its technology and product development
efforts, or obtain funds, if available, through strategic alliances or joint ventures that could require the Company to relinquish rights
to and/or control of LB-100, or to discontinue operations entirely. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

In
December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes ASU 2019-12 ). ASU 2019-12 simplifies the
accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions and enhances and simplifies various aspects of the income tax accounting guidance
in ASC 740. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 effective January 1, 2021. The adoption of ASU 2019-12 did not have any impact on the Company s
consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures. 

- 60 - 

In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts
in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity ASU 2020-06 ). ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for convertible debt by eliminating the beneficial conversion and
cash conversion accounting models. Upon adoption of ASU 2020-06, convertible debt proceeds, unless issued with a substantial premium
or an embedded conversion feature that is not clearly and closely related to the host contract, will no longer be allocated between debt
and equity components. This modification will reduce the issue discount and result in less non-cash interest expense in financial statements.
ASU 2020-06 also updates the earnings per share calculation and requires entities to assume share settlement when the convertible debt
can be settled in cash or shares. For contracts in an entity s own equity, the type of contracts primarily affected by ASU 2020-06
are freestanding and embedded features that are accounted for as derivatives under the current guidance due to a failure to meet the
settlement assessment by removing the requirements to (i) consider whether the contract would be settled in registered shares, (ii) consider
whether collateral is required to be posted, and (iii) assess shareholder rights. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and only if
adopted as of the beginning of such fiscal year. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 effective January 1, 2021. The adoption of ASU 2020-06
did not have any impact on the Company s consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures. 

In
May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50),
Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic
815-40): Issuer s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options ASU
2021-04 ). ASU 2021-04 provides guidance as to how an issuer should account for a modification of the terms or conditions or an
exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option (i.e., a warrant) that remains classified after modification or exchange
as an exchange of the original instrument for a new instrument. An issuer should measure the effect of a modification or exchange as
the difference between the fair value of the modified or exchanged warrant and the fair value of that warrant immediately before modification
or exchange and then apply a recognition model that comprises four categories of transactions and the corresponding accounting treatment
for each category (equity issuance, debt origination, debt modification, and modifications unrelated to equity issuance and debt origination
or modification). ASU 2021-04 is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods
within those fiscal years. An entity should apply the guidance provided in ASU 2021-04 prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring
on or after the effective date. The Company adopted ASU 2021-04 effective January 1, 2022. The adoption of ASU 2021-04 did not have any
impact on the Company s consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures. 

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, authoritative guidance, if currently adopted, would have a material
impact on the Company s financial statement presentation or disclosures. 

Concentration
of Risk 

The
Company periodically contracts with vendors and consultants to provide services related to the Company s operations. Charges incurred
for these services can be for a specific time period (typically one year) or for a specific project or task. Costs and expenses incurred
that represented 10 or more of general and administrative costs or research and development costs for the years ended December 31, 2022
and 2021 are described as follows. 

General
and administrative costs for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 included charges from legal firms and other vendors for general
licensing and patent prosecution costs relating to the Company s intellectual properties representing 26.5 and 14.6 of total
general and administrative costs, respectively. General and administrative costs for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 also
included charges for the fair value of stock options granted to directors and corporate officers representing 30.3 and 44.2 , respectively,
of total general and administrative costs. 

Research
and development costs for the year ended December 30, 2022 included charges from four vendors and consultants representing 21.0 , 19.3 ,
15.1 and 12.1 , respectively, of total research and development costs. Research and development costs for the year ended December 31,
2021 included charges from three vendors and consultants representing 30.3 , 21.8 and 14.4 , respectively.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Some of those judgments
can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions
or conditions. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management regularly evaluates
the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances,
historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted accordingly.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include those related to assumptions used in the calculation
of accruals for clinical trial costs and other potential liabilities, valuing equity instruments issued for services, and the realization
of deferred tax assets. 

The
following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of the Company s
consolidated financial statements. 

Cash 

Cash
is held in a cash bank deposit program maintained by Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, a division of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC Morgan Stanley ). Morgan Stanley is a FINRA-regulated broker-dealer. The Company s policy is to maintain its cash
balances with financial institutions with high credit ratings and in accounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the
 FDIC and/or by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (the SIPC ). The Company periodically has cash
balances in financial institutions in excess of the FDIC and SIPC insurance limits of 250,000 and 500,000, respectively. Morgan Stanley
Wealth Management also maintains supplemental insurance coverage for the cash balances of its customers. The Company has not experienced
any losses to date resulting from this policy. 

Segment
Information 

The
Company operates and reports in one segment, which focuses on the utilization of biomarker technology to identify enzyme targets associated
with serious common diseases and then designing novel compounds to attack those targets. The Company s operating segment is reported
in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker, which is the Company s President,
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Scientific Officer. 

Research
and Development 

Research
and development costs consist primarily of fees paid to consultants and contractors, and other expenses relating to the acquisition,
design, development and clinical trials with respect to the Company s clinical compound and product candidate. Research and development
costs also include the costs to manufacture the compounds used in research and clinical trials, which are charged to operations as incurred.
The Company s inventory of LB-100 for clinical use has been manufactured separately in the United States and in the European Union
in accordance with the laws and regulations of such jurisdictions. 

Research
and development costs are generally charged to operations ratably over the life of the underlying contracts, unless the achievement of
milestones, the completion of contracted work, the termination of an agreement, or other information indicates that a different expensing
schedule is more appropriate. However, payments for research and development costs that are contractually defined as non-refundable are
charged to operations as incurred. 

Obligations
incurred with respect to mandatory scheduled payments under agreements with milestone provisions are recognized as charges to research
and development costs in the Company s consolidated statement of operations based on the achievement of such milestones, as specified
in the respective agreement. Obligations incurred with respect to mandatory scheduled payments under agreements without milestone provisions
are accounted for when due, are recognized ratably over the appropriate period, as specified in the respective agreement, and are recorded
as liabilities in the Company s consolidated balance sheet, with a corresponding charge to research and development costs in the
Company s consolidated statement of operations. 

- 62 - 

Payments
made pursuant to contracts are initially recorded as advances on research and development contract services in the Company s consolidated
balance sheet and are then charged to research and development costs in the Company s consolidated statement of operations as those
contract services are performed. Expenses incurred under contracts in excess of amounts advanced are recorded as research and development
contract liabilities in the Company s consolidated balance sheet, with a corresponding charge to research and development costs
in the Company s consolidated statement of operations. The Company reviews the status of its various clinical trial and research
and development contracts on a quarterly basis. 

Patent
and Licensing Legal and Filing Fees and Costs 

Due
to the significant uncertainty associated with the successful development of one or more commercially viable products based on the Company s
research efforts and related patent applications, all patent and licensing legal and filing fees and costs are charged to operations
as incurred. Patent and licensing legal and filing fees and costs are included in general and administrative costs in the Company s
consolidated statements of operations. 

During
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, patent and licensing legal and filing fees and costs related to the development and protection
of the Company s intellectual property were 1,268,308 and 729,171, respectively, an increase of 539,137, or 73.9 , in 2022 as
compared to 2021. 

In
late 2021, the Company engaged a new patent law firm that is highly regarded for its expertise in biotechnology. This firm conducted
a comprehensive analysis of the Company s extensive patent portfolio in order to implement a program to maximize intellectual property
protection, both domestically and internationally. In addition, several patents were filed in 2022, reflecting potential new uses of
the Company s lead clinical compound LB-100 in cancer therapy. These activities resulted in an increase in patent and licensing
legal and filing fees and costs in 2022 as compared to 2021. The Company expects that patent and licensing legal and filing fees and
costs will continue to increase in 2023 as compared to 2022, although at a slower rate of increase, as the Company continues to develop
and expand its patent portfolio related to the clinical development of LB-100. 

A
descriptive summary of the patent portfolio for the Company s most important clinical programs involving the development of LB-100,
as well as a detailed listing of each domestic and international patent that has been issued, is presented at ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Intellectual Property . 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

The
Company periodically issues common stock and stock options to officers, directors, employees, Scientific Advisory Committee members,
contractors and consultants for services rendered. Options vest and expire according to terms established at the issuance date of each
grant. Stock grants, which are generally time vested, are measured at the grant date fair value and charged to operations ratably over
the vesting period. 

The
Company accounts for stock-based payments to officers, directors, employees, Scientific Advisory Committee members, contractors and consultants
by measuring the cost of services received in exchange for equity awards utilizing the grant date fair value of the awards, with the
cost recognized as compensation expense on the straight-line basis in the Company s financial statements over the vesting period
of the awards. 

The
fair value of stock options granted as stock-based compensation is determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, and is
affected by several variables, the most significant of which are the expected life of the stock option, the exercise price of the stock
option as compared to the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date, and the estimated volatility of the common stock.
Unless sufficient historical exercise data is available, the expected life of the stock option is calculated as the mid-point between
the vesting period and the contractual term (the simplified method ). The estimated volatility is based on the historical
volatility of the Company s common stock, calculated utilizing a look-back period approximately equal to the contractual life of
the stock option being granted. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
The fair market value of the common stock is determined by reference to the quoted market price of the Company s common stock on
the grant date. The expected dividend yield is based on the Company s expectation of dividend payouts and is assumed to be zero. 

- 63 - 

The
Company recognizes the fair value of stock-based compensation awards in general and administrative costs and in research and development
costs, as appropriate, in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. The Company issues new shares of common stock to
satisfy stock option exercises. 

Summary
of Business Activities and Plans 

Company
Overview 

The
Company is a drug discovery company that uses biomarker technology to identify enzyme targets associated with serious common diseases
and then designs novel compounds to attack those targets. The Company s product pipeline is primarily focused on inhibitors of
protein phosphatases, used alone and in combination with cytotoxic agents and/or x-ray and immune checkpoint blockers, and encompasses
two major categories of compounds at various stages of pre-clinical and clinical development that the Company believes have broad therapeutic
potential not only for cancer but also for other debilitating and life-threatening diseases. 

The
Company is focusing its development activities on its LB-100 series of drugs. The Company believes that the mechanism by which compounds
of the LB-100 series affect cancer cell growth is different from cancer agents currently approved for clinical use. Lead compounds from
each series have activity against a broad spectrum of common and rarer human cancers in cell culture systems. In addition, compounds
from both series have anti-cancer activity in animal models of glioblastoma multiforme, neuroblastoma, and medulloblastoma, all cancers
of neural tissue. Lead compounds of the LB-100 series also have activity against melanoma, breast cancer and sarcoma in animal models
and enhance the effectiveness of commonly used anti-cancer drugs in these animal models. The enhancement of anti-cancer activity of these
anti-cancer drugs occurs at doses of LB-100 that do not significantly increase toxicity in animals. It is therefore hoped that, when
combined with standard anti-cancer regimens against many tumor types, the Company s compounds will improve therapeutic benefit
without enhancing toxicity in humans. The Company is not currently planning to allocate resources to further develop its LB-200 series
of drugs, 

Product
Candidates 

The
LB-100 series consists of novel structures which have the potential to be first in their class and may be useful in the treatment of
not only several types of cancer but also vascular and metabolic diseases. The LB-200 series contains compounds which have the potential
to be the most effective in its class and may be useful for the treatment of chronic hereditary diseases, such as Gaucher s disease,
in addition to cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. 

The
Company has demonstrated that lead compounds of both the LB-100 series and the LB-200 are active against a broad spectrum of human cancers
in cell culture and against several types of human cancers in animal models. The research on these compounds was initiated in 2006 under
a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, or CRADA, with the National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke, or NINDS,
of the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, dated March 22, 2006 that was subsequently extended through a series of amendments until
it terminated on April 1, 2013. As discussed below, the Company s primary focus is on the clinical development of LB-100. 

The
LB-200 series consists of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). Many pharmaceutical companies are also developing drugs of this type,
and at least two companies have HDACi approved for clinical use, in both cases for the treatment of a type of lymphoma. Despite this
significant competition, the Company has demonstrated that its HDACi have broad activity against many cancer types, have neuroprotective
activity, and have anti-fungal activity. In addition, these compounds have low toxicity. LB-200 has not yet advanced to the clinical
stage and would require additional capital to fund further development. Accordingly, because of the Company s focus on the clinical
development of LB-100 and analogs for cancer therapy as described below in more detail, the Company has decided not to actively pursue
the pre-clinical development of the LB-200 series of compounds. At this time, the Company intends to only maintain composition and synthesis
patents on the LB-200 series of compounds in the United States. 

- 64 - 

Collaborations
with leading academic research centers in the United States, Europe and Asia have established the breadth of activity of LB-100 in pre-clinical
models of several major cancers. There is considerable scientific interest in LB-100 because it exerts its activity by a novel mechanism
and is the first of its type to be evaluated so broadly in multiple animal models of cancer and now in human beings. LB-100 is one of
a series of serine/threonine phosphatase (s/t ptase) inhibitors designed by the Company. The s/t ptases are ubiquitous enzymes that regulate
many cell signaling networks important to cell growth, division and death. The s/t ptases have long been appreciated as potentially important
targets for anti-cancer drugs. However, because of the multi- functionality of these enzymes, it had been widely held that pharmacologic
inhibitors of s/t ptases would be too toxic to allow their development as anti-cancer treatments, but the Company has shown that this
is not the case. LB-100 was well tolerated at doses associated with objective regression (significant tumor shrinkage) and/or the arresting
of tumor progression in patients with progressive cancers. 

Pre-clinical
studies showed that LB-100 itself inhibits a spectrum of human cancers and that combined with standard cytotoxic drugs and/or radiation,
LB-100 potentiates their effectiveness against hematologic and solid tumor cancers without enhancing toxicity. Given at very low doses
in animal models of cancer, LB-100 markedly increased the effectiveness of a PD-1 blocker, one of the widely used new immunotherapy drugs.
This finding raises the possibility that LB-100 may further expand the value of the expanding field of cancer immunotherapy. 

The
Company completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100 to evaluate its safety that showed it is associated with antitumor activity in humans
at doses that are readily tolerable. Responses included objective regression (tumor shrinkage) lasting for 11 months of a pancreatic
cancer and cessation of growth (stabilization of disease) for 4 months or more of 9 other progressive solid tumors out of 20 patients
who had measurable disease. As Phase 1 clinical trials are fundamentally designed to determine safety of a new compound in humans, the
Company was encouraged by these results. The next step is to demonstrate in Phase 2 clinical trials the efficacy of LB-100 in one or
more specific tumor types, against which the compound has well documented activity in pre-clinical models. 

As
a compound moves through the FDA-approval process, it becomes an increasingly valuable property, but at a cost of additional investment
at each stage. As the potential effectiveness of LB-100 has been documented at the clinical trial level, the Company has allocated resources
to expand the breadth and depth of its patent portfolio. The Company s approach has been to operate with a minimum of overhead,
moving compounds forward as efficiently and inexpensively as possible, and to raise funds to support each of these stages as certain
milestones are reached. The Company s longer-term objective is to secure one or more strategic partnerships or licensing agreements
with pharmaceutical companies with major programs in cancer. 

External
Risks Associated with the Company s Business Activities 

Covid-19
Virus . The global outbreak of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) in early 2020 led to disruptions in general economic activities throughout
the world as businesses and governments implemented broad actions to mitigate this public health crisis. The extent to which the coronavirus
pandemic may impact the Company s business activities and capital raising efforts will depend on future developments, which are
uncertain and cannot be predicted. The Company is continuing to monitor this situation and will adjust its current business plans to
the extent additional information and guidance become available. The coronavirus pandemic has also presented a challenge to medical facilities
worldwide. Although the Company s clinical trials are conducted on an outpatient basis, the coronavirus pandemic appears to have
caused some delays in the Company s clinical trials, but the impact of the coronavirus pandemic appears to be subsiding. 

Inflation
Risk. The Company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its operations to date, other than its impact on the
general economy. However, there is a risk that the Company s operating costs could become subject to inflationary and interest
rate pressures in the future, which would have the effect of increasing the Company s operating costs (including, specifically,
clinical trial costs), and which would put additional stress on the Company s working capital resources.

Chain Issues. The Company does not currently expect that supply chain issues will have a significant impact on its business activities,
including its ongoing clinical trials. 

Potential
Recession. There are various indications that the United States economy may be entering a recessionary period. Although unclear at
this time, an economic recession would likely impact the general business environment and the capital markets, which could, in turn,
affect the Company. 

The
Company is continuing to monitor these matters and will adjust its current business and financing plans as more information and guidance
become available.

At
December 31, 2022, the Company had working capital of 5,165,227, as compared to working capital of 4,790,338 at December 31, 2021,
reflecting an increase in working capital of 374,889 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in working capital during the
year ended December 31, 2022 was the result of the Company completing the sale of 2,900,000 shares of common stock at a price of 2.00
per share in a registered direct equity offering on April 12, 2022, generating net proceeds of 5,141,384, reduced by the funding of
the Company s ongoing research and development activities and other ongoing operating expenses, including maintaining and developing
its patent portfolio. At December 31, 2022, the Company had cash of 5,353,392 available to fund its operations. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional equity capital to fund its research
and development activities and to ultimately achieve sustainable operating revenues and profitability. The amount and timing of future
cash requirements depends on the pace, design and results of the Company s clinical trial program, which, in turn, depends on the
availability of operating capital to fund such activities. 

Based
on current operating plans, the Company estimates that existing cash resources will provide sufficient working capital to fund the current
clinical trial program with respect to the development of the Company s lead anti-cancer clinical compound LB-100 through approximately
December 31, 2023. However, existing cash resources will not be sufficient to complete the development of and obtain regulatory approval
for the Company s product candidate, as a result of which the Company will need to raise significant additional capital to do so.
The Company estimates that it will need to raise additional capital to fund its operations, including its various clinical trial commitments,
during the latter part of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023. In addition, the Company s operating plans may change as a
result of many factors that are currently unknown and/or outside of the control of the Company, and additional funds may be needed sooner
than planned. 

At
December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any transactions, obligations or relationships that could be considered off-balance sheet
arrangements. 

Operating
Activities . For the year ended December 31, 2022, operating activities utilized cash of 4,611,737, as compared to utilizing cash
of 4,142,915 for the year ended December 31, 2021, to fund the Company s ongoing research and development activities and to fund
its other ongoing operating expenses, including maintaining and developing its patent portfolio. 

Investing
Activities . For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no investing activities. 

Financing
Activities . For the year December 31, 2022, financing activities consisted of the gross proceeds from the sale of common stock in
the Company s direct equity offering of 5,800,000, reduced by offering costs of 658,616. For the year ended December 31, 2021,
financing activities consisted of the gross proceeds from the sale of common stock in the Company s direct equity offering of 4,192,478,
reduced by offering costs of 502,717, 17,100 from the exercise of common stock warrants, and 201,000 from the exercise of common stock
options. The Company also paid public offering costs related to its November 2020 public offering of 10,467 during the year ended December
31, 2021 related to the Company s financing activities. 

Principal
Commitments 

At
December 31, 2022, the Company s unpaid remaining contractual commitments pursuant to clinical trial agreements, and clinical trial
monitoring agreements, as described below, aggregated 7,892,000, which are currently scheduled to be incurred through December 31, 2025.
The Company s ability to conduct and fund these contractual commitments is subject to the timely availability of sufficient capital
to fund such expenditures, as well as any changes in the allocation or reallocation of such funds to the Company s current or future
clinical trial programs. The Company expects that the full amount of these expenditures will be incurred only if such clinical trial
programs are conducted as originally designed and their respective enrollments and duration are not modified or reduced. Clinical trial
programs, such as the types that the Company is engaged in, can be highly variable and can frequently involve a series of changes and
modifications over time as clinical data is obtained and analyzed, and are frequently modified, suspended or terminated before the clinical
trial endpoint. Accordingly, such contractual commitments as discussed herein should be considered as estimates only based on current
clinical assumptions and conditions, and are typically subject to significant revisions over time.

Clinical
Trial Agreements 

Moffitt.
 Effective August 20, 2018, the Company entered into a Clinical Trial Research Agreement with the Moffitt Cancer Center and Research
Institute Hospital Inc., Tampa, Florida, effective for a term of five years, unless terminated earlier by the Company pursuant to 30
days written notice. Pursuant to the Clinical Trial Research Agreement, Moffitt agreed to conduct and manage a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial
to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of the Company s lead anti-cancer clinical compound LB-100 to be administered intravenously
in patients with low or intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). 

In
November 2018, the Company received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its Investigational New Drug Application IND to conduct a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of LB-100 in patients with low and intermediate-1
risk MDS who have failed or are intolerant of standard treatment. Patients with MDS, although usually older, are generally well except
for severe anemia requiring frequent blood transfusions. This Phase 1b/2 clinical trial utilizes LB-100 as a single agent in the treatment
of patients with low and intermediate-1 risk MDS, including patients with del(5q) myelodysplastic syndrome (del5qMDS) failing first line
therapy. The bone marrow cells of patients with del5qMDS are deficient in PP2A by virtue of an acquired mutation and are especially vulnerable
to further inhibition of PP2A by LB-100. The clinical trial began at a single site in April 2019 and the first patient was entered into
the clinical trial in July 2019. A total enrollment of 41 patients is planned. An interim analysis will be done after the first 21 patients
are entered. If there are 3 or more responders but fewer than 7, an additional 20 patients will be entered. If at any point there are
7 or more responders, this will be sufficient evidence to support continued development of LB-100 for the treatment of low and intermediate-1
risk MDS. Recruitment has been slow and the Covid-19 pandemic has further reduced recruitment of patients into the protocol. At the current
rate of accrual, the clinical trial is expected to be completed by June 30, 2025. However, with additional funds, the Company would consider
adding two additional MDS centers to the Phase 2 portion of the study to accelerate patient accrual. 

During
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred costs of 26,397 and 18,443, respectively, pursuant to this agreement,
which have been included in research and development costs in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. As of December
31, 2022, total costs of 131,074 have been incurred pursuant to this agreement. The Company s aggregate commitment pursuant to
this agreement, less amounts previously paid to date, totaled approximately 590,000 as of December 31, 2022, which is expected to be
incurred through December 31, 2025. 

GEIS.
 Effective July 31, 2019, the Company entered into a Collaboration Agreement for an Investigator-Initiated Clinical Trial with the
Spanish Sarcoma Group (Grupo Espa ol de Investigaci n en Sarcomas or GEIS ), Madrid, Spain, to carry out a
study entitled Randomized phase I/II trial of LB-100 plus doxorubicin vs. doxorubicin alone in first line of advanced soft tissue
sarcoma . The purpose of this clinical trial is to obtain information with respect to the efficacy and safety of LB-100 combined
with doxorubicin in soft tissue sarcomas. Doxorubicin is the global standard for initial treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcomas ASTS ).
Doxorubicin alone has been the mainstay of first line treatment of ASTS for over 40 years, with little therapeutic gain from adding cytotoxic
compounds to or substituting other cytotoxic compounds for doxorubicin. In animal models, LB-100 consistently enhances the anti-tumor
activity of doxorubicin without apparent increases in toxicity. 

- 69 - 

GEIS
has a network of referral centers in Spain and across Europe that have an impressive track record of efficiently conducting innovative
studies in ASTS. The Company agreed to provide GEIS with a supply of LB-100 to be utilized in the conduct of this clinical trial, as
well as to provide funding for the clinical trial. The goal is to enter approximately 150 patients in this clinical trial over a period
of two years. As advanced sarcoma is a very aggressive disease, the design of the study assumes a median progression free survival (PFS,
no evidence of disease progression or death from any cause) of 4.5 months in the doxorubicin arm and an alternative median PFS of 7.5
months in the doxorubicin plus LB-100 arm to demonstrate a statistically significant decrease in relative risk of progression or death
by adding LB-100. There is a planned interim analysis of the primary endpoint when approximately 50 of the 102 events required for final
analysis is reached. 

The
Company had previously expected that this clinical trial would commence during the quarter ended June 30, 2020. However, during July
2020, the Spanish regulatory authority advised the Company that although it had approved the scientific and ethical basis of the protocol,
it required that the Company manufacture new inventory of LB-100 under current Spanish pharmaceutical manufacturing standards. These
standards were adopted subsequent to the production of the Company s existing LB-100 inventory. 

In
order to manufacture a new inventory supply of LB-100 for the GEIS clinical trial, the Company engaged a number of vendors to carry out
the multiple tasks needed to make and gain approval of a new clinical product for investigational study in Spain. These tasks included
the synthesis under good manufacturing practices (GMP) of the active pharmacologic ingredient (API), with documentation of each of the
steps involved by an independent auditor. The API was then transferred to a vendor that prepares the clinical drug product, also under
GMP conditions documented by an independent auditor. The clinical drug product was then sent to a vendor to test for purity and sterility,
provide appropriate labels, store the drug, and distribute the drug to the clinical centers for use in the clinical trials. A formal
application documenting all steps taken to prepare the clinical drug product for clinical use must be submitted to the appropriate regulatory
authorities for review and approval before being used in a clinical trial. 

As
of December 31, 2022, this program to provide new inventory of the clinical drug product for the Spanish Sarcoma Group study, and potentially
for subsequent multiple trials within the European Union, had cost 1,144,169. While the production of new inventory has been completed,
nominal amounts of trailing costs are expected to be incurred during the year ending December 31, 2023. 

On
October 13, 2022, the Company announced that the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Products (Agencia Espa ola de Medicamentos
y Productos Sanitarios or AEMPS had authorized a Phase 1b/randomized Phase 2 study of LB-100, the Company s lead
clinical compound, plus doxorubicin, versus doxorubicin alone, the global standard for initial treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcomas
(ASTS). Consequently, the GEIS clinical trial is currently scheduled to commence during the quarter ending June 30, 2023 and to be completed
by December 31, 2025. Up to 170 patents will be entered into the clinical trial. The Phase 1b section of the protocol is expected to
be completed by June 30, 2024, at which time the Company expects to have data on both response and toxicity from this portion of the
clinical trial. 

The
interim analysis of this clinical trial will be done before full accrual of patients is completed to determine whether the study has
the possibility of showing superiority of the combination of LB-100 plus doxorubicin compared to doxorubicin alone. A positive study
would have the potential to change the standard therapy for this disease after four decades of failure to improve the marginal benefit
of doxorubicin alone. 

The
Company s agreement with GEIS provides for various payments based on achieving specific milestones over the term of the agreement.
Through December 31, 2022, the Company has paid GEIS an aggregate of 415,823 for work done under this agreement through the third milestone. 

During
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred costs of 260,770 and 24,171, respectively, pursuant to this agreement,
which have been included in research and development costs in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. As of December
31, 2022, total costs of 415,823 have been incurred pursuant to this agreement. The Company s aggregate commitment pursuant to
this agreement, less amounts previously paid to date, totaled approximately 3,743,000 as of December 31, 2022, which is expected to
be incurred through December 31, 2025. As the work is being conducted in Europe and is paid for in Euros, final costs are subject to
foreign currency fluctuations between the United States Dollar and the Euro. Such fluctuations are recorded in the consolidated statements
of operations as foreign currency gain or loss, as appropriate.

City
of Hope. Effective January 18, 2021, the Company executed a Clinical Research Support Agreement with the City of Hope National Medical
Center, an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, and City of Hope Medical Foundation (collectively, City of Hope ),
to carry out a Phase 1b clinical trial of LB-100, the Company s first-in-class protein phosphatase inhibitor, combined with a standard
regimen for treatment of untreated extensive- stage disease small cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC). LB-100 will be given in combination with
carboplatin, etoposide and atezolizumab, an FDA-approved but marginally effective regimen, to previously untreated ED-SCLC patients.
The dose of LB-100 will be escalated with the standard fixed doses of the 3-drug regimen to reach a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).
Patient entry will be expanded so that a total of 12 patients will be evaluable at the RP2D to confirm the safety of the LB-100 combination
and to look for potential therapeutic activity as assessed by objective response rate, duration of overall response, progression-free-survival
and overall survival. 

The
clinical trial was initiated on March 9, 2021, with patient accrual expected to take approximately two years to complete. However, as
patient accrual has been slower than expected, the Company is currently seeking to add two additional sites to increase the rate of patient
accrual, with at least one major site expected to be added by June 30, 2023. With the additional sites, the Company expects that this
clinical trial will be completed by December 31, 2024. Without the additional sites, the Company expects that this clinical trial will
be completed no sooner than December 31, 2025. 

Effective
March 6, 2023, Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI), Nashville, Tennessee, joined the City of Hope s ongoing Phase 1b clinical
trial to assess the combination of the Company s first-in-class protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor, LB-100, with a standard
regimen for previously untreated, extensive stage small cell lung cancer disease. SCRI, one of the largest community-based cancer trial
centers in the United States, is expected to expedite and expand the accrual of patients to this clinical trial, thus reducing the time
required to demonstrate the feasibility, tolerability and efficacy of adding LB-100 to the current standard treatment regimen. 

During
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred costs of 0 and 378,511, respectively, pursuant to this agreement.
The Company s aggregate commitment pursuant to this agreement, less amounts previously paid to date, totaled approximately 2,433,000
as of December 31, 2022, which is expected to be incurred through December 31, 2024, based upon a target of 42 enrollees. If a significant
number of patients fail during the dose-escalation process, an increase of up to 12 patients would likely be necessary, at an estimated
additional cost of approximately 800,000. 

The
Company currently expects that enrollment in this clinical trial will range from approximately 18 to 30 enrollees, with 24 enrollees
as the most likely number. Should fewer than 42 enrollees be required, the Company has agreed to compensate City of Hope on a per enrollee
basis. If a significant improvement in outcome is seen with the addition of LB-100, this would be an important advance in the treatment
of a very aggressive disease. 

National
Cancer Institute Pharmacologic Clinical Trial. In May 2019, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) initiated a glioblastoma (GBM) pharmacologic
clinical trial. This study is being conducted and funded by the NCI under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, with the
Company being required to provide the LB-100 clinical compound. 

Primary
malignant brain tumors (gliomas) are very challenging to treat. Radiation combined with the chemotherapeutic drug temozolomide has been
the mainstay of therapy of the most aggressive gliomas (glioblastoma multiforme or GBM) for decades, with some further benefit gained
by the addition of one or more anti-cancer drugs, but without major advances in overall survival for the majority of patients. In animal
models of GBM, the Company s novel protein phosphatase inhibitor, LB-100, has been found to enhance the effectiveness of radiation,
temozolomide chemotherapy treatments and immunotherapy, raising the possibility that LB-100 may improve outcomes of standard GBM treatment
in the clinic. Although LB-100 has proven safe in patients at doses associated with apparent anti-tumor activity against several human
cancers arising outside the brain, the ability of LB-100 to penetrate tumor tissue arising in the brain is not known. Unfortunately,
many drugs potentially useful for GBM treatment do not enter the brain in amounts necessary for anti-cancer action. 

- 71 - 

The
NCI study is designed to determine the extent to which LB-100 enters recurrent malignant gliomas. Patients having surgery to remove one
or more tumors will receive one dose of LB-100 prior to surgery and have blood and tumor tissue analyzed to determine the amount of LB-100
present and to determine whether the cells in the tumors show the biochemical changes expected to be present if LB-100 reaches its molecular
target. As a result of the innovative design of the NCI study, data from a few patients should be sufficient to provide a sound rationale
for conducting a larger clinical trial to determine the effectiveness of adding LB-100 to the standard treatment regimen for GBMs. Five
patients have been entered and analysis of the blood and tissue will now proceed. If there is evidence in at least two of the patients
of penetration of LB 100 into tumor tissue, the study will be deemed as successful. The results of this study are expected during 2023. 

Clinical
Trial Monitoring Agreements 

Moffitt.
 On September 12, 2018, the Company finalized a work order agreement with Theradex Systems, Inc. Theradex ), an international
contract research organization CRO ), to monitor the Phase 1b/2 clinical trial being managed and conducted by Moffitt.
The clinical trial began in April 2019 and the first patient was entered into the clinical trial in July 2019. At the current rate of
accrual, the clinical trial is expected to be completed by June 30, 2025. 

Costs
under this work order agreement are estimated to be approximately 954,000, with such payments expected to be allocated approximately
94 to Theradex for services and approximately 6 for payments for pass-through costs. The costs of the Phase 1b/2 clinical trial being
paid to or through Theradex are being recorded and charged to operations based on periodic documentation provided by the CRO. During
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred costs of 35,403 and 9,730, respectively, and as of December 31, 2022,
total costs of 127,288 have been incurred. The Company s aggregate commitment pursuant to this agreement, less amounts previously
paid to date, totaled approximately 842,000 as of December 31, 2022, which is expected to be incurred through June 30, 2025. 

City
of Hope. On February 5, 2021, the Company signed a new work order agreement with Theradex to monitor the City of Hope investigator-initiated
clinical trial in small cell lung cancer in accordance with FDA requirements for oversight by the sponsoring party. 

Costs
under this work order agreement are estimated to be approximately 335,000. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company

Foundation
for Angelman Syndrome Therapy . Effective August 12, 2020, the Company entered into a Master Service Agreement with the Foundation
for Angelman Syndrome Therapy (FAST) to collaborate in supporting pre-clinical studies of the potential benefit of LB-100 in a mouse
model of Angelman Syndrome (AS) as reported in The Proceedings of The National Academy of Science (Wang et al, June 3, 2019). The pre-clinical
studies were to be conducted at The University of California - Davis under the direction of Dr. David Segal, an internationally recognized
leader in AS research. If the pre-clinical studies confirm that LB-100 reduces AS signs in rodent models, the Company has agreed to enter
into discussions with FAST with respect to possible collaborations to most efficiently assess the benefit of LB-100 in patients with
AS, which is a rare disease affecting an estimated one out of 12,000 to one out of 20,000 persons in the United States. The genetic cause
of AS, reduced function of a specific maternal gene called Ube3, has been understood for some time, but the molecular abnormality resulting
from the genetic lesion has now been shown to be increased concentrations of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a molecular target of the
Company s investigational compound, LB-100. The Company has agreed to provide FAST with a supply of LB-100 to be utilized in the
conduct of this study, which was initially expected to be completed within three years. Conditioned on FAST s completion of this
study, the Company has agreed to pay FAST five percent (5 of all proceeds, as defined in the Master Service Agreement, received by
the Company, up to a maximum of 250,000, from the exploitation of the study results. 

The
research team at the University of California - Davis recently completed their pre-clinical study of the potential benefit of LB-100
in a mouse model of AS. The preliminary analysis indicates that the positive results previously reported by Chinese investigators were
not confirmed in the US model. The Company is currently awaiting input from FAST as to whether it intends to continue to pursue pre-clinical
studies of LB 100. To date, FAST has not indicated whether it desires to pursue further studies of LB-100, but in light of the failure
to confirm the Chinese study results, the Company does not plan to pursue further studies of AS. 

Netherlands
Cancer Institute. On October 8, 2021, the Company entered into a Development Collaboration Agreement with the Netherlands Cancer
Institute, Amsterdam, one of the world s leading comprehensive cancer centers, and Oncode Institute, Utrecht, a major independent
cancer research center, to identify the most promising drugs to be combined with LB-100, and potentially LB-100 analogues, to be used
to treat a range of cancers, as well as to identify the specific molecular mechanisms underlying the identified combinations. The Company
has agreed to fund the study and provide a sufficient supply of LB-100 to conduct the study. The study is expected to take approximately
two years to conduct. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred charges in the amount of 204,158 and 55,248,
respectively, with respect to this agreement, which amounts are included in research and development costs in the Company s consolidated
statements of operations. As of December 31, 2022, total costs of 259,406 have been incurred pursuant to this agreement. The Company s
aggregate commitment pursuant to this agreement, less amounts previously paid to date, totaled approximately 262,000 as of December
31, 2022, which is expected to be incurred through June 30, 2025. As the work is being conducted in Europe and is paid for in Euros,
final costs are subject to foreign currency fluctuations between the United States Dollar and the Euro. 

MRI
Global. The Company has contracted with MRI Global for stability analysis, storage and distribution of LB-100 for clinical trials
in the United States. On June 10, 2022, the contract was amended to reflect a new total contract price of 273,980 and an estimated completion
date of April 30, 2023. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred costs of 27,702 and 17,782, respectively,
pursuant to this agreement. As of December 31, 2022, total costs of 219,611 have been incurred pursuant to this agreement. The Company s
aggregate commitment pursuant to this agreement, less amounts previously paid to date, totaled approximately 55,000 as of December 31,
2022. 

Trends,
Events and Uncertainties 

Research
and development of new pharmaceutical compounds is, by its nature, unpredictable. Although we will undertake research and development
efforts with commercially reasonable diligence, there can be no assurance that our cash position will be sufficient to enable us to develop
our pharmaceutical compounds to the extent needed to create future sales to sustain operations as contemplated herein. 

- 74 - 

There
can be no assurance that one or more of our pharmaceutical compounds will obtain the regulatory approvals and market acceptance to achieve
sustainable revenues sufficient to support our operations. Even if we are able to generate revenues, there can be no assurance that we
will be able to achieve operating profitability or positive operating cash flows. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure
additional financing, to the extent required, on acceptable terms or at all. If cash resources are insufficient to satisfy our ongoing
cash requirements, we would be required to reduce or discontinue our research and development programs, or attempt to obtain funds, if
available, through strategic alliances that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our pharmaceutical compounds, or to curtail
or discontinue our operations entirely. 

Other
than as discussed above, we are not currently aware of any trends, events or uncertainties that are likely to have a material effect
on our financial condition in the near term, although it is possible that new trends or events may develop in the future that could have
a material effect on our financial condition.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The
Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) that is designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its
principal executive officer(s) and principal financial officer(s), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. 

In
accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, an evaluation was completed under the supervision and with the participation of
the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the end of the
most recent fiscal year covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Company s management concluded that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the
Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ).

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

The
Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control
over financial reporting is a process, including policies and procedures, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to ensure that material information
regarding the Company s operations is made available to management and the Board of Directors to provide them reasonable assurance
that the published financial statements are fairly presented. 

The
Company s management assessed the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the Internal Control Integrated
Framework (2013 Framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). The Company s
system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those
systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Furthermore, smaller
reporting companies face additional limitations. Smaller reporting companies employ fewer individuals and find it more difficult to properly
segregate duties. Smaller reporting companies tend to utilize general accounting software packages that lack a rigorous set of software
controls. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or deterred on a timely basis. 

Based
on the Company s evaluation under the framework in COSO, the Company s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2022. 

Management
believes that the consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, the Company s
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the period ended December 31, 2022. 

Auditor s
Report on Internal Control Over Financing Reporting 

This
report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent registered
public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this report. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

The
Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has determined that no change in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13(a)-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934) occurred during or subsequent to the period ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Committees
of Our Board of Directors 

Our
Board of Directors directs the management of our business and affairs, as provided by Delaware law, and conducts its business through
meetings of the Board of Directors and its standing committees. We have a standing audit committee and compensation committee. The Board
of Directors serves in place of a nominating and corporate governance committee. In addition, from time to time, special committees may
be established under the direction of the Board of Directors when necessary to address specific issues. 

Audit
Committee 

Our
audit committee is responsible for, among other things: 

approving and retaining
 the independent auditors to conduct the annual audit of our financial statements; 

reviewing the proposed
 scope and results of the audit; 

reviewing and pre-approving
 audit and non-audit fees and services; 

reviewing accounting and
 financial controls with the independent auditors and our financial and accounting staff; 

reviewing and approving
 transactions between us and our directors, officers and affiliates; 

establishing procedures
 for complaints received by us regarding accounting matters; 

overseeing internal audit
 functions, if any; and 

preparing the report of
 the audit committee that the rules of the SEC require to be included in our annual meeting proxy statement. 

Our
audit committee consists of Regina Brown, Dr. Yun Yen, and Bas van der Baan, with Ms. Brown serving as chair. Our Board of Directors
has affirmatively determined that each of the committee members meet the definition of independent director under the Nasdaq
rules, and that they meet the independence standards under Rule 10A-3. Each member of our audit committee meets the financial literacy

- 81 - 

Our
compensation committee consists of Dr. Yun Yen, Dr. Stephen Forman and Dr. Ren Bernards, with Dr. Yen serving as chair. Our Board
of Directors has determined that all three committee members are independent directors under Nasdaq rules. Our Board of Directors has
adopted a written charter for the compensation committee, which is available on our principal corporate website at www.lixte.com . 

Nominating
and Corporate Governance 

Although
our Board of Directors serves in place of a nominating and corporate governance committee, our independent directors on the board are
responsible for, among other things: 

nominating members of the
 Board of Directors; 

developing a set of corporate
 governance principles applicable to our company; and 

overseeing the evaluation
 of our Board of Directors. 

Our
Board of Directors may adopt resolutions addressing, among other things, the nomination process, as may be necessary in the future. 

Code
of Ethics 

Our
Board of Directors has adopted a code of ethics covering all of our executive officers and key employees. A copy of our code of ethics
will be furnished without charge to any person upon written request. Requests should be sent to: Secretary, Lixte Biotechnology Holdings,
Inc., 680 East Colorado Boulevard, Suite 180, Pasadena, California 91101. 

Limitations
on Liability and Indemnification Matters 

Our
Certificate of Incorporation contains provisions that limit the liability of our current and former directors for monetary damages to
the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that directors of a corporation will not be personally liable for
monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duties as directors, except liability for: 

any breach of the director s
 duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders; 

any act or omission not
 in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; 

unlawful payments of dividends
 or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions as provided in Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law; or 

any transaction from which
 the director derived an improper personal benefit. 

This
limitation of liability does not apply to liabilities arising under federal securities laws and does not affect the availability of equitable
remedies such as injunctive relief or rescission. 

Our
Certificate of Incorporation provides that we are authorized to indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted
by Delaware law. Our Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that we are required to indemnify our directors and executive officers to the
fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Our Amended and Restated Bylaws also provide that, upon satisfaction of certain conditions,
we are required to advance expenses incurred by a director or executive officer in advance of the final disposition of any action or
proceeding, and permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director, employee or other agent for any liability arising out
of his or her actions in that capacity regardless of whether we would otherwise be permitted to indemnify him or her under the provisions
of Delaware law. Our Amended and Restated Bylaws also provide our Board of Directors with discretion to indemnify our other officers
and employees when determined appropriate by our Board of Directors. We have entered into agreements to indemnify our directors, executive
officers and other employees as determined by the Board of Directors. With certain exceptions, these agreements provide for indemnification
for related expenses, including, among other things, attorneys fees, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of
these individuals in any action or proceeding. We believe that these provisions and agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified
persons as directors and officers. We have obtained customary directors and officers liability insurance. 

- 82 - 

The
limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws may discourage
stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. They may also reduce the likelihood of
derivative litigation against our directors and officers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit us and other stockholders.
Furthermore, a stockholder s investment may be adversely affected to the extent that we pay the costs of settlement and damage
awards against directors and officers as required by these indemnification provisions. At present, there is no pending litigation or
proceeding involving any of our directors, officers or employees for which indemnification is sought, and we are not aware of any threatened
litigation that may result in claims for indemnification. 

Compliance
with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as Amended 

Section
16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires the Company s directors and executive officers and persons who
own more than 10 of a registered class of the Company s equity securities to file various reports with the Securities and Exchange
Commission concerning their holdings of, and transactions in, securities of the Company. Copies of these filings must be furnished to
the Company. 

To
the Company s knowledge, based solely on its review of the copies of the Section 16(a) reports furnished to the Company and any
written representations to the Company, that no other reports were required, the Company believes that all individual filing requirements
applicable to a director, officer, or beneficial owner of more than 10 of the Company s common stock were complied with under
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act during the year ended December 31, 202s, except as follows: Bas van der Baan was late in filing his
Form 3 in connection with his appointment to the Board of Directors on June 17, 2022.

as well as to extend the exercise date of previously issued, fully-vested stock options for 666,667 shares of common stock, exercisable
at 3.00 per share, from January 28, 2019 to January 28, 2024. 

Mr.

by Mr. Schwartzberg are contractually scheduled to expire one year from the date that his service on the Company s Board of Directors
terminated. 

Board
of Directors Compensation 

Effective
January 6, 2021, in recognition of their service as directors of the Company over the past year, the Company granted stock options to
purchase 50,000 shares of common stock to each of Dr. Winson Sze Chun Ho, Dr. Yun Yen, Dr. Stephen Forman, and Dr. Philip Palmedo (an
aggregate of 200,000 shares), which were fully vested upon issuance and exercisable for a period of five years at 3.21 per share, which
was the approximate fair market value of the Company s common stock on such date. The fair value of these stock options, as calculated
pursuant to the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, was determined to be 571,312 2.8566 per share) and was charged to general and
administrative costs in the consolidated statement of operations on the grant date. 

On
April 9, 2021, Winson Sze Chun Ho resigned from the Company s Board of Directors to focus on clinical and pre-clinical cancer research
in academic medicine. Concurrent with his resignation, the Board of Directors appointed Gil Schwartzberg to fill the vacancy created
by Dr. Ho s resignation. In connection with his appointment to the Board of Directors, and in accordance with the Company s
cash and equity compensation package for members of the Board of Directors, Mr. Schwartzberg was granted stock options to purchase 250,000
shares of the Company s common stock, exercisable for a period of five years at an exercise price of 3.20 per share (the closing
market price on the grant date), vesting 50 on the grant date and the remainder vesting 12.5 on the last day of each subsequent calendar
quarter-end until fully vested, subject to continued service. The fair value of these stock options, as calculated pursuant to the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model, was determined to be 753,611 3.0144 per share), of which 376,800 was attributable to the portion of the stock
options fully vested on April 9, 2021 and was therefore charged to operations on that date. The remaining unvested portion of the fair
value of the stock options was being charged to operations ratably from April 9, 2021 through June 30, 2023, although vesting terminated

2020
Stock Incentive Plan 

Summary 

On
July 14, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the 2020 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2020 Plan ), which was subsequently
approved by the stockholders of the Company. The 2020 Plan provides for the granting of equity-based awards, consisting of stock options,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, and other stock-based awards to employees, officers, directors and
consultants of the Company and its affiliates, initially for a total of 2,333,333 shares of the Company s common stock, under terms
and conditions as determined by the Company s Board of Directors. On October 7, 2022, the stockholders of the Company approved
an amendment to the 2020 Plan to increase the number of common shares issuable thereunder by 1,800,000 shares, to a total of 4,133,333
shares. 

As
of December 31, 2022, unexpired stock options for 2,603,125 shares were issued and outstanding under the 2020 Plan and 1,530,208 shares
were available for issuance under the 2020 Plan. 

Having
an adequate number of shares available for future equity compensation grants is necessary to promote our long-term success and the creation
of stockholder value by: 

Enabling us to continue
 to attract and retain the services of key service providers who would be eligible to receive grants; 

Aligning participants 
 interests with stockholders interests through incentives that are based upon the performance of our common stock; 

Motivating participants,
 through equity incentive awards, to achieve long-term growth in our business, in addition to short-term financial performance; and 

Providing a long-term equity
 incentive program that is competitive as compared to other companies with whom we compete for talent. 

- 89 - 

The
2020 Plan permits the discretionary award of incentive stock options ISOs ), non-statutory stock options NQSOs ),
restricted stock, restricted stock units RSUs ), stock appreciation rights SARs ), other equity awards and/or
cash awards to selected participants. The 2020 Plan will remain in effect until July 14, 2030. 

The
2020 Plan provides for the reservation of 4,133,333 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder (the Share Limit ), and
provides that the maximum number of shares that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of ISOs is 4,133,333 (the ISO Limit ). 

Key
Features of the 2020 Plan 

Certain
key features of the 2020 Plan are summarized as follows: 

If not terminated earlier
 by our Board of Directors, the 2020 Plan will terminate on July 14, 2030. 

Up to a maximum aggregate
 of 4,133,333 shares of common stock may be issued under the 2020 Plan. The maximum number of shares that may be issued pursuant to
 the exercise of ISOs is also 4,133,333. 

The 2020 Plan is administered
 by the Compensation Committee, which is comprised solely of independent members of our Board of Directors. The Board of Directors
 may designate a separate committee to make awards to employees who are not officers subject to the reporting requirements of Section
 16 of the Exchange Act. 

Employees, consultants
 and board members are eligible to receive awards, provided that the Compensation Committee has the discretion to determine (i) who
 shall receive any awards, and (ii) the terms and conditions of such awards. 

Awards may consist of ISOs,
 NQSOs, restricted stock, RSUs, SARs, other equity awards and/or cash awards. 

Stock options and SARs
 may not be granted at a per share exercise price below the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of grant. 

Stock options and SARs
 may not be repriced or exchanged without stockholder approval. 

The maximum exercisable
 term of stock options and SARs may not exceed ten years. 

Awards are subject to recoupment
 of compensation policies adopted by us. 

Eligibility
to Receive Awards . Employees, consultants and members of our Board of Directors are eligible to receive awards under the 2020
Plan. The Compensation Committee determines, in its discretion, the selected participants who will be granted awards under the 2020 Plan. 

Shares
Subject to the 2020 Plan . The maximum number of shares of common stock that can be issued under the 2020 Plan is 4,133,333 shares. 

The
shares underlying forfeited or terminated awards (without payment of consideration), or unexercised awards become available again for
issuance under the 2020 Plan. No fractional shares may be issued under the 2020 Plan. No shares will be issued with respect to a participant s
award unless applicable tax withholding obligations have been satisfied by the participant. 

- 90 - 

Administration
of the 2020 Plan . The 2020 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which consists of independent
board members. With respect to certain awards issued under the 2020 Plan, the members of the Compensation Committee also must be Non-Employee
Directors under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act. Subject to the terms of the 2020 Plan, the Compensation Committee has the sole
discretion, among other things, to: 

Select the individuals
 who will receive awards; 

Determine the terms and
 conditions of awards (for example, performance conditions, if any, and vesting schedule); 

Correct any defect, supply
 any omission, or reconcile any inconsistency in the 2020 Plan or any award agreement; 

Accelerate the vesting,
 extend the post-termination exercise term or waive restrictions of any awards at any time and under such terms and conditions as
 it deems appropriate, subject to the limitations set forth in the 2020 Plan; 

Permit a participant to
 defer compensation to be provided by an award; and 

Interpret the provisions
 of the 2020 Plan and outstanding awards. 

The
Compensation Committee may suspend vesting, settlement, or exercise of awards pending a determination of whether a selected participant s
service should be terminated for cause (in which case outstanding awards would be forfeited). Awards may be subject to any policy that
the Board of Directors may implement on the recoupment of compensation (referred to as a clawback policy). The members
of the Board of Directors, the Compensation Committee and their delegates shall be indemnified by us to the maximum extent permitted
by applicable law for actions taken or not taken regarding the 2020 Plan. 

Types
of Awards . 

Stock
Options . A stock option is the right to acquire shares at a fixed exercise price over a fixed period of time. The Compensation
Committee determines, among other terms and conditions, the number of shares covered by each stock option and the exercise price of the
shares subject to each stock option, but such per share exercise price cannot be less than the fair market value of a share of our common
stock on the date of grant of the stock option. The exercise price of each stock option granted under the 2020 Plan must be paid in full
at the time of exercise, either with cash, or through a broker-assisted cashless exercise and sale program, or net exercise,
or through another method approved by the Compensation Committee. Stock options granted under the 2020 Plan may be either ISOs or NQSOs.
In order to comply with Treasury Regulation Section 1.422-2(b), the 2020 Plan provides that no more than 4,133,333 shares may be issued
pursuant to the exercise of ISOs. 

SARs .
A SAR is the right to receive, upon exercise, an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares on the date
of the SAR s exercise and the aggregate exercise price of the shares covered by the exercised portion of the SAR. The Compensation
Committee determines the terms of SARs, including the exercise price (provided that such per share exercise price cannot be less than
the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of grant), the vesting and the term of the SAR. Settlement of a SAR
may be in shares of common stock or in cash, or any combination thereof, as the Compensation Committee may determine. SARs may not be
repriced or exchanged without stockholder approval. 

Restricted
Stock . A restricted stock award is the grant of shares of our common stock to a selected participant and such shares may be subject
to a substantial risk of forfeiture until specific conditions or goals are met. The restricted shares may be issued with or without cash
consideration being paid by the selected participant as determined by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee also will
determine any other terms and conditions of an award of restricted stock. 

- 91 - 

RSUs .
RSUs are the right to receive an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares covered by the RSU at some future date after the
grant. The Compensation Committee will determine all of the terms and conditions of an award of RSUs. Payment for vested RSUs may be
in shares of common stock or in cash, or any combination thereof, as the Compensation Committee may determine. RSUs represent an unfunded
and unsecured obligation for us, and a holder of a stock unit has no rights other than those of a general creditor. 

Other
Awards . The 2020 Plan also provides that other equity awards, which derive their value from the value of our shares or from increases
in the value of our shares, may be granted. In addition, cash awards may also be issued. Substitute awards may be issued under the 2020
Plan in assumption of or substitution for or exchange for awards previously granted by an entity which we may acquire. 

Limited
Transferability of Awards . Awards granted under the 2020 Plan generally are not transferrable other than by will or by the laws
of descent and distribution. However, the Compensation Committee may in its discretion permit the transfer of awards other than ISOs. 

Change
in Control . In the event that we are a party to a merger or other reorganization or similar transaction, outstanding 2020 Plan
awards will be subject to the agreement pertaining to such merger or reorganization. Such agreement may provide for (i) the continuation
of the outstanding awards by us if we are a surviving corporation, (ii) the assumption or substitution of the outstanding awards by the
surviving entity or its parent, (iii) full exercisability and/or full vesting of outstanding awards, or (iv) cancellation of outstanding
awards either with or without consideration, in all cases with or without consent of the selected participant. The Compensation Committee
will decide the effect of a change in control of us on outstanding awards. 

Amendment
and Termination of the 2020 Plan . The Board of Directors generally may amend or terminate the 2020 Plan at any time and for any
reason, except that it must obtain stockholder approval of material amendments to the extent required by applicable laws, regulations
or rules. 

ITEM
12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS 

The
table set forth below presents certain information regarding beneficial ownership of our common stock (the only class of our voting equity
securities issued and outstanding) as of March 10, 2023 by (i) each person or entity who is known by us to own beneficially more than
5 of our outstanding shares of common stock, (ii) each of our directors, and (iii) all of our directors and executive officers as a
group. As of March 10, 2023, there were 16,659,093 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. In computing the number and percentage
of shares beneficially owned by a person, shares of common stock that a person has a right to acquire within sixty (60) days of March
10, 2023 pursuant to stock options, warrants, convertible preferred stock or other rights are counted as outstanding, while these shares
are not counted as outstanding for computing the percentage ownership of any other person. This table is based upon information supplied
by our directors, officers and principal stockholders and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as noted,
the Company s executive office is reflected as the address of all officers, directors and other stockholders owning more than 5 .

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Stockholders and Board of Directors 

 Lixte
Biotechnology Holdings, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lixte Biotechnology Holdings, Inc. and subsidiary (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for
the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has no recurring source of revenue and has experienced negative operating
cash flows since inception. The Company has financed its working capital requirements through the recurring sale of its equity securities.
These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard
to these matters are also described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. These consolidated financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the SEC and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter Description 

The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that
was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material
to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical
audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating
the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which
it relates. 

F- 2 

Valuation
of Stock-Based Compensation 

As
discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized 1,546,040 of compensation expense to certain officers,
employees and consultants related to stock-based awards. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation for all stock-based awards
made to officers, employees and consultants based on estimated fair values. 

We
identified the valuation of stock-based compensation as a critical audit matter because of the subjectivity of the inputs and assumptions
that management utilized in determining the fair value of the stock-based awards. This required a high degree of effort and judgement
in selecting auditor procedures to evaluate management s estimates and assumptions as it relates to the determination of the fair
values of stock-based compensation. 

Our
audit procedures related to the of the stock-based awards, including the valuation methodology and related assumptions such as the risk-free
interest rate, volatility, and dividend yield, consisted of the following, among others: 

We
 obtained and read the stock-based award agreements, evaluated the reasonableness of management s significant valuation assumptions,
 and tested the mathematical accuracy of managements valuation analyses. 

We
 developed independent estimates for the fair values of the stock-based awards. 

We
have served as the Company s auditor since 2008.

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Years
Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 

In
order to achieve compliance with the minimum closing bid price per share requirement, the Company intends to file a proxy statement to
hold a special meeting of stockholders to seek approval to effect a reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of common
stock. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in this regard and will be able to regain compliance with
the minimum closing bid price requirement by June 19, 2023, in which case the Company anticipates Nasdaq would provide a notice to the
Company that its shares of common stock and warrants are subject to delisting, and the Company s common shares and warrants would
then be delisted. 

Going
Concern 

At
December 31, 2022, the Company had cash of available to fund its operations. Because the Company is currently engaged in Phase
2 clinical trials, it is expected that it will take a significant amount of time and resources to develop any product or intellectual
property capable of generating sustainable revenues. Accordingly, the Company s business is unlikely to generate any sustainable
operating revenues in the next several years and may never do so. Even if the Company is able to generate revenues through licensing
its technology, product sales or other commercial activities, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve and
maintain positive earnings and operating cash flows. 

The
Company s consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has no recurring source of revenue
and has experienced negative operating cash flows since inception. The Company has financed its working capital requirements through
the recurring sale of its equity securities. 

As
a result, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company s consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional equity capital to fund its research
and development activities and to ultimately achieve sustainable operating revenues and profitability. The amount and timing of future
cash requirements depends on the pace, design and results of the Company s clinical trial program, which, in turn, depends on the
availability of operating capital to fund such activities. 

Based
on current operating plans, the Company estimates that existing cash resources will provide sufficient working capital to fund the current
clinical trial program with respect to the development of the Company s lead anti-cancer clinical compound LB-100 through approximately
December 31, 2023. However, existing cash resources will not be sufficient to complete the development of and obtain regulatory approval
for the Company s product candidate, as a result of which the Company will need to raise significant additional capital to do so.
The Company estimates that it will need to raise additional capital to fund its operations, including its various clinical trial commitments,
during the latter part of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023. In addition, the Company s operating plans may change as a
result of many factors that are currently unknown and/or outside of the control of the Company, and additional funds may be needed sooner
than planned. 

As
market conditions present uncertainty as to the Company s ability to secure additional funds, there can be no assurance that the
Company will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms, as and when necessary, to continue to conduct operations. 

If
cash resources are insufficient to satisfy the Company s ongoing cash requirements, the Company would be required to scale back
or discontinue its clinical trial program, as well as its licensing and patent prosecution efforts and its technology and product development
efforts, or obtain funds, if available, through strategic alliances or joint ventures that could require the Company to relinquish rights
to and/or control of LB-100, or to discontinue operations entirely. 

Reverse
Stock Split 

On
November 18, 2020, the Company effected a reverse split of its outstanding shares of common stock. No fractional shares were
issued in connection with the reverse split, with any fractional shares resulting from the reverse split being rounded up to the nearest
whole share. 

All
share and per share amounts and information presented herein has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split for all
periods presented. 

and , respectively. Morgan Stanley
Wealth Management also maintains supplemental insurance coverage for the cash balances of its customers. The Company has not experienced
any losses to date resulting from this policy. 

and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Patent and licensing legal
and filing fees and costs are included in general and administrative costs in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. 

or more of general and administrative costs or research and development costs for the years ended December 31, 2022
and 2021 are described as follows. 

General
and administrative costs for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 included charges from legal firms and other vendors for general
licensing and patent prosecution costs relating to the Company s intellectual properties representing and of total
general and administrative costs, respectively. General and administrative costs for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 also
included charges for the fair value of stock options granted to directors and corporate officers representing and , respectively,
of total general and administrative costs. 

Research
and development costs for the year ended December 30, 2022 included charges from four vendors and consultants representing , ,
 and , respectively, of total research and development costs. Research and development costs for the year ended December 31,
2021 included charges from three vendors and consultants representing , and , respectively. 

unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022 or 2021
and does not anticipate any material amount of unrecognized tax benefits through December 31, 2023. 

The
Company accounts for uncertainties in income tax law under a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement,
presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns as prescribed by GAAP. The
tax effects of a position are recognized only if it is more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the taxing authority as
of the reporting date. If the tax position is not considered more-likely-than-not to be sustained, then no benefits of
the position are recognized. The Company had not recorded any liability for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022 or 2021.
Subsequent to December 31, 2022, any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be recognized as a component of income
tax expense. 

The
Company recognizes the fair value of stock-based compensation awards in general and administrative costs and in research and development
costs, as appropriate, in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. The Company issues new shares of common stock to
satisfy stock option exercises.

The

Company s expectation of dividend payouts and is assumed to be zero. The estimated volatility is based on the historical volatility
of the Company s common stock, calculated utilizing a look-back period approximately equal to the contractual life of the stock
option being granted. Unless sufficient historical exercise data is available, the expected life of the stock option is calculated as
the mid-point between the vesting period and the contractual term (the simplified method ). The fair market value of the
common stock is determined by reference to the quoted market price of the common stock on the grant date.

Net deferred tax assets 

In
assessing the potential realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion
or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company attaining
future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, management
was unable to determine if it is more likely than not that the Company s deferred tax assets will be realized and has therefore
recorded an appropriate valuation allowance against deferred tax assets at such dates. 

federal tax provision has been provided for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 due to the losses incurred during such periods.

period. The utilization of federal net operating loss carryforwards is subject to various limitations. 

The
state net operating loss carryovers include approximately that were incurred in the State of New York. New York tax law requires
New York net operating loss carryovers from years prior to 2015 to be converted, by applying a formula, into a Prior Net Operating Loss
Conversion (PNOLC) subtraction pool. , each year. Unutilized
PNOLC amounts carry forward to succeeding years until they expire in 2035. In addition, the full New York net operating losses incurred
in post-2015 tax years may be utilized in future tax years. Post-2015 New York net operating losses expire through 2040 . The state net
operating loss carryovers also include approximately that was incurred in the State of California. 

In
addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and certain corresponding provisions of state law, if a
corporation undergoes an ownership change, which is generally defined as a greater than 50 change, by value, in the ownership
of its equity over a three-year period, the corporation s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change
tax attributes to offset its post-change income might be limited. 

As
the Company s net operating losses have yet to be utilized, all previous tax years since 2006 remain subject to adjustment by Federal
authorities and other jurisdictions in which the Company currently operates or has operated in the past.

The Company s ability to conduct and fund these contractual commitments is subject to the timely availability of sufficient capital
to fund such expenditures, as well as any changes in the allocation or reallocation of such funds to the Company s current or future
clinical trial programs. The Company expects that the full amount of these expenditures will be incurred only if such clinical trial
programs are conducted as originally designed and their respective enrollments and duration are not modified or reduced. Clinical trial
programs, such as the types that the Company is engaged in, can be highly variable and can frequently involve a series of changes and
modifications over time as clinical data is obtained and analyzed, and are frequently modified, suspended or terminated before the clinical
trial endpoint. Accordingly, such contractual commitments as discussed herein should be considered as estimates only based on current
clinical assumptions and conditions, and are typically subject to significant revisions over time. 

Moffitt.
 Effective August 20, 2018, the Company entered into a Clinical Trial Research Agreement with the Moffitt Cancer Center and Research
Institute Hospital Inc., Tampa, Florida, effective for a term of five years, unless terminated earlier by the Company pursuant to 30
days written notice. Pursuant to the Clinical Trial Research Agreement, Moffitt agreed to conduct and manage a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial
to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of the Company s lead anti-cancer clinical compound LB-100 to be administered intravenously
in patients with low or intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). 

In
November 2018, the Company received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its Investigational New Drug Application IND to conduct a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of LB-100 in patients with low and intermediate-1
risk MDS who have failed or are intolerant of standard treatment. Patients with MDS, although usually older, are generally well except
for severe anemia requiring frequent blood transfusions. This Phase 1b/2 clinical trial utilizes LB-100 as a single agent in the treatment
of patients with low and intermediate-1 risk MDS, including patients with del(5q) myelodysplastic syndrome (del5qMDS) failing first line
therapy. The bone marrow cells of patients with del5qMDS are deficient in PP2A by virtue of an acquired mutation and are especially vulnerable
to further inhibition of PP2A by LB-100. The clinical trial began at a single site in April 2019 and the first patient was entered into
the clinical trial in July 2019. A total enrollment of 41 patients is planned. An interim analysis will be done after the first 21 patients
are entered. If there are 3 or more responders but fewer than 7, an additional 20 patients will be entered. If at any point there are
7 or more responders, this will be sufficient evidence to support continued development of LB-100 for the treatment of low and intermediate-1
risk MDS. Recruitment has been slow and the Covid-19 pandemic has further reduced recruitment of patients into the protocol. At the current
rate of accrual, the clinical trial is expected to be completed by June 30, 2025. However, with additional funds, the Company would consider
adding two additional MDS centers to the Phase 2 portion of the study to accelerate patient accrual. 

During
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred costs of and , respectively, pursuant to this agreement,
which have been included in research and development costs in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. As of December
31, 2022, total costs of have been incurred pursuant to this agreement. as of December 31, 2022, which is expected to be
incurred through December 31, 2025 . 

GEIS.
 Effective July 31, 2019, the Company entered into a Collaboration Agreement for an Investigator-Initiated Clinical Trial with the
Spanish Sarcoma Group (Grupo Espa ol de Investigaci n en Sarcomas or GEIS ), Madrid, Spain, to carry out a
study entitled Randomized phase I/II trial of LB-100 plus doxorubicin vs. doxorubicin alone in first line of advanced soft tissue
sarcoma . The purpose of this clinical trial is to obtain information with respect to the efficacy and safety of LB-100 combined
with doxorubicin in soft tissue sarcomas. Doxorubicin is the global standard for initial treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcomas ASTS ).
Doxorubicin alone has been the mainstay of first line treatment of ASTS for over 40 years, with little therapeutic gain from adding cytotoxic
compounds to or substituting other cytotoxic compounds for doxorubicin. In animal models, LB-100 consistently enhances the anti-tumor
activity of doxorubicin without apparent increases in toxicity. 

GEIS
has a network of referral centers in Spain and across Europe that have an impressive track record of efficiently conducting innovative
studies in ASTS. The Company agreed to provide GEIS with a supply of LB-100 to be utilized in the conduct of this clinical trial, as
well as to provide funding for the clinical trial. The goal is to enter approximately 150 patients in this clinical trial over a period
of two years. As advanced sarcoma is a very aggressive disease, the design of the study assumes a median progression free survival (PFS,
no evidence of disease progression or death from any cause) of 4.5 months in the doxorubicin arm and an alternative median PFS of 7.5
months in the doxorubicin plus LB-100 arm to demonstrate a statistically significant decrease in relative risk of progression or death
by adding LB-100. There is a planned interim analysis of the primary endpoint when approximately 50 of the 102 events required for final
analysis is reached. 

The
Company had previously expected that this clinical trial would commence during the quarter ended June 30, 2020. However, during July
2020, the Spanish regulatory authority advised the Company that although it had approved the scientific and ethical basis of the protocol,
it required that the Company manufacture new inventory of LB-100 under current Spanish pharmaceutical manufacturing standards. These
standards were adopted subsequent to the production of the Company s existing LB-100 inventory. 

In
order to manufacture a new inventory supply of LB-100 for the GEIS clinical trial, the Company engaged a number of vendors to carry out
the multiple tasks needed to make and gain approval of a new clinical product for investigational study in Spain. These tasks included
the synthesis under good manufacturing practices (GMP) of the active pharmacologic ingredient (API), with documentation of each of the
steps involved by an independent auditor. The API was then transferred to a vendor that prepares the clinical drug product, also under
GMP conditions documented by an independent auditor. The clinical drug product was then sent to a vendor to test for purity and sterility,
provide appropriate labels, store the drug, and distribute the drug to the clinical centers for use in the clinical trials. A formal
application documenting all steps taken to prepare the clinical drug product for clinical use must be submitted to the appropriate regulatory
authorities for review and approval before being used in a clinical trial. 

As
of December 31, 2022, this program to provide new inventory of the clinical drug product for the Spanish Sarcoma Group study, and potentially
for subsequent multiple trials within the European Union, had cost . While the production of new inventory has been completed,
nominal amounts of trailing costs are expected to be incurred during the year ending December 31, 2023. 

On
October 13, 2022, the Company announced that the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Products (Agencia Espa ola de Medicamentos
y Productos Sanitarios or AEMPS had authorized a Phase 1b/randomized Phase 2 study of LB-100, the Company s lead
clinical compound, plus doxorubicin, versus doxorubicin alone, the global standard for initial treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcomas
(ASTS). Consequently, the GEIS clinical trial is currently scheduled to commence during the quarter ending June 30, 2023 and to be completed
by December 31, 2025. Up to 170 patents will be entered into the clinical trial. The Phase 1b section of the protocol is expected to
be completed by June 30, 2024, at which time the Company expects to have data on both response and toxicity from this portion of the
clinical trial. 

The
interim analysis of this clinical trial will be done before full accrual of patients is completed to determine whether the study has
the possibility of showing superiority of the combination of LB-100 plus doxorubicin compared to doxorubicin alone. A positive study
would have the potential to change the standard therapy for this disease after four decades of failure to improve the marginal benefit
of doxorubicin alone. 

The
Company s agreement with GEIS provides for various payments based on achieving specific milestones over the term of the agreement.
Through December 31, 2022, the Company has paid GEIS an aggregate of for work done under this agreement through the third milestone. 

During
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred costs of and , respectively, pursuant to this agreement,
which have been included in research and development costs in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. As of December
31, 2022, total costs of have been incurred pursuant to this agreement. The Company s aggregate commitment pursuant to
this agreement, less amounts previously paid to date, totaled approximately as of December 31, 2022, which is expected to
be incurred through December 31, 2025. As the work is being conducted in Europe and is paid for in Euros, final costs are subject to
foreign currency fluctuations between the United States Dollar and the Euro. Such fluctuations are recorded in the consolidated statements
of operations as foreign currency gain or loss, as appropriate. 

City
of Hope. Effective January 18, 2021, the Company executed a Clinical Research Support Agreement with the City of Hope National Medical
Center, an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, and City of Hope Medical Foundation (collectively, City of Hope ),
to carry out a Phase 1b clinical trial of LB-100, the Company s first-in-class protein phosphatase inhibitor, combined with a standard
regimen for treatment of untreated extensive- stage disease small cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC). LB-100 will be given in combination with
carboplatin, etoposide and atezolizumab, an FDA-approved but marginally effective regimen, to previously untreated ED-SCLC patients.
The dose of LB-100 will be escalated with the standard fixed doses of the 3-drug regimen to reach a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).
Patient entry will be expanded so that a total of 12 patients will be evaluable at the RP2D to confirm the safety of the LB-100 combination
and to look for potential therapeutic activity as assessed by objective response rate, duration of overall response, progression-free-survival
and overall survival. 

The
clinical trial was initiated on March 9, 2021, with patient accrual expected to take approximately two years to complete. However, as
patient accrual has been slower than expected, the Company is currently seeking to add two additional sites to increase the rate of patient
accrual, with at least one major site expected to be added by June 30, 2023. With the additional sites, the Company expects that this
clinical trial will be completed by December 31, 2024. Without the additional sites, the Company expects that this clinical trial will
be completed no sooner than December 31, 2025. 

Effective
March 6, 2023, Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI), Nashville, Tennessee, joined the City of Hope s ongoing Phase 1b clinical
trial to assess the combination of the Company s first-in-class protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor, LB-100, with a standard
regimen for previously untreated, extensive stage small cell lung cancer disease. SCRI, one of the largest community-based cancer trial
centers in the United States, is expected to expedite and expand the accrual of patients to this clinical trial, thus reducing the time
required to demonstrate the feasibility, tolerability and efficacy of adding LB-100 to the current standard treatment regimen. 

During
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred costs of and , respectively, pursuant to this agreement.
The Company s aggregate commitment pursuant to this agreement, less amounts previously paid to date, totaled approximately 
as of December 31, 2022, which is expected to be incurred through December 31, 2024, based upon a target of 42 enrollees. If a significant
number of patients fail during the dose-escalation process, an increase of up to 12 patients would likely be necessary, at an estimated
additional cost of approximately . 

The
Company currently expects that enrollment in this clinical trial will range from approximately 18 to 30 enrollees, with 24 enrollees
as the most likely number. Should fewer than 42 enrollees be required, the Company has agreed to compensate City of Hope on a per enrollee
basis. If a significant improvement in outcome is seen with the addition of LB-100, this would be an important advance in the treatment
of a very aggressive disease. 

National
Cancer Institute Pharmacologic Clinical Trial. In May 2019, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) initiated a glioblastoma (GBM) pharmacologic
clinical trial. This study is being conducted and funded by the NCI under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, with the
Company being required to provide the LB-100 clinical compound. 

Primary
malignant brain tumors (gliomas) are very challenging to treat. Radiation combined with the chemotherapeutic drug temozolomide has been
the mainstay of therapy of the most aggressive gliomas (glioblastoma multiforme or GBM) for decades, with some further benefit gained
by the addition of one or more anti-cancer drugs, but without major advances in overall survival for the majority of patients. In animal
models of GBM, the Company s novel protein phosphatase inhibitor, LB-100, has been found to enhance the effectiveness of radiation,
temozolomide chemotherapy treatments and immunotherapy, raising the possibility that LB-100 may improve outcomes of standard GBM treatment
in the clinic. Although LB-100 has proven safe in patients at doses associated with apparent anti-tumor activity against several human
cancers arising outside the brain, the ability of LB-100 to penetrate tumor tissue arising in the brain is not known. Unfortunately,
many drugs potentially useful for GBM treatment do not enter the brain in amounts necessary for anti-cancer action. 

The
NCI study is designed to determine the extent to which LB-100 enters recurrent malignant gliomas. Patients having surgery to remove one
or more tumors will receive one dose of LB-100 prior to surgery and have blood and tumor tissue analyzed to determine the amount of LB-100
present and to determine whether the cells in the tumors show the biochemical changes expected to be present if LB-100 reaches its molecular
target. As a result of the innovative design of the NCI study, data from a few patients should be sufficient to provide a sound rationale
for conducting a larger clinical trial to determine the effectiveness of adding LB-100 to the standard treatment regimen for GBMs. Five
patients have been entered and analysis of the blood and tissue will now proceed. If there is evidence in at least two of the patients
of penetration of LB 100 into tumor tissue, the study will be deemed as successful. The results of this study are expected during 2023.

ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which were included in research and development costs in the consolidated statements
of operations. 

BioPharmaWorks .
Effective September 14, 2015, the Company entered into a Collaboration Agreement with BioPharmaWorks, pursuant to which the Company engaged
BioPharmaWorks to perform certain services for the Company. Those services included, among other things, assisting the Company to commercialize
its products and strengthen its patent portfolio; identifying large pharmaceutical companies with a potential interest in the Company s
product pipeline; assisting in preparing technical presentations concerning the Company s products; consultation in drug discovery
and development; and identifying providers and overseeing tasks relating to clinical development of new compounds. 

BioPharmaWorks
was founded in 2015 by former Pfizer scientists with extensive multi-disciplinary research and development and drug development experience.
The Collaboration Agreement was for an initial term of two years and automatically renews for subsequent annual periods unless terminated
by a party not less than 60 days prior to the expiration of the applicable period. In connection with the Collaboration Agreement, the

Foundation
for Angelman Syndrome Therapy. Effective August 12, 2020, the Company entered into a Master Service Agreement with the Foundation
for Angelman Syndrome Therapy (FAST) to collaborate in supporting pre-clinical studies of the potential benefit of LB-100 in a mouse
model of Angelman Syndrome (AS) as reported in The Proceedings of The National Academy of Science (Wang et al, June 3, 2019). The pre-clinical
studies were to be conducted at The University of California - Davis under the direction of Dr. David Segal, an internationally recognized
leader in AS research. If the pre-clinical studies confirm that LB-100 reduces AS signs in rodent models, the Company has agreed to enter
into discussions with FAST with respect to possible collaborations to most efficiently assess the benefit of LB-100 in patients with
AS, which is a rare disease affecting an estimated one out of 12,000 to one out of 20,000 persons in the United States. The genetic cause
of AS, reduced function of a specific maternal gene called Ube3, has been understood for some time, but the molecular abnormality resulting
from the genetic lesion has now been shown to be increased concentrations of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a molecular target of the
Company s investigational compound, LB-100. The Company has agreed to provide FAST with a supply of LB-100 to be utilized in the
conduct of this study, which was initially expected to be completed within three years. Conditioned on FAST s completion of this
study, the Company has agreed to pay FAST five percent of all proceeds, as defined in the Master Service Agreement, received by
the Company, up to a maximum of , from the exploitation of the study results. 

The
research team at the University of California - Davis recently completed their pre-clinical study of the potential benefit of LB-100
in a mouse model of AS. The preliminary analysis indicates that the positive results previously reported by Chinese investigators were
not confirmed in the US model. The Company is currently awaiting input from FAST as to whether it intends to continue to pursue pre-clinical
studies of LB 100. To date, FAST has not indicated whether it desires to pursue further studies of LB-100, but in light of the failure
to confirm the Chinese study results, the Company does not plan to pursue further studies of AS. 

Netherlands
Cancer Institute . On October 8, 2021, the Company entered into a Development Collaboration Agreement with the Netherlands Cancer
Institute, Amsterdam (see Note 5), one of the world s leading comprehensive cancer centers, and Oncode Institute, Utrecht, a major
independent cancer research center, to identify the most promising drugs to be combined with LB-100, and potentially LB-100 analogues,
to be used to treat a range of cancers, as well as to identify the specific molecular mechanisms underlying the identified combinations.
The Company has agreed to fund the study and provide a sufficient supply of LB-100 to conduct the study. The study is expected to take
approximately two years to conduct. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred charges in the amount of
 and , respectively, with respect to this agreement, which amounts are included in research and development costs in the
Company s consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2022, total costs of have been incurred pursuant to
this agreement. The Company s aggregate commitment pursuant to this agreement, less amounts previously paid to date, totaled approximately
 as of December 31, 2022, which is expected to be incurred through June 30, 2025. As the work is being conducted in Europe and
is paid for in Euros, final costs are subject to foreign currency fluctuations between the United States Dollar and the Euro. 

MRI
Global. The Company has contracted with MRI Global for stability analysis, storage and distribution of LB-100 for clinical trials
in the United States. On June 10, 2022, the contract was amended to reflect a new total contract price of and an estimated completion
date of April 30, 2023. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred costs of and , respectively,
pursuant to this agreement. As of December 31, 2022, total costs of have been incurred pursuant to this agreement. The Company s
aggregate commitment pursuant to this agreement, less amounts previously paid to date, totaled approximately as of December 31,
2022. 

External
Risks Associated with the Company s Business Activities 

Covid-19
Virus . The global outbreak of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) in early 2020 led to disruptions in general economic activities throughout
the world as businesses and governments implemented broad actions to mitigate this public health crisis. The extent to which the coronavirus
pandemic may impact the Company s business activities and capital raising efforts will depend on future developments, which are
uncertain and cannot be predicted. The Company is continuing to monitor this situation and will adjust its current business plans to
the extent additional information and guidance become available. The coronavirus pandemic has also presented a challenge to medical facilities
worldwide. Although the Company s clinical trials are conducted on an outpatient basis, the coronavirus pandemic appears to have
caused some delays in the Company s clinical trials, but the impact of the coronavirus pandemic appears to be subsiding. 

Inflation
Risk. The Company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its operations to date, other than its impact on the
general economy. However, there is a risk that the Company s operating costs could become subject to inflationary and interest
rate pressures in the future, which would have the effect of increasing the Company s operating costs (including, specifically,
clinical trial costs), and which would put additional stress on the Company s working capital resources. 

Supply
Chain Issues. The Company does not currently expect that supply chain issues will have a significant impact on its business activities,
including its ongoing clinical trials. 

Potential
Recession. There are various indications that the United States economy may be entering a recessionary period. Although unclear at
this time, an economic recession would likely impact the general business environment and the capital markets, which could, in turn,
affect the Company. 

The
Company is continuing to monitor these matters and will adjust its current business and financing plans as more information and guidance
become available.

Insider
Trading Policy 

This
Insider Trading Policy provides the standards of Lixte Biotechnology Holdings, Inc. (the Company on trading and
causing the trading of the Company s securities or securities of other publicly-traded companies while in possession of confidential
information. This Policy is divided into two parts: Part I prohibits trading in certain circumstances and applies to all directors, officers
and employees of the Company; and Part II imposes special additional trading restrictions and applies to all directors and executive
officers of the Company, as well as to any additional persons that the Company s Compliance Officer (as defined in Part I, Section
3(c) below) may designate from time to time as being subject to this Policy for Covered Persons by delivering to such persons a written
notice of designation (collectively, Covered Persons ). 

One
of the principal purposes of the federal securities laws is to prohibit so-called insider trading. Simply stated, insider
trading occurs when a person uses material non-public information obtained through involvement with the Company to make decisions to
purchase, sell or otherwise trade the Company s securities or to provide that information to others outside the Company. The prohibitions
against insider trading apply to trades, tips and recommendations by virtually any person, including all persons associated with the
Company, if the information involved is material and non-public. These terms are defined in this Policy under
Part I, Section 3 below. The prohibitions would apply to any director, officer or employee who buys or sells Company stock on the basis
of material non-public information that he or she obtained about the Company, its customers, suppliers, licensors, licensees or other
companies with which the Company has contractual relationships or may be negotiating transactions. 

PART I 

1.
 Applicability 

This
Policy applies to all transactions in the Company s securities, including common stock, options and any other securities that the
Company may issue, such as preferred stock, notes, bonds and convertible securities, as well as to derivative securities relating to
any of the Company s securities, whether or not issued by the Company. 

This
Policy applies to all employees of the Company and its subsidiaries all officers of the Company and its subsidiaries and all members
of the Company s board of directors. The Compliance Officer has discretion to require a Company consultant or other service provider
to comply with this Policy and to treat such consultant or service provider as a Covered Person. 

2.
 General Policy: No Trading or Causing Trading While in Possession of Material Non-Public Information 

(a)
 No director, officer or employee may purchase or sell any Company security, whether or not issued by the Company, while in possession
of material non-public information about the Company. (The terms material and non-public are defined in Part
I, Sections 3(a) and 3(b) below.) 

(b)
 No director, officer or employee who knows of any material non-public information about the Company may communicate that information
to any other person, including family and friends. 

(c)
 In addition, no director, officer or employee may purchase or sell any security of any other company, whether or not issued by the
Company, while in possession of material non-public information about that company that was obtained in the course of his or her involvement
with the Company. No director, officer or employee who knows of any such material non-public information may communicate that information
to any other person, including family and friends. 

(d)
 For compliance purposes, you should never trade, tip or recommend securities (or otherwise cause the purchase or sale of securities)
while in possession of information that you have reason to believe is material and non-public unless you first consult with, and obtain
the advance approval of, the Compliance Officer or his or her designee. 

(e)
 Part I, Sections 2(a) and 2(d) above of this Policy do not apply to (1) the exercise of an employee stock option, (2) the exercise
of a tax withholding right pursuant to which you elect to have the Company withhold shares subject to an option to satisfy tax withholding
requirements, (3) the acquisition of securities from the Company pursuant to the Company s Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, or
(4) transactions pursuant to an Approved 10b5-1 Plan described in Part II, Section 1(c) below. This Policy does apply,
however, to any sale of the Company s securities acquired pursuant to the Company s Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, or
acquired upon exercise of an option, including a sale of Company securities as part of a broker-assisted cashless exercise of an option
and a sale of Company securities for the purpose of generating the cash needed to pay the exercise price of an option. 

2 

(f)
 Part II of this Policy discusses the requirement to pre-clear transactions in the Company s securities with the Compliance
Officer and to conduct transactions in the Company s securities only during window periods, subject to several specified exceptions. 

3.
 Definitions 

(a)
 Materiality . Insider trading restrictions come into play only if the information you possess is material. Materiality,
however, involves a relatively low threshold. Information is generally regarded as material if it has market significance,
that is, if its public dissemination is likely to affect the market price of securities, or if it otherwise is information that a reasonable
investor would want to know before making an investment decision. 

Information
dealing with the following subjects is reasonably likely to be found material in particular situations: 

results
 of the Company s research and development activities; 

negotiating,
 obtaining or losing important contracts; 

obtaining
 any patents or other intellectual property rights; 

significant
 write-downs in assets or increases in reserves; 

developments
 regarding significant litigation or government agency investigations; 

liquidity
 problems; 

changes
 in earnings estimates or unusual gains or losses in major operations; 

major
 changes in management; 

extraordinary
 borrowings; 

proposals,
 plans or agreements involving mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, recapitalizations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements,
 or purchases or sales of substantial assets; and 

public
 offerings of securities. 

3 

Material
information is not limited to historical facts but may also include projections and forecasts. With respect to a future event, such as
a merger, acquisition or introduction or approval of a new product, the point at which negotiations or product development is determined
to be material is determined by balancing the probability that the event will occur against the magnitude of the effect the event would
have on a company s operations or stock price should it occur. Thus, information concerning an event that would have a large effect
on stock price, such as a merger, may be material even if the possibility that the event will occur is relatively small. When in doubt
about whether particular non-public information is material, presume it is material. If you are unsure whether information is material,
you should consult the Compliance Officer before making any decision to disclose such information (other than to persons who need to
know it) or to trade in or recommend securities to which that information relates. 

(b)
 Non-Public Information . Insider trading prohibitions come into play only when you possess information that is material and
 non-public. The fact that information has been disclosed to a few members of the public does not make it public for insider
trading purposes. To be public the information must have been disseminated in a manner designed to reach investors generally,
and the investors must be given the opportunity to absorb the information. Even after public disclosure of information about the Company,
you must wait until the close of business on the second trading day after the information was publicly disclosed before you can treat
the information as public. 

Non-public
information may include: 

information
 available to a select group of analysts or brokers or institutional investors; 

undisclosed
 facts that are the subject of rumors, even if the rumors are widely circulated; and 

information
 that has been entrusted to the Company on a confidential basis until a public announcement of the information has been made and enough
 time has elapsed for the market to respond to a public announcement of the information (normally two days). 

As
with questions of materiality, if you are not sure whether information is considered public, you should either consult with the Compliance
Officer or assume that the information is non-public and treat it as confidential. 

(c)
 Compliance Officer . The Company has appointed the Chief Administrative Officer of the Company as the Compliance Officer for
this Policy. The Company may change the Compliance Officer from time to time. The primary duties of the Compliance Officer include the
following: 

assisting
 with implementation of this Policy; 

4 

circulating
 this Policy to all employees and ensuring that this Policy is amended as necessary to remain up-to-date with insider trading laws;
 and 

pre-clearing
 transactions in securities of the Company by Covered Persons in accordance with the procedures set forth in Part II, Section 3 below. 

4.
 Violations of Insider Trading Laws 

Penalties
for trading on or communicating material non-public information can be severe, both for individuals involved in such unlawful conduct
and their employers and supervisors, and may include jail terms, criminal fines, civil penalties and civil enforcement injunctions. Given
the severity of the potential penalties, compliance with this Policy is absolutely mandatory. 

(a)
 Legal Penalties . A person who violates insider trading laws by engaging in transactions in a company s securities when
he or she has material non-public information can be sentenced to a substantial jail term and required to pay a penalty of several times
the amount of profits gained or losses avoided. 

In
addition, a person who tips others may also be liable for transactions by the tippees to whom he or she has disclosed material non-public
information. Tippers can be subject to the same penalties and sanctions as the tippees, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
 SEC has imposed large penalties even when the tipper did not profit from the transaction. 

The
SEC can also seek substantial penalties from any person who, at the time of an insider trading violation, directly or indirectly
controlled the person who committed such violation, which would apply to the Company and/or management and supervisory personnel.
These control persons may be held liable for up to the greater of 1 million or three times the amount of the profits gained or losses
avoided. Even for violations that result in a small or no profit, the SEC can seek a minimum of 1 million from a company and/or management
and supervisory personnel as control persons. 

(b)
 Company-Imposed Penalties . Employees who violate this Policy may be subject to disciplinary action by the Company, including
dismissal for cause. Any exceptions to this Policy, if permitted, may be granted only by the Compliance Officer and must be provided
before any activity contrary to the above requirements takes place. 

5 

PART
 II 

1.
 Blackout Periods 

All
Covered Persons are prohibited from engaging in any transaction in the Company s securities during blackout periods, subject to
the exceptions described below. 

(a)
 Quarterly Blackout Periods . Transactions in the Company s securities are prohibited during the period beginning on the
last day of each fiscal quarter or fiscal year and ending two business days after public release of quarterly or annual financial results
for that fiscal period. During these periods, Covered Persons generally possess or are presumed to possess material non-public information
about the Company s financial results. 

(b)
 Other Blackout Periods . From time to time, other types of material non-public information regarding the Company (such as negotiation
of mergers, acquisitions or dispositions or new product developments) may be pending and not be publicly disclosed. While such material
non-public information is pending, the Company may impose special blackout periods during which Covered Persons are prohibited from trading
in the Company s securities. If the Company imposes a special blackout period, it will notify the Covered Persons affected. 

(c)
 Exceptions . Notwithstanding the foregoing, blackout period trading restrictions do not apply to (1) bona fide gifts or charitable
contributions as long as the Covered Person does not control the donee and does not give the donee material non-public information about
the Company, (2) the exercise of an employee stock option, (3) the exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which you elect to
have the Company withhold shares subject to an option to satisfy tax withholding requirements, or (4) the acquisition of securities from
the Company pursuant to the Company s Equity Incentive Plan, as amended. However, the sale of the securities described in clauses
(2), (3) and (4) of the preceding sentence is subject to the blackout period trading restrictions. Furthermore, blackout period trading
restrictions do not apply to transactions under a pre-existing written plan, contract, instruction, or arrangement under SEC Rule 10b5-1
(an Approved 10b5-1 Plan that: 

has
 been reviewed and approved at least one month in advance of any trades thereunder by the Compliance Officer (or, if revised or amended,
 such revisions or amendments have been reviewed and approved by the Compliance Officer at least one month in advance of any subsequent
 trades); 

was
 entered into in good faith by the Covered Person at a time when the Covered Person was not in possession of material non-public information
 about the Company; and 

gives
 a third party the discretionary authority to execute such purchases and sales, outside the control of the Covered Person, so long
 as such third party does not possess any material non-public information about the Company; or explicitly specifies the security
 or securities to be purchased or sold, the number of shares, the prices and/or dates of transactions, or other formula(s) describing
 such transactions. 

6 

2.
 Trading Windows 

Covered
Persons are permitted to trade in the Company s securities when no blackout period is in effect. However, even during this trading
window, a Covered Person who is in possession of any material non-public information about the Company should not trade in the Company s
securities, subject to the exceptions described in Part II, Section 1(c) above, until the information has been made publicly available
or is no longer material. In addition, the Company may close this trading window if a special blackout period under Part II, Section
1(b) above is imposed and will re-open the trading window once the special blackout period has ended. 

3.
 Pre-Clearance of Securities Transactions 

(a)
 Because Covered Persons are likely to obtain material non-public information on a regular basis, the Company requires all such persons
to refrain from engaging in transactions in the Company s securities, even during a trading window under Part II, Section 2 above,
without first pre-clearing with the Compliance Officer all transactions in the Company s securities, except as described below. 

(b)
 Subject to the exceptions described in subsection (d) below, no Covered Person may, directly or indirectly, purchase or sell (or
gift, pledge, loan, place in a margin account or otherwise transfer) any Company security at any time without obtaining prior approval
from the Compliance Officer. These procedures also apply to transactions by such person s spouse, other persons living in such
person s household and minor children and to transactions by entities over which such person exercises control. 

(c)
 The Compliance Officer shall record the date each request is received and the date and time each request is approved or disapproved.
Unless revoked or otherwise specified by the Compliance Officer, a grant of permission will normally remain valid until the close of
trading ten business days following the day on which it was granted. If the transaction does not occur during the approved period, pre-clearance
of the transaction must be re-requested. 

(d)
 Pre-clearance is not required for (1) the exercise of an employee stock option, (2) the exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant
to which you elect to have the Company withhold shares subject to an option to satisfy tax withholding requirements, or (3) the acquisition
of securities from the Company pursuant to the Company s Equity Incentive Plan, as amended. However, the sale of the securities
described in the preceding sentence does require pre-clearance from the Compliance Officer. Furthermore, pre-clearance is not required
for purchases and sales of securities under an Approved 10b5-1 Plan. With respect to any purchase or sale under an Approved 10b5-1 Plan,
the third party effecting transactions on behalf of the Covered Person should be instructed to send duplicate confirmations of all such
transactions to the Compliance Officer.
