CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This report contains forward-looking statements.
Except as required by law, we undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statement after the date of this report, either to conform
any statement to reflect actual results or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Our Company 

Conectisys
Corporation, a Colorado corporation Conectisys , the Company , we , us or our is a shell company seeking to create value for its shareholders by merging with another entity with experienced management and opportunities
for growth in return for shares of our Common Stock. 

No potential
merger candidate has been identified at this time. 

We do not
propose to restrict our search for a business opportunity to any particular industry or geographical area and may, therefore, engage in
essentially any business in any industry. We have unrestricted discretion in seeking and participating in a business opportunity, subject
to the availability of such opportunities, economic conditions, and other factors. 

The selection
of a business opportunity in which to participate is complex and risky. Additionally, we have only limited resources and may find it difficult
to locate good opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire any business opportunity which will
ultimately prove to be beneficial to us and our shareholders. We will select any potential business opportunity based on our management's
best business judgment. 

Our activities
are subject to several significant risks, which arise primarily as a result of the fact that we have no specific business, and may acquire
or participate in a business opportunity based on the decision of management, which potentially could act without the consent, vote, or
approval of our shareholders. The risks faced by us are further increased as a result of a lack of resources and our inability to provide
a prospective business opportunity with significant capital. 

Our History 

The Company
was incorporated in Colorado on February 2, 1986 under the name Coastal Financial Corp. On December 5, 1994, Coastal Financial Corp. changed
its name to BDR Industries, Inc., which changed its name on October 16, 1995, to ConectiSys Corporation. 

The Company
was engaged in the development of a low-cost automatic meter reading, or AMR Solution, until it ceased all business activity in 2008.

Revenue 

We have
had no revenues from fiscal year 2008 through the date of this filing. 

General
Business Plan 

Our business
plan to seek a merger has many uncertainties which pose risks to investors. 

1 

We
intend to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in business opportunities presented to us by persons
or firms which desire to seek the advantages of an issuer who has complied with the Securities Act of 1934 (the 1934 Act ).
We will not restrict our search to any specific business, industry or geographical location, and we may participate in business ventures
of virtually any nature. This discussion of our proposed business is purposefully general and is not meant to be restrictive of our unlimited
discretion to search for and enter into potential business opportunities. We anticipate that we may be able to participate in only one
potential business venture because of our lack of financial resources. We may seek a business opportunity with entities which have recently
commenced operations, or that desire to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand into new
products or markets, to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes. All of these activities have risk to investors
including dilution and management. 

We expect
that the selection of a business opportunity will be complex. Due to general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made
in some industries and shortages of available capital, we believe that there are numerous firms seeking the benefits of an issuer who
has complied with the 1934 Act. Such benefits may include facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may
be sought, providing liquidity for incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, providing liquidity (subject to restrictions
of applicable statutes) for all stockholders and other factors. Potentially, available business opportunities may occur in many different
industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business
opportunities extremely difficult and complex. We have, and will continue to have, essentially no assets to provide the owners of business
opportunities. However, we will be able to offer owners of acquisition candidates the opportunity to acquire a controlling ownership interest
in an issuer who has complied with the 1934 Act without incurring the cost and time required to conduct an initial public offering. 

The analysis
of new business opportunities will be undertaken by, or under the supervision of, our Board of Directors. We intend to concentrate on
identifying preliminary prospective business opportunities which may be brought to our attention through present associations of our director,
professional advisors or by our stockholders. In analyzing prospective business opportunities, we will consider such matters as (i) available
technical, financial and managerial resources; (ii) working capital and other financial requirements; (iii) history of operations, if
any, and prospects for the future; (iv) nature of present and expected competition; (v) quality, experience and depth of management services;
(vi) potential for further research, development or exploration; (vii) specific risk factors not now foreseeable but that may be anticipated
to impact the proposed activities of the company; (viii) potential for growth or expansion; (ix) potential for profit; (x) public recognition
and acceptance of products, services or trades; (xi) name identification; and (xii) other factors that we consider relevant. As part of
our investigation of the business opportunity, we expect to meet personally with management and key personnel. To the extent possible,
we intend to utilize written reports and personal investigation to evaluate the above factors. 

We will
not acquire or merge with any company for which audited financial statements cannot be obtained within a reasonable period of time after
closing of the proposed transaction. 

Acquisition
Interest 

In implementing
a structure for a particular business acquisition, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or
licensing agreement with another company or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. Upon consummation of
a transaction, it is probable that our present management and stockholders will no longer be in control of us. In addition, our sole director
may, as part of the terms of the acquisition transaction, resign and be replaced by new directors without a vote of our stockholders,
or sell his stock in us. Any such sale will only be made in compliance with the securities laws of the United States and any applicable
state. 

It is anticipated
that any securities issued in any such reorganization would be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration under application federal
and state securities laws. In some circumstances, as a negotiated element of the transaction, we may agree to register all or a part of
such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter. If such registration occurs, it will
be undertaken by the surviving entity after it has successfully consummated a merger or acquisition and is no longer considered an inactive
company. 

2 

The issuance
of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop in our securities may have a depressive
effect on the value of our securities in the future. There is no assurance that such a trading market will develop. 

While
the actual terms of a transaction cannot be predicted, it is expected that the parties to any business transaction on will find it desirable
to avoid the creation of a taxable event and thereby structure the business transaction in a so-called tax-free reorganization
under Sections 368(a)(1) or 351 of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code ). In order to obtain tax-free treatment under the
Code, it may be necessary for the owner of the acquired business to own 80 or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. In such
event, our stockholders would retain less than 20 of the issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This would result in
significant dilution in the equity of our stockholders. 

As part
of our investigation, we expect to meet personally with management and key personnel, visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent
analysis of verification of certain information provided, check references of management and key personnel, and take other reasonable
investigative measures, to the extent of our limited financial resources and management expertise. The manner in which we participate
in an opportunity will depend on the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of both parties, and the management of
the opportunity. 

With respect
to any merger or acquisition, and depending upon, among other things, the target company s assets and liabilities, our stockholders
will in all likelihood hold a substantially lesser percentage ownership interest in us following any merger or acquisition. The percentage
ownership may be subject to significant reduction in the event we acquire a target company with assets and expectations of growth. Any
merger or acquisition can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by our stockholders. 

We will
participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate written business agreements. Although the
terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally we anticipate that such agreements will (i) require specific representations and
warranties by all of the parties; (ii) specify certain events of default; (iii) detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must
be satisfied by each of the parties prior to and after such closing; (iv) outline the manner of bearing costs, including costs associated
with the Company s attorneys and accountants; (v) set forth remedies on defaults; and (vi) include miscellaneous other terms. 

As stated
above, we will not acquire or merge with any entity which cannot provide independent audited financial statements within a reasonable
period of time after closing of the proposed transaction. If such audited financial statements are not available at closing, or within
time parameters necessary to insure our compliance within the requirements of the 1934 Act, or if the audited financial statements provided
do not conform to the representations made by that business to be acquired, the definitive closing documents will provide that the proposed
transaction will be voidable, at the discretion of our present management. If such transaction is voided, the definitive closing documents
will also contain a provision providing for reimbursement for our costs associated with the proposed transaction. 

Competition 

We believe
we are an insignificant participant among the firms which engage in the acquisition of business opportunities. There are many established
venture capital and financial concerns that have significantly greater financial and personnel resources and technical expertise than
we have. In view of our limited financial resources and limited management availability, we will continue to be at a significant competitive
disadvantage compared to our competitors. 

Intellectual
Property 

We own no
intellectual property. 

3 

Employees 

We presently
have no full time executive, operational, or clerical staff. Mr. Cacciamatta has been the sole director and sole officer of the Company
since August 1, 2020. 

Factors Affecting
Future Performance 

Rather than
an operating business, our goal is to obtain debt and/or equity financing to meet our ongoing operating expenses and attempt to merge
with another entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our Common Stock to create value
for our shareholders. 

Although
there is no assurance that this series of events will be successfully completed, we believe we can successfully complete an acquisition
or merger which will enable us to continue as a going concern. Any acquisition or merger will most likely be dilutive to our existing
stockholders. 

The factors
affecting our future performance are listed and explained below under the section Risk Factors . 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

There are
various risks associated with our business, including the risks discussed below. You should carefully consider these risk factors, as
well as the other information contained in this Registration Statement, in evaluating our business and us. 

Rather than
our previous operating business, our business is now to seek to raise the debt and/or equity to meet our ongoing operating expenses and
attempt to merge with another entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our Common Stock
to create value for our shareholders. There can be no assurance that this series of events will be successfully completed or that any
stockholder will realize any return on their shares after the new business plan has been implemented. 

RISKS
RELATED TO OUR COMPANY 

WE HAVE
INCURRED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES AND ANTICIPATE FUTURE LOSSES 

As of December
31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of 32,289,547 and a stockholders deficit of 43,106. 

Future losses
are likely to occur until we are able to merge with another entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return
for shares of our Common Stock to create value for our shareholders, as we have no sources of income to meet our operating expenses. 

OUR EXISTING
FINANCIAL RESOURCES ARE INSUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR ONGOING OPERATING EXPENSES 

We have
no sources of income at this time and no existing cash balances to meet our ongoing operating expenses. In the short term, unless we are
able to raise additional debt and/or equity we shall be unable to meet our ongoing operating expenses. On a longer-term basis, we intend
to raise the debt and/or equity to meet our ongoing operating expenses and merge with another entity with experienced management and opportunities
for growth in return for shares of our Common Stock to create value for our shareholders. There can be no assurance that this series of
events will be successfully completed. 

4 

WE INTEND TO PURSUE THE ACQUISITION OF AN OPERATING
BUSINESS 

Our sole strategy is to acquire an operating business.
Successful implementation of this strategy depends on our ability to identify a suitable acquisition candidate, acquire such company on
acceptable terms and integrate its operations. In pursuing acquisition opportunities, we compete with other companies with similar strategies.
Competition for acquisition targets may result in increased prices of acquisition targets and a diminished pool of companies available
for acquisition. Acquisitions involve a number of other risks, including risks of acquiring undisclosed or undesired liabilities, acquired
in-process technology, stock compensation expense, diversion of management attention, potential disputes with the seller of one or more
acquired entities and possible failure to retain key acquired personnel. Any acquired entity or assets may not perform relative to our
expectations. Our ability to meet these challenges has not been established. 

SCARCITY
OF, AND COMPETITION FOR, BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND COMBINATIONS 

We believe
we are an insignificant participant among the firms which engage in the acquisition of business opportunities. There are many established
venture capital and financial concerns that have significantly greater financial and personnel resources and technical expertise than
we have. Nearly all such entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than
us and, consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing
a business combination. Moreover, we will also compete in seeking merger or acquisition candidates with numerous other small public companies.
In view of our limited financial resources and limited management availability, we will continue to be at a significant competitive disadvantage
compared to our competitors. 

WE HAVE
NOT EXECUTED ANY FORMAL AGREEMENT FOR A BUSINESS COMBINATION OR OTHER TRANSACTION AND HAVE ESTABLISHED NO STANDARDS FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 

We have
not executed any formal arrangement, agreement or understanding with respect to engaging in a merger with, joint venture with or acquisition
of a private or public entity. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying and evaluating suitable business opportunities
or in concluding a business combination. We have not identified any particular industry or specific business within an industry for evaluation.
There is no assurance we will be able to negotiate a business combination on terms favorable, if at all. We have not established a specific
length of operating history or specified level of earnings, assets, net worth or other criteria which we will require a target business
opportunity to have achieved, and without which we would not consider a business combination. Accordingly, we may enter into a business
combination with a business opportunity having no significant operating history, losses, limited or no potential for earnings, limited
assets, negative net worth or other negative characteristics. 

WE MAY
BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY ADVERSE GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 

Current
conditions in domestic and global economies are extremely uncertain. Adverse changes may occur as a result of softening global economies,
wavering consumer confidence caused by the threat of terrorism and war, and other factors capable of affecting economic conditions. Such
changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

BECAUSE
OUR PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDER CONTROLS OUR ACTIVITIES, HE MAY CAUSE US TO ACT IN A MANNER THAT IS MOST BENEFICIAL TO HIMSELF AND NOT TO OTHER
SHAREHOLDERS WHICH COULD CAUSE US NOT TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT OUTSIDE INVESTORS MIGHT VIEW FAVORABLY 

Our principal
shareholder owns approximately 95 of our outstanding Common Stock. As a result, he effectively controls all matters requiring stockholder
approval, including the election of directors, the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers and related party transaction.
He may also have the ability to delay or perhaps even block, by his ownership of our stock, an unsolicited tender offer. This concentration
of ownership could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of our company that other shareholders might
view favorably. 

5 

OUR SOLE
DIRECTOR MAY HAVE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, WHICH MAY NOT BE RESOLVED FAVORABLY TO US. 

Certain
conflicts of interest may exist between our sole director and us. Our sole director has other business interests to which he devotes his
attention, and may be expected to continue to do so, although management time should be devoted to our business. As a result, conflicts
of interest may arise that can be resolved only through exercise of such judgment as is consistent with fiduciary duties to us. See Directors
and Executive Officers and Conflicts of Interest, below. 

WE MAY
DEPEND UPON OUTSIDE ADVISORS, WHO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON REASONABLE TERMS AND AS NEEDED. 

To supplement
the business experience of our officer and director, we may be required to employ accountants, technical experts, appraisers, attorneys,
or other consultants or advisors. Our Board, without any input from stockholders, will make the selection of any such advisors. Furthermore,
it is anticipated that such persons may be engaged on an as needed basis without a continuing fiduciary or other obligation
to us. In the event we consider it necessary to hire outside advisors, we may elect to hire persons who are affiliates, if they are able
to provide the required services. 

RISKS
RELATED TO OUR SECURITIES 

REDUCTION
OF PERCENTAGE SHARE OWNERSHIP FOLLOWING BUSINESS COMBINATION AND DILUTION TO STOCKHOLDERS 

Our primary
plan of operation is based upon a business combination with a private concern which, in all likelihood, would result in us issuing securities
to stockholders of such private company. The issuance of previously authorized and unissued shares of our Common Stock would result in
reduction in the percentage of shares owned by present and prospective stockholders and may result in a change in control or management.
In addition, any merger or acquisition can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of the shares held our
stockholders. 

THE REGULATION
OF PENNY STOCKS BY SEC AND FINRA MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE TRADABILITY OF OUR SECURITIES. 

Our securities
are currently listed on the OTC Pink Sheets and we plan to have them listed on the OCTQB. Our shares are subject to a Securities and Exchange
Commission rule that imposes special sales practice requirements upon broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established
customers or accredited investors. For purposes of the rule, the phrase accredited investors means, in general terms, institutions
with assets in excess of 5,000,000, or individuals having a net worth in excess of 1,000,000 or having an annual income that exceeds
 200,000 (or that, when combined with a spouse's income, exceeds 300,000). 

For transactions
covered by the rule, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written
agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, the rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities
and also may affect the ability of purchasers in this offering to sell their securities in any market that might develop. 

In addition,
the Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted a number of rules to regulate penny stocks. Such rules include Rules 3a51-1,
15g-1, 15g-2, 15g-3, 15g-4, 15g-5, 15g-6, 15g-7, and 15g-9 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Because our securities
constitute penny stocks within the meaning of the rules, the rules would apply to us and to our securities. The rules may
further affect the ability of our shareholders to sell our securities in any market that might develop for them. 

6 

Shareholders
should be aware that, according to Securities and Exchange Commission, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns
of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (i) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related
to the promoter or issuer; (ii) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press
releases; (iii) boiler room practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced
sales persons; (iv) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (v) the wholesale dumping
of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired amount of consequent investor losses.
Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a
position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines
of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities. 

The shares
of our Common Stock may be thinly traded on the OTC Pink Sheets, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our shares
of Common Stock at or near ask prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation is attributable to a number
of factors, including the fact that we are a small company which is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional
investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume. Even if we came to the attention of such persons,
they tend to be risk-averse and would be reluctant to follow an unproven, early stage company such as ours or purchase or recommend the
purchase of our shares of Common Stock until such time as we became more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, there may be periods of
several days or more when trading activity in our shares of Common Stock is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer
which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on securities
price. 

OUR COMMON
STOCK WILL IN ALL LIKELIHOOD BE THINLY TRADED AND, AS A RESULT, YOU MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL AT OR NEAR ASK PRICES OR AT ALL IF YOU NEED
TO LIQUIDATE YOUR SHARES. 

We cannot
give you any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our shares of Common Stock will develop or be sustained,
or that any trading levels will be sustained. Due to these conditions, we can give investors no assurance that they will be able to sell
their shares of Common Stock at or near ask prices or at all if you need money or otherwise desire to liquidate your shares of Common
Stock of our Company. 

THE COMPANY
IS A SHELL COMPANY AND AS SUCH SHAREHOLDERS CANNOT RELY ON THE PROVISIONS OF RULE 144 FOR RESALE OF THEIR SHARES UNTIL CERTAIN CONDITIONS
ARE MET. 

The Company
is a shell company as defined under Rule 405 of the Securities Act of 1933 as a registrant that has no or nominal operations and either
no or nominal assets, or assets consisting only of cash or cash equivalents and/or other nominal assets. As securities issued by a shell
company, the securities issued by the Company can only be resold by filing a registration statement for those shares or utilizing the
provisions of Rule 144 once certain conditions are met, as follows: (i) the Company has ceased to be a shell company, (ii) the Company
is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (iii) the Company has filed all
required reports under the Exchange Act for the preceding 12 months and (iv) one year has elapsed since the Company filed Form 10 
information. 

Thus, a
shareholder of the Company will not be able to sell its shares until such time as a registration statement for those shares is filed or
the Company has ceased to be a shell company either by effecting a business combination or by developmental growth, the Company has remained
current on its Exchange Act filings for 12 months and the Company has filed the information as would be required by a Form 10 
filing (e.g. audited financial statements, management information and compensation, shareholder information, etc.) 

THE PRICE
OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD BE HIGHLY VOLATILE 

Our intention
is for our shares of Common Stock to continue to be listed on the OTC Markets. There is a limited market for our stock. It may be subject
to volatility, low volumes of trades and large spreads in bid and ask prices quoted by market makers. Due to the low volume of shares
traded on any trading day, persons buying or selling in relatively small quantities may easily influence prices of our Common Stock.
This low volume of trades could also cause the price of our stock to fluctuate greatly, with large percentage changes in price occurring
in any trading day session. Holders of our Common Stock may also not be able to readily liquidate their investment or may be forced to
sell at depressed prices due to low volume trading. If high spreads between the bid and ask prices of our Common Stock exist at the time
of a purchase, the stock would have to appreciate substantially on a relative percentage basis for an investor to recoup their investment.
Broad market fluctuations and general economic and political conditions may also adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.
No assurance can be given that an active market in our Common Stock will develop or be sustained. If an active market does not develop,
holders of our Common Stock may be unable to readily sell the shares they hold or may not be able to sell their shares at all. 

7 

LOSS
OF CONTROL BY OUR PRESENT MANAGEMENT AND STOCKHOLDERS MAY OCCUR UPON ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SHARES. 

We may issue
further Shares as consideration for the cash or assets or services out of our authorized but unissued Common Stock that would, upon issuance,
represent a majority of our voting power and equity. The result of such an issuance would be those new stockholders and management would
control us, and persons unknown could replace our current management. Such an occurrence would result in a greatly reduced percentage
of ownership of us by our current Shareholders. 

WE DO
NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK 

We do not
anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. 

WE MAY
BE UNSUCCESSFUL IN FINDING A MERGER THAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH POSITIVE LONG-TERM RESULTS 

The business
of selecting and entering into a merger is fraught with all kinds of issues. For instance, the business may need capital that is never
raised, the management is not capable of carrying the business forward successfully, the business plan is ill conceived, and not executed,
or competitive factors cause business failure. There are many other factors in addition to these, as may have been discussed above in
 Risk Factors which could cause our company to fail and the investor s capital will be at risk. 

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 

None. 

ITEM
2. PROPERTIES 

We do not
own or lease any properties. 

The Company
has no properties and at this time has no agreements to acquire any properties. The Company currently uses an office provided by Mr. Cacciamatta,
the Company s President and CEO, at no cost to the Company. Mr. Cacciamatta has agreed to continue this arrangement until the Company
completes an acquisition or merger. We presently do not own any equipment, and do not intend to purchase or lease any equipment prior
to or upon completion of a business combination. 

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

Neither
we nor any of our officers, directors, or holders of five percent or more of our Common Stock is a party to any pending legal proceedings
and to the best of our knowledge, no such proceedings by or against us or our officers, or directors or holders of five percent or more
of our Common Stock have been threatened or is pending against us.

by the OTC Markets under the symbol CONC . The trading volume is very limited, averaging approximately one share daily. The

Record Holders. 

There were 325 holders of record as of January
31, 2023. In many instances, a registered stockholder is a broker or other entity holding shares in street name for one or more customers
who beneficially own the shares.

Our transfer
agent is Signature Stock Transfer, Inc. 14673 Midway Road, Suite 220, Addison, Texas 75001. Their telephone number is (972) 612-4120. 

Dividend
Policy 

We have
never paid cash dividends and have no plans to do so in the foreseeable future. Our future dividend policy will be determined by our board
of directors and will depend upon a number of factors, including our financial condition and performance, our cash needs and expansion
plans, income tax consequences, and the restrictions that applicable laws, any future preferred stock instruments, and any future credit
arrangements may then impose.

Not applicable. The financial statements included

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management conducted an evaluation, with the
participation of our Chief Executive Officer, who is our principal executive officer and our principal financial and accounting officer,
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based
on that evaluation, we concluded that because of the material weakness and significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial
reporting described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not sufficient as of December 31, 2022. Such weaknesses and deficiencies
are principally caused by our lack of employees and financial resources.

ITEM 10. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

Directors

The following
table sets forth the name, age, and position with us for our sole director and officer as of September 30, 2022: 

Name 
 
 Age 
 
 Position 
 
 Since 
 
 Danilo Cacciamatta 
 
 77 
 
 Director, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer 
 
 August, 2020 

Danilo
Cacciamatta has served as our sole director and officer since August 1, 2020. He was elected to the Board of Directors of California
First National Bancorp in June 2001. In June 2020, he was elected to the Board of Directors of West Texas Resources. Inc. Mr. Cacciamatta
was the CEO of Cacciamatta Accountancy Corporation, a PCAOB registered independent public accounting firm specializing in audits of SEC
reporting companies, from 1989 to 2010. From 1972 to 1988, Mr. Cacciamatta was with KPMG Peat Marwick, first as a management consultant
in Milan, Italy, and later in the audit group of the Orange County office in California. He was elected to partnership in 1980. His CPA
license from the state of California is currently inactive. Mr. Cacciamatta graduated from Pomona College with a B.A in economics and
the University of California at Riverside with an M.B.A. 

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST GENERAL 

Our sole director and officer is, or may become,
in his individual capacity, an officer, director, controlling shareholder and/or partner of other entities engaged in a variety of businesses.
Thus, there exist potential conflicts of interest including, among other things, time, efforts, and corporation opportunity, involved
in participation with such other business entities. While our sole officer and director of our business is engaged in business activities
outside of our business, he devotes to our business such time as he believes to be necessary. 

CONFLICTS
OF INTEREST CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES 

There are
no requirements in our Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws which requires officers and directors of the Company to disclose to us business
opportunities which come to their attention. Our officers and directors do, however, have a fiduciary duty of loyalty to us to disclose
to us any business opportunities which come to their attention, in their capacity as an officer and/or director or otherwise. Excluded
from this duty would be opportunities which the person learns about through his involvement as an officer and director of another company.
We have no intention of merging with or acquiring an affiliate, associate person or business opportunity from any affiliate or any client
of any such person. 

COMMITTEES
OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 

The members
of our Board are elected for one-year terms, to hold office until the next general meeting of stockholders, or until removed from office
in accordance with our bylaws. 

Our Board
does not maintain a separate audit, nominating or compensation committee. Functions customarily performed by such committees are performed
by the Board as a whole. 

Code
of Ethics 

To date,
we have not adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to our principal executive officer and principal financial officer because the Company
has no meaningful operations. The Company does not believe that a formal written code of ethics is necessary at this time. We expect that
the Company will adopt a code of ethics if and when the Company successfully completes a business combination that results in the acquisition
of an on-going business and thereby commences operations.

ITEM
11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Cacciamatta was our sole director and officer for fiscal years 2021 and 2022. He served on an interim basis until August 1, 2020, on which

1 Nature of business and organization 

ConectiSys
Corporation (the Company was incorporated in Colorado on February 2, 1986, under the name Coastal Financial Corp. On December
5, 1994, Coastal Financial Corp. changed its name to BDR Industries, Inc. which changed its name on October 16, 1995, to ConectiSys Corporation. 

The Company
was engaged in the development of a low-cost automatic meter reading, or AMR, solution until it ceased all business activity in 2008. 

Conectisys
was an SEC reporting company until 2008. Its last Form 10-K, for the fiscal year 2007, was filed on Jan 4, 2008; its last Form 10-Q, for
the three and nine months ended June 30, 2008, was filed on Sep. 15, 2008.

Note
2 Basis of Presentation and Summary of significant accounting policies 

Basis
of presentation 

The accompanying
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America U.S. GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission SEC ). 

The Company
changed its fiscal year end from September 30 to December 31 on January 31, 2023. The change did not result in any material differences
in the Company s financial statements because the Company has minimal activities and its quarterly operating results are immaterial
and comparable. 

Cash
and cash equivalents 

Cash and
cash equivalents consist of amounts of cash on hand and bank deposits. 

Use of
estimates and assumptions 

The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of
assets and liabilities reported and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Income
taxes 

The Company
accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their perspective
tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are recorded, when necessary,
to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. 

The Company
has adopted the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes. 

Commitments
and Contingencies 

In the ordinary
course of business, the Company is subject to certain contingencies, including legal proceedings and claims arising out of the business
that relate to a wide range of matters, such as government investigations and tax matters. The Company recognizes a liability for such
contingency if it determines it is probable that a loss has occurred and a reasonable estimate of the loss can be made. The Company may
consider many factors in making these assessments including historical and specific facts and circumstances of each matter. 

Earnings
per share 

Basic earnings
per share are computed by dividing net income attributable to holders of Common Stock by the weighted average number of Common Stock outstanding
during the year. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities to issue Common Stock were issued. 

Recently
issued accounting pronouncements 

The Company
does not believe that recently issued accounting standards will have a material effect on its financial statements. 

Subsequent
events 

The Company
evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date through the date that the financial statements
are available to be issued. There are no material subsequent events that required recognition or additional disclosure. 

Going
concern 

The accompanying
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of
the Company as a going concern. Additional capital infusion is necessary in order to fund current expenditures, acquire business opportunities
and achieve profitable operations. This factor raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The Company s
management intends to continue funding current expenditures and to raise additional funds. However, there can be no assurance that management
will be successful in this endeavor.

Effective
March 10, 2021, the Company implemented a 10,000 to 1 reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The number of
post-split shares held by each shareholder will be rounded up to the nearest digit, with a minimum of 1 share. Accordingly, our transfer
agent will determine the exact number of shares outstanding post-split. The computation of basic and diluted Loss per Share was retroactively
adjusted for all periods presented.

The total
number of authorized shares of capital stock, as amended, is currently 300,000,000, consisting of 250,000,000 common shares, no par value,
and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The number of post-split common shares outstanding is 888,579, of which 838,100 are owned by
our sole director and officer. Of the 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, 1,000,000 shares are designated Class A, 1.00 par value per
share, with each share having voting rights equal to 100 common shares. In addition, 1,000,000 shares are designated Class B, 1.00 par
value per share, with each share convertible into 10 common shares. The remaining 48,000,000 preferred shares authorized are undesignated.
None of the preferred shares are issued and outstanding.
