Item 1. Business. 

For over 35 years, Electronic Systems Technology,
Inc. EST , us , we , our or the Company has specialized in the development
and manufacturing of digital data (non-voice) radio transceivers for use in industrial wireless networking applications. With reliance
on wireless communication in the modern world, the global modernization of industrial control systems now requires the benefits gained
by use of wireless technology. EST designs, manufactures, develops and produces these specialized, hardened products uniquely designed
to operate and survive in these difficult environments in which these systems must perform. 

The Company s ESTeem line of products provide
innovative communication solutions for harsh environment applications not served or that are underutilized by conventional, commercial
grade communication systems. Our products are part of the ESTeem Industrial Wireless Solutions for commercial, industrial, and government
arenas both domestically and internationally. We market through direct sales, sales representatives, resellers and system integrators 

EST was incorporated in the State of Washington in
February 1984 and was granted a United States Patent for the Wireless Computer Modem in May 1987, and Canadian patent in
October 1988. We registered and commenced building brand recognition on the trade name of ESTeem Wireless Modems in
2007. After reviewing for marketability and profitability, our strategy is to provide product improvements and enhancements that incorporate
technological developments in response to customer needs and market opportunities arising from changes in FCC regulations or technological
developments. 

Development efforts in 2022 were focused primarily
on software enhancements and hardware maintenance for the ESTeem Horizon Series. These next generation industrial wireless products
will improve our networking capability with higher data rates, improved security, improved support features and updates to the latest
wireless standards. 

In an effort to maintain and expand our customer base
in the industrial control marketplace, we team with major automation hardware vendors such as Rockwell Automation. Our 30-year relationship
with Rockwell Automation s Encompass Program delivers significant benefits via increased exposure to markets that would not otherwise
be available to us. Rockwell Automation has the largest market share in the United States and is a major entity in the world-wide automation
and controls marketplace.

PRODUCTS AND MARKETS 

ESTeem industrial wireless products provide communication
links between computer networks, network enabled devices and mobile devices without cables. The widespread use of networked computer systems
in business, industry and public service and the adoption of mobile devices in all aspects of modern life has created an environment where
the wireless network is no longer a convenience but a necessity. As wireless networking proliferates through the modernization of the
industrial sector the need for our products, which are specifically designed for rigors of operation in harsh environments, is increasing
dramatically. Wireless networks are the backbone connections to the Internet for cloud-based services such as the Internet of Things IoT and Industrial Internet of Things IIoT ). 

All of the ESTeem models come with industry standard
Ethernet (Internet) communication ports and legacy serial ports to provide the broadest range of connections for both new and legacy hardware.
The combined features such as AES 128 or AES 256 security encryption, self-healing repeaters, mesh networking, long range operation and
outdoor weatherproof cases make the ESTeem products unique in our market space. 

PRODUCT APPLICATIONS 

Major applications and industries in which ESTeem 
products are being utilized are as follows: 

Water/Wastewater 
 Mining 
 
 Oil/Gas 
 Industrial Automation 

PRODUCT LINES 

We manufacture nine (9) models of the ESTeem 
industrial wireless modems that operate in frequency from 150 MHz to 5.8 GHz. A wireless modem is a hardware device for sending and receiving
data over a radio carrier and is the foundation of our industrial wireless solution. Each model will fit best in a specific application
based upon several factors such as distance, required data rate and Federal Communication Commission FCC licensing requirements.
Each wireless network is discussed in detail with the end customer to determine the best overall solution for their application. No single
model or frequency band can solve all applications and having a diverse product selection is critical for expanding our customer base.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND NEW PRODUCTS 

Our products compete in an environment of rapidly
changing technology which results in the necessity for continuous updates and enhancements. Research and development expenditures for
new product development and improvements of existing products for 2022 and 2021 were 163,189 and 212,397 respectively. None of our research
and development expenses were paid directly by any of our customers. We contract with third parties for software development and hardware
design as needed. Development efforts during 2022 were focused primarily on software enhancements for the ESTeem Horizon Series and
the redesign of the Horizon900. Research and development expenditures will continue, in order to meet our customers evolving needs. 

MARKETING, CUSTOMERS AND SUPPORT 

The majority of our products sold during 2022 were
through the reselling efforts of non-exclusive, non-stocking distributors and resellers, and the remainder our sales were direct to end-users.
Orders are generally placed on an as needed basis . Shipping of products is usually completed 1 to 15 working days after
receipt of a customer order, with the exception of ongoing scheduled projects and custom designed equipment for specific applications.
Our sales order backlog at year end was 49,173. 

We advertise in trade publications and attend trade
shows specifically targeting industrial automation systems. We provide support personnel and maintain an internet web site to provide
access to product and technical information for customers. We provide technical support and service for our products and installations
through phone support, field technicians and internet sources. High quality customer support is vital to differentiate ourselves in our
marketplace. We intend to maintain this high level of customer support by investing in our customer service programs.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 

To protect the Company against unauthorized disclosure
of proprietary information belonging to the Company, all employees, dealers, distributors, original equipment manufacturers, sales representatives
and other persons having access to confidential information regarding Company products or technology are bound by nondisclosure agreements.
Rights to the ESTeem Wireless Modems, trademark were renewed in 2014. The initial patents granted in 1987 and 1988 have expired and
we currently have no patents on any of our products. 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

For operation in the United States, the ESTeem 
industrial wireless products require FCC type acceptance which is granted for devices demonstrating operation within mandated and tested
performance criteria. All of our products requiring FCC type acceptance have been granted such acceptance, and all except the Horizon4.9
have been granted such acceptance in Canada. 

The ESTeem industrial wireless products that
operate in the FCC licensed frequency band require licensing under Part 90 of the FCC Rules and Regulations which must be applied for
by the end user. We provide information to customers to assist in the application for FCC consumer licenses, although we cannot guarantee
FCC licenses in a given frequency spectrum for a particular application will be received. 

While there can be no assurance that future FCC regulations
will not have material adverse effects on our operations, we are unaware of any such existing or proposed FCC regulations at this time.

SOURCE OF SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING 

Components are purchased through a number of distributors
and key component suppliers, such as Hitachi, Motorola, and others, some of which have long lead times. Although these components could
be replaced or substituted by other products, if necessary, a significant interruption or delay in their availability could have a material
adverse effect on our business. 

Approximately 47 of the Company s inventory 
at December 31, 2022 consisted of parts having lead times ranging from 12 to 30 weeks. Some parts are maintained at high levels to assure
availability to meet production requirements, thus, accounting for a significant portion of the Company s inventory value. Based
on past experience with component availability, distributor relationships, and inventory levels, we do not foresee shortages of materials.
However, developments in the electronic component marketplace, which are also used in cellular phones, personal technology devices and
other technology devices, have the potential of creating negative availability and delivery issues for components used by us. Although
we have been able to procure parts on a timely basis as of the date of this report, however procurement cannot be guaranteed in the future.
If shortages were to occur, material interruption of production and product delivery to customers would result. 

The Company contracts with multiple companies for
manufacturing of sub-assemblies and some engineering assistance services as needed. By contracting with these companies, the Company is
able to avoid staff fluctuations associated with operating its own manufacturing and reduced capital investments in specialized manufacturing
equipment. We review the costs for the services provided by these companies and regularly submits Requests for Quotes (RFQ) to multiple
suppliers of these operations. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ,
and Financial Statements . 

ACCESS TO COMPANY INFORMATION 

The Registrant does not issue annual or quarterly
reports to security holders other than the annual Form 10-K and quarterly Forms 10-Q as electronically filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC and available for viewing at www.sec.gov. Electronically filed reports may be accessed at www.sec.gov or
via the Company s website at www.esteem.com. We make available on our website such reports as soon as reasonably practicable after
they are filed with the SEC. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of December 31, 2022, we employ 8 persons on a
full-time basis (4 in sales/marketing, 3 in engineering/manufacturing, and 1 in finance and administration). The Company s operations
are dependent upon key members of its engineering and management personnel, which, if lost to the Company, could have a material adverse
effect on our business. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

Our common stock value and our business, results
of operations, cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks, including, but not limited to those set forth below. If
any of the following risks actually occurs, our common stock, business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could
be materially adversely affected. These risk factors should be carefully considered together with the other information in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, including the risks and uncertainties described under the heading Forward-Looking Statements. This
list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect the Company s forward-looking statements. Some of the important risks and
uncertainties that could affect forward-looking statements are described further under the sections titled Risk Factors and Uncertainties ,
 Description of Business and Management s Discussion and Analysis of this Annual Report. If any of the
events described in the risk factors below actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer significantly.
In such case, the value of your investment could decline and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock. Forward-looking
statements are subject to a variety of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause actual events or results
to differ from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation: 

We cannot predict whether we will be able to sustain
revenue growth, profitability or positive cash flow. Our products are sold in highly competitive markets. Our revenues and operating
results may be negatively affected by technology changes in our markets, economic conditions in our markets, and the level of competition
in our markets. 

7 

Our marketing efforts may be unsuccessful due to
limited marketing and sales capabilities. Our limited national advertising and sales coverage may result in our markets not being
fully penetrated. The lack of market penetration may result in an adverse effect on our revenues. We must continue to develop and maintain
appropriate marketing, sales, technical, customer service and distribution capabilities, or enter into agreements with third parties to
provide these services, to successfully market our products. A failure to develop these capabilities or obtain third-party agreements
could adversely affect us. 

We may be unable to produce products for sale if
we are unable to obtain component materials. Our products require highly specialized components, which are subject to rapid obsolescence,
limited availability and design change. Many of the components in our products are also used in cellular phone, pagers and other technology
devices. If we cannot obtain material to produce products, our sales revenues will be negatively impacted. 

Our success depends on our ability to retain key
management personnel . The success of our Company depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified management,
administrative, manufacturing, sales, and research and development personnel. Due to the specialized nature of our business, it may be
difficult to locate and hire qualified personnel. Our success is significantly dependent on the performance and continued service of key
members of Management, such as Chief Executive Officer, Dan Tolley and Chief Financial Officer Michael Eller, and certain other key employees.
If the services of any members of Management become unavailable for any reason, our business and prospects could be adversely affected.
Although we have been successful in retaining highly capable and qualified management in the past, there can be no assurance that we will
be able to do so in the future. 

We may be adversely affected by government regulation. 
The Federal Communication Commission (FCC) governs use of the products we sell. If the FCC were to implement rules detrimental to our
products and the markets in which they are offered, our operations would be negatively impacted. 

Rapid technological changes in our industry may
adversely affect us if we do not keep pace with advancing technology. The wireless communication market is characterized by rapidly
advancing technology. Our success depends on our ability to keep pace with advancing technology, processes and standards, such as cellular
telephone based technology. We intend to continue to develop and enhance our products to meet perceived market opportunities. However,
our development efforts may be rendered obsolete by research efforts and technological advances made by others, and devices other than
those we currently produce may prove more advantageous. 

The market for our common stock is limited and
our shareholders may have difficulty reselling their shares when desired or at attractive market prices . Our stock price and our listing
may make it more difficult for our shareholders to resell shares when desired or at attractive prices. Our Company stock trades on the
 over-the-counter market and is listed on OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets. Our common stock has continued to trade in low volumes
and at low prices. Some investors view low-priced stocks as unduly speculative and therefore not appropriate candidates for investment.
Many institutional investors have internal policies prohibiting the purchase or maintenance of positions in low-priced stocks. 

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. 

None. 

8 

Item 2. Properties. 

We do not own any real property, plants, mines, or
any other materially important physical properties. The Company s administrative offices, inventory and laboratories are located
in leased facilities at 415 N. Roosevelt Street, STE B1, Kennewick, Washington. The Company leases approximately 5,270 square feet of
office and laboratory space by a lease agreement with the Port of Kennewick in Kennewick, Washington. As of December 31, 2022, the total
monthly lease cost, including tax, is 3,806. The lease initially covered a period of two years, expiring September 2024. 

We also own miscellaneous assets, such as computer
equipment, laboratory equipment, and furnishings. We maintain insurance in such amounts and covering such losses, contingencies and occurrences
deemed adequate to protect our property. Insurance coverage includes a comprehensive liability policy covering legal liability for bodily
injury or death of persons, and for property owned by, or under our control, as well as damage to the property of others. We also maintain
fidelity insurance which provides coverage to the Company in the event of employee dishonesty.

and Results of Operations. 

Management s discussion and analysis is provided
as supplement to, and is intended to be read in conjunction with, the Company s audited financial statements and the accompanying
integral notes Notes thereto. The following statements may be forward-looking in nature and actual results may differ
materially. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

GENERAL: We specialize in the manufacturing and development
of data radio products. The Company offers product lines which provide innovative communication solutions for applications not served
by existing conventional communication systems. We offer product lines in markets for process automation in commercial, industrial and

FISCAL YEAR 2022 vs. FISCAL YEAR 2021 

GROSS REVENUES: Total revenues for the fiscal year
2022 were 1,910,061 reflecting an increase of 26.3 from 1,512,028 in gross revenues for fiscal year 2021. During the year ended December
31, 2022, two customers sales accounted for more than 10 of the total sales revenues. The increase in total revenues is the result
of increased product sales during 2022. Domestic Sales for the fiscal year were 1,697,261 compared to 1,341,287 in 2021. Sales to Foreign
Customers for the fiscal year were 212,800 compared to 170,741 in 2021. Product sales increased to 1,881,661 in 2022, as compared to
2021 sales of 1,458,328 reflecting an increase of 29.0 . 

Interest revenues during 2022 increased to 5,217
from 2021 level of 2,488 due to the increased interest rates for the certificates of deposit held by the Company and the reduction of
the value of the certificates held during 2022. Other income decreased to 63,000 for the gain on employee retention tax credit compared
to 280,373 of gain on forgiveness of CARES Act loan in 2021. 

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had sales backlog
of 49,173. The Company s customers generally place orders on an as needed basis . Shipment of the Company s
products is generally completed within 1 to 15 working days after receipt of customer orders, with the exception of ongoing, scheduled
projects, and custom designed equipment for specific customer applications. 

COST OF SALES: Cost of Sales, as a percentage of net
sales, was 46.1 and 49.2 respectively, for 2022 and 2021. Cost of Sales variances are the result of differences in the product mix sold
and occurrences of obsolete inventory expense, as well as differences in the price discounting structure for the mix of products sold
during the period. 

INVENTORY: The Company s year-end inventory
values for 2022 and 2021 were as follows: 

2022 
 2021 
 
 Parts 
 172,190 
 92,751 
 
 Work in progress 
 336,298 
 171,705 
 
 Finished goods 
 216,990 
 237,377 
 
 TOTAL 
 725,478 
 501,833 

The Company s objective is to maintain inventory
levels as low as possible to provide maximum cash liquidity, while at the same time meet production and delivery requirements. Inventory
levels were increased during the year due to concerns with regards to supply chain issues with long-lead time items. 

OPERATING EXPENSES: Operating expenses decreased to
 950,338 in 2022 from 2021 levels of 957,654. Significant changes in expenses are comprised of the following components: decreases in
services purchased 35,375), professional services 47,261), travel 2,971), and depreciation 4,725) offset by increases in salaries
and benefits 82,328) and taxes, licenses and health insurance costs 11,293). 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

The Company s revenues and expenses resulted
in net income of 146,531 for 2022, an increase from net income of 92,989 for 2021. At December 31, 2022, the Company s working
capital was 1,747,472 compared with 1,610,537 at December 31, 2021. The Company s operations rely solely on the income generated
from sales. The Company s major capital resource requirements are payment of employee salaries and benefits and maintaining inventory
levels adequate for production. Extended availability for components critical for production of the Company s products, ranging
from 12 to 52 weeks, require the Company to maintain high inventory levels. It is management s opinion that the Company s
working capital as of December 31, 2022 is adequate for expected resource requirements for the next twelve months. During the twelve month
period ending December 31, 2022, the Company had positive cash flow of 95,502. 

11 

The Company s current asset to current liability
ratio at December 31, 2022 was 8.6:1 compared to 12.7:1 at December 31, 2021. The decrease in current asset ratio is the result of the
Company having increased accounts payable for year-end 2022 when compared with year-end 2021. The Company s liquid resources at
December 31, 2022, including cash and cash equivalent and certificates of deposits, were 1,002,817, compared to 1,055,616 at December
31, 2021. The decrease in liquid resources is the result increases in inventory levels in 2022. The Company s accounts receivable
at December 31, 2022 were 141,394, compared to 166,303 at December 31, 2021. Management believes that all Company accounts receivable
as of December 31, 2022 are collectible and does not have a reserve for uncollectable accounts. 

The Company believes the level of risk associated
with customer receipts on export sales is minimal. Foreign shipments are made only after payment has been received or on Net 30 day credit
terms to established foreign companies with which the Company has distributor relationships. Foreign orders are generally filled as soon
as they are received therefore; foreign exchange rate fluctuations do not impact the Company. 

Inventories at December 31, 2022 were 725,478, reflecting
an increase from December 31, 2021 balance of 501,833. The increase in inventory between December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 is due
to management s decision to purchase more items crucial to manufacture goods with lead times in excess of 12 weeks. 

We had capital expenditures 0 during 2022. The Company
intends on investing in additional capital equipment as deemed necessary to support development and manufacture of current and future
products. 

As of December 31, 2022, our current liabilities increased
to 228,652 from 137,637 at December 31, 2021. The increase in current liabilities was impacted by an increase in accounts payable to
 138,996 from 71,645. 

We had no off-balance sheet arrangements for the year
ended December 31, 2022. 

Inflation had minimal adverse effect on the Company s
operations during 2022. Minimal adverse effect is anticipated during 2023. 

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS: The above discussion may
contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. These factors are more fully described in the Risk
Factors section of Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to the factors discussed above, among other factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following: competitive factors such as rival wireless architectures and price
pressures; availability of third party component products at reasonable prices; inventory risks due to shifts in market demand and/or
price erosion of purchased components; change in product mix, rapid advances in competing technologies and risk factors that are listed
in the Company s reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders 
Electronic Systems Technology, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of
Electronic Systems Technology, Inc. the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of operations,
changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

Critical audit matters are matters arising from the
current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that
(1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective,
or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters. 

Supplemental Information 

The supplemental schedule of operating expenses for
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 the supplemental information has been subjected to audit procedures performed
in conjunction with the audit of the Company s financial statements. The supplemental information is the responsibility of the Company s
management. Our audit procedures included determining whether the supplemental information reconciles to the financial statements or the
underlying accounting and other records, as applicable, and performing procedures to test the completeness and accuracy of the information
presented in the supplemental information. In forming our opinion on the supplemental information, we evaluated whether the supplemental
information, including its form and content, is presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. In our opinion, the supplemental information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the financial statements
as a whole.

of ESTeem Wireless Modems. 

The Company receives payments from customers
based on the terms established in our contracts. When amounts are billed and collected before the services are performed, they are included
in deferred revenues. The Company does not generally sell its products with the right of return. Therefore, returns are accounted for
when they occur and are accepted. Products sold to foreign customers are shipped after payment is received in U.S. funds, unless an established
distributor relationship exists, or the customer is a foreign branch of a U.S. company. 

The Company warrants its products as free
of manufacturing defects and provides a refund of the purchase price, repair or replacement of the product for a period of one year from
the date of installation by the first user/customer. No allowance for estimated warranty repairs or product returns has been recorded
due to the Company s historical experience of repairs and product returns.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

Under the supervision and with the participation of
our Management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as such terms are defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of the
end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation o ur principal executive officer
and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at December 31,

Management s Annual Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting. 

The Company s management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. The Company s internal control
over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external
purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial
reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that
receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be
prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended
to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. 

As of December 31, 2022, management conducted an assessment
of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control
over financial reporting established in Internal Control Integrated Framework, (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. Management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s
Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2022 and concluded that we have maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting at December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. 

There have been
no changes in the company s internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed quarter that have materially
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Indemnification 

The Company s By-Laws address indemnification
of Directors and Officers. Washington Law provides that Washington corporations may include within their Articles of Incorporation provisions
eliminating or limiting the personal liability of their directors and officers in shareholder actions brought to obtain damages for alleged
breaches of fiduciary duties, as long as the alleged acts or omissions did not involve intentional misconduct, fraud, a knowing violation
of law or payment of dividends in violation of the Washington statutes. Washington law also allows Washington corporations to include
in their Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws provisions to the effect that expenses of officers and directors incurred in defending a
civil or criminal action must be paid by the corporation as they are incurred, subject to an undertaking on behalf of the officer or director
that he or she will repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such officer or director
is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation because such officer or director did not act in good faith and in a manner reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation. The Company s Articles of Incorporation provide that
a director or officer is not personally liable to the Company or its shareholders for damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director
or officer, except for liability for (i) acts or omissions which involve intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law,
or (ii) the payment of distribution in violation of Washington Business Corporation Act. 

Related Person Transactions Policy and Procedures 

As set forth in the written charter of the Audit Committee,
any related person transaction involving a Company director or executive officer must be reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee.
Any member of the Audit Committee who is a related person with respect to a transaction under review may not participate in the deliberations
or vote on the approval or ratification of the transaction. Related persons include any director or executive officer, certain shareholders
and any of their immediate family members (as defined by SEC regulations).
