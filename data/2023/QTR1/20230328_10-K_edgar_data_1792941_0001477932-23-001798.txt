The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements for Genvor Incorporated Such discussion represents only the best present assessment from our Management. PART I Item 1: Description of Business Genvor Incorporated (the Company or Genvor was incorporated in Florida on September 26, 2018, as Allure Worldwide, Inc., and as of November 18, 2019, redomiciled to Nevada. On June 24, 2022, the Company changed its name to from Allure Worldwide, Inc. to Genvor Incorporated. The Company was originally formed with the intention of seeking to acquire the assets or shares of an entity actively engaged in business which generates revenues, in exchange for its securities. On January 11, 2021, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with Genvor Inc., a Delaware corporation Genvor to acquire (the Acquisition Genvor. On March 2, 2022, the Company and Genvor entered into a merger agreement (the Merger Agreement to consummate the Acquisition, and pursuant to which a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Genvor Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation, would merge (the Merger with and into Genvor, with each share of Genvor common stock issued immediately prior to the time of the merger automatically converted into the right to receive one share of common stock of the Company. On May 27, 2022, the Acquisition closed, Merger Subsidiary merged with and into Genvor, each share of Genvor was exchanged for the right to receive one share of Company common stock, 35,261,871 shares of Company common stock were issued to Genvor s pre-merger shareholders (the Merger Shares ), constituting a change of control of the Company, and Genvor became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result of these transactions, the Company had 55,261,871 issued and outstanding common shares upon the closing of the share exchange with Genvor, and subsequently the Company s original founding shareholders cancelled 18,144,112 shares of Company common stock in connection with the Acquisition. As a result of the Acquisition, the Company s business plan is that of Genvor, and the Company is developing plant-based defense technology designed to help farmers achieve global food security. Genvor History The Company s subsidiary, Genvor Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 4, 2019, as Nexion Biosciences Inc., and on January 22, 2020, its name was changed to Genvor Inc. Genvor Inc. develops plant-based defense technology designed to help farmers achieve global food security. During May 2019, Genvor Inc. acquired Nexion Biosciences LLC NBLLC from a founder for nominal consideration. NBLLC was formed in the State of Delaware on December 28, 2018. 3 Table of Contents Genvor s technology was developed by two university scientists, Dr. Clayton Yates and Dr. Jesse Jaynes, who shared a mission to develop crop protection technology designed to defend against crop diseases effecting both animals and humans alike. Genvor s technology is currently being advanced by the USDA in corn seed varieties and with U.S. Sugar in citrus trees. Genvor s headquarters is located at 13155 Noel Road, Suite 900, Dallas, Texas, 75240. Genvor s Plan of Operation The United States Food and Agriculture Organization reports that annual global crop losses due to plant pathogens and viruses are now estimated to exceed 100 billion. Alarming to the FDA are the fungi Aspergillus Flavus, which produce Aflatoxins, a toxic and carcinogenic compound known to cause liver cancer in humans and animals. Aspergillus Flavus is also the second leading cause of aspergillosis in humans. Patients infected with Aspergillus flavus often have reduced or compromised immune systems. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration estimates the annual cost of Aflatoxin contamination in the United States at approximately 500 million through two categories of loss: market rejection and animal health impacts. As a result, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has imposed strict guidelines for crop inspection and discovery of diseased crops caused by Aflatoxins. Both planted fields and harvested crops that are found to be contaminated beyond permitted testing levels must be destroyed. As a result, farmers and growers can be exposed to catastrophic economic losses. This Aflatoxin problem has created a significant opportunity for agricultural companies who can develop the technology needed to defend against Aflatoxins. Genvor s Solution Genvor s technology is the only known solution that Genvor is aware of, which Genvor believes provides broad spectrum effectiveness against Aspergillus Flavus and Aflatoxins. This technology is deliverable by both bioengineered seed trait, as well as through biopesticide application. Dr. Jaynes, one of Genvor s founders, has been on a 30+ year quest to find a global crop solution for defense against Aflatoxins. As a result of successful testing and collaboration between Dr. Jaynes and the United States Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Research Service (USDA-ARS), the USDA-ARS awarded Genvor with a Cooperative Research Development Agreement in August of 2018. The stated goal of this agreement is to develop and commercialize disease resistant and nutritionally enhanced corn seed varieties using Genvor s seed trait technology. Seed Traits In the United States, the adoption of crop seeds with enhanced traits has been staggering. Currently, over 90 percent of U.S. corn, cotton and soybeans are produced using seeds with enhanced traits. Trait fees for these three crops alone represent over 2 billion annually based on an average trait fee of 13 per acre on approximately 170 million acres. U.S. corn crops alone account for roughly 1.2 billion of the estimated 2 billion. Biopesticides Biopesticides are one of the fastest-growing crop protection market sectors, increasing at twice the compound annual growth rate of the crop protection market as a whole. Primary drivers of this growth include a rising global demand for organic foods, the trend in the reduction of chemical residues, stricter import and supermarket standards, shorter pre-harvest intervals, a push for sustainability, and the demand for additional modes of action for managing resistance. The biopesticide market in north America alone is currently estimated to be over 4.8 billion annually. Genvor s technology is effective with corn seed and is believed by Genvor to be effective with many known crop types, and the technology may be delivered as a topical spray in the form of a biopesticide. Genvor Incorporated Genvor or the Company was incorporated in the State of Florida on September 26, 2018, 4 Table of Contents Reports to Security Holders We intend to furnish our shareholders annual reports containing financial statements audited by our independent registered public accounting firm and to make available quarterly reports containing unaudited financial statements for each of the first three quarters of each year.

Securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans The Company does not have a stock option plan. Penny Stock Our common stock is considered "penny stock" under the rules the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than 5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market System, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or quotation system. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the Commission, that: contains a description of the nature and level of risks in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; contains a description of the broker's or dealer's duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements of Securities' laws; contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price; contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions; defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and contains such other information and is in such form, including language, type, size and format, as the Commission shall require by rule or regulation. 6 Table of Contents The broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, the customer with: bid and offer quotations for the penny stock; the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction; the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the marker for such stock; and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. In addition, the penny stock rules that require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written acknowledgement of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitably statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock. Related Stockholder Matters None. Purchase of Equity Securities None. Item 6.

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and summary of selected financial data for the Company. Such discussion represents only the best present assessment from our Management. DESCRIPTION OF COMPANY Genvor Incorporated (the Company was incorporated in Florida on September 26, 2018, as Allure Worldwide, Inc., and as of November 18, 2019, redomiciled to Nevada.

The Company s technology was developed by two university scientists, Dr. Clayton Yates and Dr. Jesse Jaynes, who shared a mission to develop crop protection technology designed to defend against crop diseases effecting both animals and humans alike. The Company s technology is currently being advanced by the USDA in corn seed varieties and with U.S. Sugar in citrus trees. The following Management Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in this Form 10-K. COMPARISON OF THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022, TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021 Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021, and related management discussion herein. Our financial statements are stated in U.S. Dollars and are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States GAAP ). Going Concern Qualification Several conditions and events cast substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. At September 30, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 16,288,417, incurred a net loss of 4,486,589 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, requires capital for contemplated operational activities to take place. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans with respect to operations include raising additional capital through sales of equity or debt securities as may be necessary to pursue such business plans and sustain operations until such time as the Company can merge with or be acquired by another entity. However, there can be no assurance that management will be successful in obtaining additional funding or in attaining profitable operations. The ability to successfully resolve these factors raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 8 Table of Contents Our operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, and year ended December 31, 2021, and the changes between those periods for the respective items, are summarized as follows: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 Year Ended December 31, 2021 Operating loss (4,310,361 (3,101,904 Total other income (expense) (176,228 (337,620 Net loss (4,486,589 (3,439,524 Revenues We did not earn any revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, or the year ended December 31, 2021. Operating Loss Our loss from operations increased to 4,310,361 during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, from an operating loss of 3,101,904 in the year ended December 31, 2021. The following table presents operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, and the year ended December 31, 2021: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 Year Ended December 31, 2021 Professional fees 233,153 89,640 Payroll related expenses 120,725 390,000 Research and development 246,480 226,448 Stock-based compensation 3,512,500 2,222,961 Depreciation expense 1,374 1,832 General and administrative expenses 196,129 171,023 Total Operating Expenses 4,310,361 3,101,904 We realized an increase in professional fees during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of increased accounting, audit, and legal expenses incurred during 2022. Stock-based compensation expenses increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of the issuance of shares of common stock. Net Loss The Company incurred a net loss of 4,486,589 during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to a net loss of 3,439,524 during the year ended December 31, 2021, as a result of the increased operating expenses during 2022 described above. Liquidity and Capital Resources Based upon our current financial condition, we do not have sufficient cash to operate our business at the current level for the next twelve months. We intend to fund operations through debt and/or equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund expenditures or other cash requirements. We plan to seek additional financing in a private equity offering to secure funding for operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional funding. If we are not able to secure additional funding, the implementation of our business plan will be impaired. There can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. 9 Table of Contents Working Capital The following table presents our working capital position as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021: September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Cash 296,385 384,621 Current Assets 298,385 535,952 Current Liabilities 1,867,654 2,449,808 Working Capital (Deficiency) (1,569,269 (1,913,856 The decrease in working capital deficiency as of September 30, 2022, as compared to December 31, 2021, was primarily due to notes payable decreasing from 1,632,250 as of December 31, 2021, to 1,100,750 as of September 30, 2022, partially offset by the decrease current assets as of September 30, 2022, as compared to December 31, 2021. Cash Flow We fund our operations with cash received from issuances of promissory notes and equity as described below. Cash Flows from Operating Activities We did not generate cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, or the year ended December 31, 2021. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, and the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities were 553,236 and 663,203, respectively. Cash Flows from Investing Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, and the year ended December 31, 2021, no cash flows were provided by or used in investing activities. Cash Flows from Financing Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, and the year ended December 31, 2021, 465,000 and 889,851, respectively, in net cash was provided by financing activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, and year ended December 31, 2021, 300,000 and 365,000, respectively, in cash was provided by notes payable, and 165,000 and 570,005, respectively, in net cash was provided by sales of common stock. 10 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Critical Accounting Policies Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in the accompanying financial statements include the amortization period for intangible assets, valuation and impairment valuation of intangible assets, depreciable lives of the web site and property and equipment, valuation of warrant and beneficial conversion feature debt discounts, valuation of share-based payments and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. Investments in Equity We measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. We use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of equity securities with readily determinable fair values.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Genvor Incorporated as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and year ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the entity will continue as a going concern.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Genvor Incorporated in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

Genvor Incorporated is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ We have served as Genvor Incorporated s auditor since 2020. March 28, 2023 Turner, Stone Company, L.L.P.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company recognized a net loss of and had net cash used in operating activities of , with no revenues earned, and limited operational history. These matters, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. While the Company is currently developing its products and technologies, the Company s cash position may not be significant enough to support the Company s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of additional public and/or private offerings of its stock. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan, develop its products and technologies, and generate revenues should provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds in the future, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement its business plan and generate cash flows from financing activities or operating activities. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

Payable for Patent On August 22, 2020, the Company s subsidiary, Genvor Inc., completed an acquisition of Agromed LLC Agromed in a transaction accounted for under the asset purchase method of accounting, whereby the assets acquired and the liabilities, if any assumed, are to be valued at fair value, and compared to the fair value of the consideration given to identify if there are any identifiable intangible assets to be recognized as a result of the transaction. Based on ASC 805, the Company first performed a screen test; determining that substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset. Agromed only held one patent and two applications for patents and had no sales, employees, or customers as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, the assets acquired are not considered a business and the recorded cost of the acquisition was based upon the fair value of the assets acquired.

As a result, the Company is no longer honoring the agreement to pay 150,000 but decided to let the seller retain the shares.

F-15 Table of Contents shares of Company common stock issued to Old Genvor s pre-merger stockholders). Pursuant to the original Acquisition agreement and Merger, the Company s founding shareholders retained of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock, or shares (Note 4). After closing the Acquisition and for a period of two years following commencement of trading of the Company s common stock, the Company and Old Genvor agreed that the Company will make additional issuances of the Company s common stock to the founding shareholders to ensure that in the aggregate they maintain their 5 ownership of the Company s outstanding common stock. Pursuant to business combination accounting for reverse acquisitions, the Company accounted for the Merger as a capital transaction (reverse recapitalization) rather than a business combination (or asset acquisition). Since the Company was formerly a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) with no assets and only expenses related to maintaining its public shell company status, and Old Genvor has cash, other assets, a contract with the USDA (Note 6), and has raised funds from investors, Old Genvor was determined to be the accounting acquirer. Because a reverse recapitalization is equivalent to the issuance of shares by the private operating company for the net monetary assets of the public shell company, the transaction costs incurred by Old Genvor to effect the recapitalization were recognized as a reduction in additional paid-in capital rather than expensed as incurred. The assets and liabilities of Old Genvor were consolidated with the Company at their book value, the equity accounts were retroactively adjusted to reflect the equity of the Company, with a balancing adjustment through the additional paid-in capital account.

Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure We have had no disagreements with our accountants required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 304 of Regulation S-K. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Based upon such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as required under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The management of the Company is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and related financial information appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The financial statements and notes have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The management of the Company is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. A company's internal control over financial reporting is defined as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the board of directors of the Company; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial officer, does not expect that the Company's disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. With the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, based upon the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013. Based on that evaluation, our management has concluded that, as of September 30, 2022, the Company had material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting and the Company s internal control over financial reporting were not effective. Specifically, management identified the following material weaknesses at September 30, 2022: 1. Lack of oversight by independent directors in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; 13 Table of Contents 2. Lack of functioning audit committee, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; 3. Insufficient personnel resources within the accounting function to segregate the duties over financial transaction processing and reporting and to allow for proper monitoring controls over accounting; 4. Insufficient written policies and procedures over accounting transaction processing and period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. To remediate our internal control weaknesses, management intends to implement the following measures: The Company will add sufficient number of independent directors to the board and appoint an audit committee. The Company will add sufficient knowledgeable accounting personnel to properly segregate duties and to effect a timely, accurate preparation of the financial statements. Upon the hiring of additional accounting personnel, the Company will develop and maintain adequate written accounting policies and procedures. The additional hiring is contingent upon the Company's efforts to obtain additional funding through equity or debt for its continued operational activities and corporate expenses. Management provides no assurances that it will be able to do so. We understand that remediation of material weaknesses and deficiencies in internal controls are a continuing work in progress due to the issuance of new standards and promulgations. However, remediation of any known deficiency is among our highest priorities. Our management will periodically assess the progress and sufficiency of our ongoing initiatives and make adjustments as and when necessary. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide, and this annual report does not include, an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Except as set forth above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls The Company's management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. Further, the design of the control system must reflect that there are resource constraints and that the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Item 9B. Other Information. None. 14 Table of Contents PART III Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.

Our directors are elected at the annual meeting of the shareholders, with vacancies filled by the Board of Directors, and serve until their successors are elected and qualified, or their earlier resignation or removal. Officers are appointed by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors or until their earlier resignation or removal. Any action required can be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation which may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if consent of consents in writing setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of the outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office, its principle place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which the proceedings of meetings are recorded. As we have recently devoted efforts to exploring the intersection of technology and wholistic technology-based health treatments for a variety of mental health conditions, from autism to dementia and Alzheimer s, we have also retained Board of Advisors composed of advisors we believe are competent to advise us regarding technology, sports health issues and treatments, and PTSD. Indemnification of Directors and Officers Section 78.138 of the Nevada Revised Statutes ("NRS") provides that a director or officer will not be individually liable unless it is proven that (i) the director's or officer's acts or omissions constituted a breach of his or her fiduciary duties, and (ii) such breach involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of the law. Section 78.7502 of NRS permits a company to indemnify its directors and officers against expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with a threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding if the officer or director (i) is not liable pursuant to NRS 78.138 or (ii) acted in good faith and in a manner the officer or director reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, if a criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct of the officer or director was unlawful. Section 78.751 of NRS permits a Nevada company to indemnify its officers and directors against expenses incurred by them in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding as they are incurred and in advance of final disposition thereof, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the officer or director to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such officer or director is not entitled to be indemnified by the company. Section 78.751 of NRS further permits the company to grant its directors and officers additional rights of indemnification under its articles of incorporation or bylaws or otherwise. Section 78.752 of NRS provides that a Nevada company may purchase and maintain insurance or make other financial arrangements on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the company, or is or was serving at the request of the company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, for any liability asserted against him and liability and expenses incurred by him in his capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the company has the authority to indemnify him against such liability and expenses. Our Articles of Incorporation provide that no director or officer of the Company will be personally liable to the Company or any of its stockholders for damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer; provided, however, that the foregoing provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director or officer (i) for acts or omissions which involve intentional misconduct, fraud or knowing violation of law, or (ii) the payment of dividends in violation of Section 78.300 of NRS. In addition, our Bylaws implement the indemnification and insurance provisions permitted by Chapter 78 of the NRS by providing that the Company shall indemnify its directors to the fullest extent permitted by the NRS and may, if and to the extent authorized by the board of directors, so indemnify its officers and any other person whom it has the power to indemnify against liability, reasonable expense or other matter whatsoever; and the Company may at the discretion of the board of directors purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who holds or who has held any position identified in the paragraph above against any and all liability incurred by such person in any such position or arising out of his status as such. 16 Table of Contents Insofar as indemnification by us for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling the company pursuant to provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification by such director, officer or controlling person of us in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being offered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. Director Compensation During the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not have an independent director. Directors that were employees were not paid any fees for their role as director. Involvement on Certain Material Legal Proceedings During the Last Five Years No director, officer, significant employee or consultant has been convicted in a criminal proceeding, exclusive of traffic violations. No bankruptcy petitions have been filed by or against any business or property of any director, officer, significant employee or consultant of the Company nor has any bankruptcy petition been filed against a partnership or business association where these persons were general partners or executive officers. No director, officer, significant employee or consultant has been permanently or temporarily enjoined, barred, suspended or otherwise limited from involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities. No director, officer or significant employee has been convicted of violating a federal or state securities or commodities law. Directors' and Officers' Liability Insurance The Company does not have directors' and officers' liability insurance insuring our directors and officers against liability for acts or omissions in their capacities as directors or officers. Code of Ethics We intend to adopt a code of ethics that applies to our officers, directors and employees, including our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer, but have not done so to date due to our relatively small size. We intend to adopt a written code of ethics in the near future. Corporate Governance and Board Independence Our Board of Directors consists of three directors and has not established a Nominating or Governance Committees as standing committees. The Board does not have an executive committee or any committees performing a similar function. We are not currently listed on a national securities exchange or in an inter-dealer quotation system that has requirements that a majority of the board of directors be independent. Due to our lack of operations and size, and since we are not currently listed on a national securities exchange, we are not subject to any listing requirements mandating the establishment of any particular committees; all functions of a nominating/governance committee were performed by our whole board of directors. Our board of directors intends to appoint such persons and form such committees as are required to meet the corporate governance requirements imposed by the national securities exchanges as necessary. Our board of directors does not believe that it is necessary to have such committees at the early stage of the company's development, and our board of directors believes that the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by the members of our board of directors. 17 Table of Contents We believe that our board of directors is capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. We believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an "audit committee financial expert" would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development and the fact that we have not generated any material revenues to date. Board Leadership Structure and the Board's Role in Risk Oversight. The Board of Directors is led by a Chairman and at this time, our Chairman is also our Chief Executive Officer. Although our sole officer is our sole director, the Board believes that the most effective leadership structure at this time is not to separate the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. A combined structure provides the Company with a single leader who represents the company to our stockholders, regulators, business partners and other stakeholders, among other reasons set forth below. This structure creates efficiency in the preparation of the meeting agendas and related Board materials as the Company's Chief Executive Officer works directly with those individuals preparing the necessary Board materials and is more connected to the overall daily operations of the Company. Agendas are also prepared with the permitted input of the full Board of Directors allowing for any concerns or risks of any individual director to be discussed as deemed appropriate. The Board believes that the Company has benefited from this structure, and Mr. Perry's continuation in the combined role of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is in the best interest of the stockholders. The Company believes that the combined structure is necessary and allows for efficient and effective oversight, given the Company's relatively small size, its corporate strategy and focus. The Board of Directors does not have a specific role in risk oversight of the Company. The Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers and employees of the Company provide the Board of Directors with information regarding the Company's risks. 18 Table of Contents Item 11. Executive Compensation The table below sets forth, for our last two fiscal years ending September 30, 2022 2022 and December 31, 2021 2021 ), the compensation earned by our executive officers and former executive officers.
