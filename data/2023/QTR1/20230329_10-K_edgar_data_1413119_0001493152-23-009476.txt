Overview 

Kraig
Biocraft Laboratories, Inc., a Wyoming corporation, is a corporation organized to develop high strength fibers using recombinant DNA
technology for commercial applications in technical textile. We use genetically engineered silkworms that produce spider silk proteins
to create our recombinant spider silk. Applications include performance apparel, workwear, filtration, luxury fashion, flexible composites,
medical implants, cosmetics and more. We believe that we have been a leader in the research and development of commercially scalable
and cost effective spider silk for technical textile and non-fibrous applications. Our primary proprietary fiber technology includes
natural and engineered variants of spider silk produced in domesticated mulberry silkworms. Our business brings twenty-first century
biotechnology to the historical silk industry, permitting us to introduce materials with innovative properties and claims into an established
commercial ecosystem of silkworm rearing, silk spinning and weaving, and manufacture of garments and other products that can include
our specialty fibers and textiles. Specialty fibers are engineered for specific uses that require exceptional strength, flexibility,
heat resistance and/or chemical resistance. The specialty fiber market is exemplified by two synthetic fiber products that come from
petroleum derivatives: (1) aramid fibers; and (2) ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene fibers. The technical textile industry involves
products for both industrial and consumer products, such as filtration fabrics, medical textiles e.g. , sutures and artificial
ligaments), safety and protective clothing and fabrics used in military and aerospace applications (e.g., high-strength composite materials). 

We
are using genetic engineering technologies to develop fibers with greater strength, resiliency and flexibility for use in our target
markets, namely the specialty fiber and technical textile industries. We believe that the genetically engineered protein-based fibers
we seek to produce have properties that are in some ways superior to the materials currently available in the marketplace. Production
of our product in commercial quantities holds what we believe to be potential life-saving ballistic resistant material, which we believe
is lighter, thinner, more flexible, and tougher than steel. Other potential applications for spider silk based recombinant fibers include
use as structural material and for any application in which light weight and high strength are required. We believe that fibers made
with recombinant protein-based polymers will make significant inroads into the specialty fiber and technical textile markets. 

Through
our technologies, the introduction of the gene sequence based on those found in native spider silk, results in a germline transformation
and is therefore self-perpetuating. This technology is in essence a protein expression platform which has other potential applications
including diagnostics and pharmaceutical production. Moreover, our technologies are green inasmuch as our fibers and textiles
are derived from nature and do not use any petrochemicals as an input into the fibers. 

The
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm to our financial statements as of December 31, 2022 include an explanatory paragraph
stating that our net loss from operations and net capital deficiency at December 31, 2022 raise substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Recent
Developments 

In
August 2019, we received authorization from governmental authorities to begin rearing genetically enhanced silkworms at our production
facility in Vietnam. In October 2019, the Company delivered the first batch of these silkworms and began operations. These silkworms
served as the basis for the commercial expansion of our proprietary silk technology. On November 4, 2019, we reported that we had successfully
completed rearing the first batch of its transgenic silkworms at the Quang Nam production factory. Seasonal challenges in late December
2019 slowed production operations and governmental restrictions imposed due to the global COVID pandemic further delayed our operations
in 2020. In January of 2021 we received the first shipment of silk from our factory in Vietnam. We believe that we will be able to target
metric tons of capacity of our recombinant spider silk fiber per annum from this factory once it reaches maximum utilization. This capacity
will allow us to address initial demand for our products and materials for various applications in the protective, performance, and luxury
textile markets. 

In
January 2022, we completed production of the first Dragon Silk yarn produced entirely in Vietnam. The finished recombinant spider silk
yarn was spun from raw spider silk produced at Prodigy Textiles. We believe this production fully integrated Prodigy Textiles into Vietnam s
substantial silk textile industry. Vietnam produced nearly 1,000 metric tons of mundane silk in 2020 1 . While Prodigy Textiles
remains focused on ramping up the output of recombinant spider silk cocoons, these supporting vendors will play an essential role in
processing that silk into finished goods for a wide range of consumer markets. We plan to ship this Dragon Silk yarn to SpydaSilk Enterprises
in Singapore, a joint venture partially owned by the Company for weaving into fabrics and finished garments. The Company expects that
Prodigy Textiles will continue to leverage expanding silk production to address the material needs of SpydaSilk and make additional materials
available for purchase to fill the numerous and backlogged material requests it has received. 

On
July 15, 2022, we signed an agreement with Global Silk Solutions Joint Stock Company (GSS). Under this agreement, GSS will serve as a
contract manufacturer for the Company s recombinant spider silk. 

Strategic
Partnership 

On
November 23, 2020, we entered into a Strategic Partnership Agreement (the SPA with Mthemovement Kings Pte Ltd Kings ).
Kings is an eco-friendly luxury streetwear apparel line, part of the Kings Group of Companies and its affiliated companies. On January
25, 2021, the parties exchanged signatures for an amendment to the Agreement, which amended the procedures for termination of the SPA
to only allow for the termination of the SPA by mutual agreement of the Company and Kings following a consultation period of 120 (one
hundred and twenty) calendar days or such period as agreed otherwise between the parties (the Amendment , together
with the SPA, the Agreement ). 

Pursuant
to the Agreement, the parties have formed a joint venture to develop and sell the Company s spider silk fibers under the new innovative
apparel and fashion brand, trade named SpydaSilk and potential other trademarks to be announced. All intellectual property related
to SpydaSilk will be jointly owned by the Company and Kings. Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company granted the joint venture
and the SpydaSilk Enteprises Pte. Ltd. brand an exclusive geographic license to all the Company s technologies for the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations, in exchange for a 4-year firm commitment to purchase up to 32 million of the Company s raw recombinant
spider silk over the 4-year period, with an initial payment of 250,000 to the Company. Kings is projected to purchase an additional
 8 million of material in the fourth year and due to lags in production, the Company expects to extend the time period for the purchase
commitment, but there is no guarantee that SpydaSilk will agree to such extension or that such additional purchase will be made. Upon
commencement, in consideration for its ownership position in the joint venture, the Company shall issue 1,000,000 shares of its common
stock to Kings.

The
Agreement has a 60-month term, which can be terminated at any time by mutual agreement following a consultation period of 120 days, or
such other period as agreed by the parties. If applicable, the parties will honor their share of committed expenditures of the joint
venture and King will repay the Company any unused brand funds. 

Yorkville
Transaction 

On
January 18, 2022, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with YA II PN, LTD., a Cayman Islands exempt company Yorkville ),
pursuant to which Yorkville purchased secured convertible debentures (the Securities Purchase Agreement in the aggregate
principal amount of USD 3,000,000 (the Convertible Debentures ), which are convertible into shares of Common Stock (as converted,
the Conversion Shares ), of which a secured convertible debenture (the First Convertible Debenture in the
principal amount of 1,500,000 (the First Convertible Debenture Purchase Price shall be issued upon signing the Securities
Purchase Agreement and a secured convertible debenture (the Second Convertible Debenture, together with the First Convertible
Debenture, each a Convertible Debenture and collectively, the Convertible Debentures in the principal amount
of 1,500,000 (the Second Convertible Debenture Purchase Price shall be issued on or about the date that the Securities
and Exchange Commission declares the registration statement registering the shares of common stock underlying the notes effective (collectively,
the First Convertible Debenture Purchase Price and the Second Convertible Debenture Purchase Price shall collectively be referred to
as the Purchase Price (the Yorkville Transaction ). These additional funds, together with those from the
previously completed transactions we conducted with Yorkville between December 2020 and March 2021, account for an 8 million total Yorkville
investment; as of November 17, 2022, all debentures to Yorkville pursuant thereto have been satisfied. The Company also issued Yorkville
a warrant to purchase 12,500,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock, at an initial exercise price of 0.12 per share and a warrant
to purchase 4,285,714 shares of the Company s Common Stock, at an initial exercise price of 0.14 per share. The warrants have
a term of five (5) years and can be exercised via cashless exercise. If the Company issues or sells securities at a price less than the
applicable warrant exercise price, the exercise price of the applicable warrant shall be reduced to such lower price. The warrants also
have the same ownership cap as set forth in the Convertible Debentures, as described below. 

In
connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with Yorkville, pursuant
to which the Company agreed to register all of the shares of Common Stock underlying the Convertible Debentures and warrants and with
respect to subsequent registration statements, if any, such number of shares of Common Stock as requested by Yorkville not to exceed
300 of the maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all Convertible Debentures then outstanding (assuming
for purposes hereof that (x) such Convertible Debentures are convertible at the then current conversion price and (y) any such conversion
shall not take into account any limitations on the conversion of the Convertible Debentures set forth therein, in each case subject to
any cutbacks set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement. 

Upon
signing the letter of intent for the Yorkville Transaction, the Company paid 10,000 to an affiliate of Yorkville, for due diligence
and structuring. 

The
Securities Purchase Agreement also contained customary representation and warranties of the Company and the Investor, indemnification
obligations of the Company, termination provisions, and other obligations and rights of the parties. 

The
foregoing description of the Securities Purchase Agreement, Convertible Debentures, Warrant, Security Agreement, IP Security Agreement,
Registration Rights Agreement and Guaranty Agreement is qualified by reference to the full text of the forms of Securities Purchase Agreement,
Convertible Debenture and Warrant, which are filed as Exhibits hereto and incorporated herein by reference. 

Maxim
Group LLC received a cash placement agent fee of 230,000. 

Covid-19 

On
March 19, 2020, we furloughed non-essential staff in response to governmental regulations relating to COVID. This decision primarily
impacted staff at our fully owned subsidiary, Prodigy Textiles, in Vietnam and resulted in the temporary closing of silk rearing operations
at that facility. As of the date hereof, we have resumed silk production operations at the factory in Vietnam. The Company supported
its furloughed staff and paid their salaries during all mandatory closures. During the duration of the furlough, the Company s
CEO voluntarily waved the payment or accrual of his salary. The Company leveraged this forced closure time to improve its production
infrastructure based on the lessons learned from its operations. After the mandated closure, the Company has enhanced its production
operations with process automation, moved its production headquarters to a facility designed for silk production, created a more self-reliant
supply chain, and established a microbiology laboratory in its factory for enhanced quality control. The global COVID pandemic and government
regulations associated with the pandemic continue to evolve. We will continue to monitor the situation closely, including its potential
effect on our plans and timelines. 

Reverse
Stock Split Series A Voting Power 

In
2019, in order to facilitate a proposed uplisting to a national exchange, our stockholders approved a possible reverse stock split of
the Company s issued and outstanding Common Stock. However, the Board elected not to proceed with a reverse stock split. A significant
factor in that decision was our ability to access financing as described above without having to expend time and money on the uplisting
process. 

6 

The
Product 

Our
products exploit the unique characteristics of spider silk, specifically dragline silk from Nephila clavipes (golden orb-web spider)
and variants thereof. Such fibers possess unique mechanical properties in terms of strength, resilience and flexibility. Through the
use of genetic engineering, we believe that we have produced a variety of unique transgenic silkworm strains that produce recombinant
spider silk. Our recombinant spider silk fiber blends the silk proteins found in spider silk with the native silkworm silk proteins.
This approach allows for the cost-effective and eco-responsible production of spider silk at commercial production levels. 

Monster
Silk 

Monster
Silk was the first recombinant spider silk fiber product we developed. Monster Silk incorporates the natural elasticity of spider
silk to make a silk fiber which is more flexible that conventional silk fibers and textiles. We have produced sample products using Monster
Silk including knit fabrics, gloves, and shirts in collaboration with textile mills. We expect that Monster Silk will have
market applications across the traditional textile markets where its increased flexibility will provide increased durability and comfort. 

Dragon
Silk TM 

Dragon
Silk TM is the next evolution in recombinant spider silk, combining the elasticity of Monster Silk with additional high
strength elements of native spider silk. Some samples of Dragon Silk TM have demonstrated strength beyond that of native spider
silk. This combination of strength and elasticity results in a silk fiber which is soft and flexible, yet tougher than leading synthetic
fiber available on the market. Based on inquires we have received from end market leaders, we believe that Dragon Silk TM- will
have applications in performance apparel, durable workwear, luxury goods and apparel, and composites. 

Other
Products 

We
are continuing to develop new recombinant silks and other protein-based fibers and materials using our genetic engineering capabilities.
Our silkworm based knock-in knock-out production and development platform has significant advantages over our legacy technology which
created Dragon Silk and Monster Silk. Chief among these is the potential to produce spider silks with greatly increased purity and performance.
Due to the biocompatible and biodegradable properties of silk, we believe that the materials developed using this higher purity process
will create opportunities for products in the medical industry, including sutures, grafts, and implants. 

Our
Technology 

Our
technology builds upon the unique advantages of the domesticated silkworm. The silkworm is an efficient commercial and industrial producer
of protein based polymers, and forty percent (40 of the caterpillars weight is devoted to the silk glands. The silk glands produce
large amounts of an insoluble protein called fibroin, which the silkworm spins into a composite protein thread (silk). 

We
use our genetic engineering technology to create proprietary recombinant silk polymers from the silkworms. On September 29, 2010, we,
along with our collaborators at Notre Dame created approximately twenty different strains of transgenic silkworm which produce recombinant
silk polymers. In October of 2017, with the support of funding from the U.S. Army, we transitioned our research operations out of Notre
Dame and into our own research and development headquarters. 

Our
transgenic silkworms are created by inserting the genes expressing spider silk with either natural or engineered amino acid sequences
into the embryos of the silkworm. The spider silk sequence is introduced to the embryo of the silkworm and incorporated into the silkworm
genome using state of the art molecular biology approaches. The spider sequence is created on a circular loop of DNA called a plasmid.
We developed a method to alter the plasmid DNA to more readily allow the mixing and matching of various targeted traits including spider
DNA genes, disease resistance, commercially marketable proteins and other physical properties. In this way, we can combine different
genetic cassettes to create fibers and proteins with the desired chemical, physical, and mechanical properties more rapidly than through
conventional methods. 

7 

In
addition to this ability to easily mix and match DNA construction, we have also adapted new approaches to accelerate the rate we generate
new transgenic silkworms. Our initial approaches limited us to process silkworm eggs at a rate of roughly 50-200 a day, however, we have
developed approaches which allows us to process thousands of eggs a day. Utilizing both visual and non-visual genetic markers, we have
successfully developed methods to speed up the screening of potentially transgenic silkworms, which allows for rapid screening of transgenic
eggs. The eggs expressing the new spider silk constructs or other targeted properties are propagated while the eggs without the visual
marker are discarded, greatly increasing the efficiency of our screen for transgenic eggs. This new approach has been highly effective
in increasing the rate of development for new transgenics. We have employed this new procedure and have filed patent applications to
protect its use. 

We
utilize the latest advancements in molecular biology and genetic engineering to deliver targeted gene incorporations. The new constructs
are designed to integrate in the silkworm genome directly where the native silkworm silk is created. First made public in 2020, this
capability is designed for the full knock out and knock in replacement of the native silkworm heavy chain silk protein. We believe that
this increased expression and incorporation of the spider protein into the silkworm cocoon will lead to increased performance and open
the door for additional opportunities beyond fibers and textiles. 

Production
of this material in commercial quantities holds the potential of a life-saving ballistic resistant material, which is lighter, thinner,
more flexible, and tougher than steel. However, the Company does not currently have any life-saving ballistic products and could be some
time before we are able to produce such a product from the material. Other applications for spider silk based recombinant fibers include
use as structural material and for any application in which light weight and high strength are required. We believe that fibers made
with recombinant protein-based polymers will make significant inroads into the specialty fiber and technical textile markets. Our interactions
with manufacturers of high performance textiles, convince us that there is an eager commercial market for our innovative, sustainable,
and differentiated technology and products.

Manufacturing 

Our
spider silk technology is designed for easy plug and play incorporation into the existing silk production model. We manufacture and plan
to continue to manufacture our proprietary spider silk fibers using traditional silkworm production practices (sericulture). 

In
August 2019, we received authorization from Governmental authorities to begin rearing genetically enhanced silkworms at our production
facility in Quang Nam, Vietnam. In October 2019, we delivered the first batch of these silkworms and began operations. These silkworms
served as the basis for the commercial expansion of our proprietary silk technology. On November 4, 2019, we reported that we had successfully
completed rearing the first batch of our transgenic silkworms at the Quang Nam factory. Seasonal challenges in late December 2019 slowed
production operations and Governmental restrictions imposed due to the global COVID pandemic further delayed our operations in 2020.
In January of 2021, we received the first shipment of silk from our factory in Vietnam. We believe that we will be able to target metric
tons of capacity of our recombinant spider silk fiber per annum from our Vietnamese operations once we reach maximum utilization. This
capacity will allow us to address initial demand for our products and materials for various applications in the protective, performance,
and luxury textile markets. 

We
contract with local farmers to cultivate and harvest fresh mulberry for our operations. Prodigy Textiles has also established its own
mulberry rearing operations as part of our supply chain resilience program. Prodigy Textiles has hired local workers with experience
in sericulture production to care for and raise our silkworms through the five instars, or stages, of the silkworm life cycle, including
the final instar when the mature caterpillars produce a cocoon comprised of pure silk. These cocoons are then reeled to our specifications
to form the final recombinant spider silk threads such as Dragon Silk TM and Monster Silk . 

By
utilizing existing production methodology in traditional silk regions to produce our high performance materials, we leverage historical
knowledge, available labor and existing capital infrastructure for production, spinning, and weaving of our recombinant spider silk materials.
This approach reduces the risk to our manufacturing operations and decreases our need for upfront capital expenditure. 

Working with our contract manufacturer in Vietnam
we have identified robustness and acclimation of our silkworm strain to the local climate as the most significant challenges to production.
We are working to overcome these challenges by acclimating our silkworms to the local environment and accelerating the introduction of
our multi-strain hybrids. These efforts are targeted to increase overall robustness and cocoon size. 

We
believe that we will be able to target metric tons of capacity of recombinant spider silk fiber per annum from our operations in
Vietnam once we reach maximum utilization of our current facilities. This capacity will allow us to address our anticipated initial demand for applications
in the protective, performance, and luxury textile markets. 

On
March 19, 2020, we furloughed non-essential staff in response to governmental regulations relating to COVID. This decision primarily
impacted staff at our fully owned subsidiary, Prodigy Textiles, in Vietnam and resulted in the temporary closing of silk rearing operations
at that facility. As of the date hereof, we have resumed silk production operations at the factory in Vietnam. The Company supported
its furloughed staff and paid their salaries during all mandatory closures. During the duration of the furlough, the Company s
CEO voluntarily waved the payment or accrual of his salary. The Company leveraged this forced closure time to improve its production
infrastructure based on the lessons learned from its operations. After the mandated closure, the Company has enhanced its production
operations with process automation, moved its production headquarters to a facility designed for silk production, created a more self-reliant
supply chain, and established a microbiology laboratory in its factory for enhanced quality control. 

The
global COVID pandemic and government regulations associated with the pandemic continue to evolve. We will continue to monitor the situation
closely, including its potential effect on our plans and timelines. See, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak.

The
Market 

We
are focusing our work on the creation of new fibers with unique properties including fibers with potential high performance and technical
fiber applications for the performance fiber market. The performance fiber market is currently dominated by two classes of product: aramid
fibers, and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene fibers. These existing products serve the need for materials with high strength,
resilience, but are unable to delivery flexibility. Because these synthetic performance fibers are stronger and tougher than steel, they
are used in a wide variety of military, industrial, and consumer applications. 

The
military and police are among the users of performance fibers for its ballistic protection. The materials are also used for industrial
applications requiring superior strength and toughness, e.g., critical cables and abrasion/impact resistant components. Performance fibers
are also employed in safety equipment, high strength composite materials for the aero-space industry and for ballistic protection by
the defense industry. 

The
global market for technical textiles was estimated at greater than 184 billion in 2020 and projected to reach 250 billion by 2027 1 . 

These
are industrial materials which have become essential products for both industrial and consumer applications. The market for technical
textiles can be defined as consisting of: 

Medical
 textiles; 

Geotextiles; 

Textiles
 used in Defense and Military; 

Safe
 and Protective Clothing; 

Filtration
 Textiles; 

Textiles
 used in Transportation; 

Textiles
 used in Buildings; 

Composites
 with Textile Structure; and, 

Functional
 and Sportive Textiles. 

We
believe that the superior mechanical characteristics of the next generation of protein-based polymers (in other words, genetically engineered
silk fibers), will open up new applications for the technology. The materials which we are working to produce are many times tougher
and stronger than steel. 

We
are actively pursuing relationships within target end markets to secure product collaborations with key market channel leaders. Due to
the unique nature of our product, we received numerous unsolicited requests from leading businesses across a range of attractive end
markets requesting materials for applications development. This substantial demand for spider silk materials across the broad spectrum
of applications for high performance fibers and textiles, combined with the limited initial production capacity, has provided the opportunity
to be selective in choosing market channel partners best able to quickly bring our product to market at scale. We are working under non-disclosure
agreements to secure these collaborative development agreements and to establish limited channel exclusivity for firms we believe mirror
our culture of innovation. In January 2021 the Company entered into a partnership and exclusive purchase agreement worth up to 40 million
with M the Movement by Kings Group. This partnership will establish a jointly owned apparel and fashion brand headquarter in Singapore
focuses on sales to the ASEAN region.

Research
and Development 

In
2007, we entered into the first series of the Notre Dame Agreements to develop new transgenic silkworms. In 2010, we achieved our longstanding
goal of producing new silk fibers composed of recombinant proteins. In 2016, we received a contract from the U.S. Army to deliver the
first samples of its recombinant spider silk materials. In 2017, this contract was expanded to include research into the development
of stronger silk materials. As a result of that contract, the Company brought its research operations in-house, opening its own research
laboratories and expanding its scientific staff. This transition to in-house operations has led to a series of new technical breakthroughs
and is believed to have accelerated the pace of new development. We intend to turn its technology to the development and production of
high performance polymers . 

During
the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have spent approximately 10,375 hours and 9,505 hours, respectively, on research
and development activities, which consisted primarily of laboratory research on genetic engineering by our in-house research operations. 

As
of the date of this Report, our research and development efforts remain focused on growing our internal capabilities, but we may consider
renewing funding of the collaborative research and development of high strength polymers with Notre Dame or other joint development opportunities;
we have not had any formal discussions regarding any such collaborations. 

We
have initiated production of our recombinant materials including Monster Silk and Dragon Silk TM . Additionally, we plan
to accelerate both our microbiology and selective breeding programs, as well as providing more resources for their material and genetic
testing protocols in 2023. 

A key aspect of our research program is designed to target the biggest
immediate hurdle to production, the robustness of our silkworms within the large-scale production environment. Working with
our contract manufacture in Vietnam we have identified robustness and acclimation of our silkworm lines to the local climate as the most
significant challenge to production. Our research department has initiated, and we are accelerating a hybridization program, which is explicitly designed
to increase robustness and cocoon size. 

Our
Intellectual Property Approach 

Our
intellectual property strategy utilizes a blended approach of licensed technologies and in-house developments. As part of our intellectual
property portfolio, we have licensed the exclusive right to use certain patented gene-splicing technologies for use in silkworm. 

Under
the Notre Dame Agreements, we were issued and exercised our right to exclusive commercial use for spider silk technologies developed
under that agreement. We have worked collaboratively with the university to develop fibers with the mechanical characteristics of spider
silk. We are applying this proprietary genetic engineering technology to domesticated silkworms, which to our knowledge, is the only
proven commercially scaled system for producing silk. 

In
2017, we opened a research and development facility to expand on the work conducted at Notre Dame. Since opening this new facility, we
have expanded our intellectual property portfolio with multiple additional provisional and utility patent filings based on new discoveries
and inventions and made numerous advancements that have decreased the development time for new technologies, none of which rely on the
patented material from our collaboration with Notre Dame. We will continue to utilize this in-house research facility to expand and strengthen
its patent portfolio while also maintaining and growing its trade secret technologies approach to genetic advancement. We are actively
working to develop and patent new approaches to the development of genetically engineering silkworms, underlying construction techniques,
and fundamental genetic sequences for improved material performance. 

The
Notre Dame Agreements will last for the duration of the patented materials that we developed with Notre Dame. The new technologies that
we are developing in our internal research labs does not rely on the Notre Dame patented materials and as a result will not be impacted
by an expiration of those agreements. 

The
introduction of the gene sequence, in the manner employed by us, results in a germline transformation and is therefore self-perpetuating. 

License
Agreements/Intellectual Property 

We
have obtained certain rights to use a number of university created, and patented gene splicing and spider silk protein technologies. 

As
part of the joint development program with the University of Notre Dame and the Notre Dame Agreements, Kraig Labs negotiated an option
for exclusive global commercial rights to technologies jointly developed with Notre Dame. Kraig Labs has exercised that option. As of
the date of this filing, four patents relating to the jointly developed technologies have been issued, number 10-1926286 in South Korea,
number 2011314072 in Australia, number 26612 in Vietnam, and number 2,812,791 in Canada. These jurisdictions are a mix of silk producing
and consuming countries. We believe protecting our technologies in these countries will be beneficial to our future operations. 

In
addition to the patents related to licensed technologies from Notre Dame listed above, Kraig Labs has filed a number of patent applications
and provisional applications based on technologies developed solely within the Company s own laboratories. Kraig has filed two
such patent applications and four provisional patent applications based on technologies developed and discoveries from our own independent
research operations.

Notre
Dame Agreements 

As
discussed above, in 2007 we entered into the first series of Notre Dame Agreements. We provided financial support to ongoing research
and development of transgenic silkworms and the creation of recombinant silk fibers. In exchange, we have an option to obtain the exclusive
global commercialization rights to the technology developed pursuant to the research effort. 

Following
the first agreement, we entered into successive intellectual property and collaborative research agreements with Notre Dame to provide
different levels of financial support. The trend had been for an increase in financial support for the research and development in nearly
every successive agreement. In June 2012, we entered into an Intellectual Property / Collaborative Research Agreement with Notre Dame 2012 Notre Dame Research Agreement ). On March 4, 2015, we entered into a new Intellectual Property / Collaborative Research
Agreement with Notre Dame extending the agreement through March 2016 2015 Notre Dame Research Agreement ). Under the 2015
Notre Dame Research agreement, the Company provided approximately 534,000 in financial support. On September 20, 2015, the 2015 Notre
Dame Research Agreement was amended to increase the total funding by approximately 179,000; in February 2016, the 2015 Notre Dame Research
Agreement was extended to July 31, 2016 and in August 2016, the 2015 Notre Dame Research Agreement was extended to December 31, 2016.
In May 2017, the 2015 Notre Dame Research Agreement was amended to increase the total funding by approximately 189,000 and the duration
of the 2015 Notre Dame Research Agreement was extended to September 30, 2017. With the funding we received from the U.S. Army, we were
able to conduct our research and development in-house, at less cost, and therefore we did not extend the 2015 Notre Dame Research Agreement
after September 30, 2017, but in the future we may consider forming new collaborative research agreements. 

In
2011, we exercised our option to obtain the global commercialization rights to the technology developed under the Notre Dame Agreements,
which resulted in a separate license agreement with Notre Dame (the 2011 Notre Dame Agreement ). Pursuant to the 2011 Notre
Dame Agreement, Notre Dame filed an international patent application and numerous national patent applications on technology relating
to the creation and use of recombinant spider silks and we received exclusive and non-exclusive rights to certain spider silk and gene
splicing technologies including commercial rights with the right to sublicense such intellectual property. The 2011 Notre Dame Agreement
obligates us to reimburse Notre Dame for costs associated with the filing, prosecuting and maintaining of such patents and patent applications.
In exchange for the rights to commercialization, Notre Dame has received 2,200,000 shares of our Common Stock and we have agreed to pay
Notre Dame royalties equal to 2 of our gross sales of the licensed products and 10 of any sublicensing fees received by the Company
on licensed technology. We have also agreed to pay to Notre Dame 50,000 a year, which will be reduced from the total amount of royalties
paid in the same year. The 50,000 payment to Notre Dame is not owed for any year in which the Company is sponsoring research within
Notre Dame. 

Cooperative
Agreement in Vietnam 

On
December 30, 2015, we entered into a cooperative agreement with a provincial government office in Vietnam for the research and pilot
production of hybrid silkworms. In April 2018, we received our investment registration certificate for our facility in Vietnam. Later
that month the Company was issued its ERC so that it could begin operations in Vietnam. We have established a subsidiary in Vietnam which
is currently producing our recombinant spider silk in small quantities. Management believes the ERC puts the Company on a path to scale
at a much greater level by harnessing existing silk production infrastructure with the capacity to match the existing demand for their
spider silk materials. 

13 

Other
Agreements 

On
October 15, 2013, we entered into an intellectual property agreement with a scientific researcher relating to the development of new
recombinant silk fibers. Under the terms of that agreement, the scientific researcher transferred his rights of intellectual property,
inventions and trade secrets which the researcher develops relating to recombinant silk to us. Upon signing, the researcher received
8,000,000 common stock purchase warrants from the Company, exercisable 24 months from the date of the agreement. As per the terms of
the agreement, the researcher received an additional 10,000,000 warrants after creating a new recombinant silk fiber for us that met
specified performance characteristics and another 8,000,000 warrants for performing the contract in good faith. The warrants described
above all contain a cashless exercise provision and are exercisable on the 24-month anniversary of the date on which they were issuable
under the agreement. 

Governmental
Regulations 

We
are subject to U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as Vietnam central, provisional, and district laws and regulations.
These laws and regulations govern, among other things, labor relations, the labeling and safety of the products we sell, the methods
we use to sell these products and/or the production of the products we sell. We believe that we are in material compliance with all such
applicable laws and regulations, although no assurance can be provided that this will remain true in the future. Laws and their interpretations
can change. With regards to areas where law is vague, lacking, or could be subject to interpretation we endeavor to conform to wide spread industry
norms. 

Environment 

Kraig
Labs is fully committed to its vision of bringing spider silk technologies to commercial markets while maintaining the highest levels
of environmental responsibility. We believe our technology, built on a renewable resource, has a positive environmental impact and offers
significant benefits over competing synthetic textiles. Our production system is derived from nature and does not use any petrochemicals
as an input into our fibers. 

We
seek to comply with and exceed all applicable statutory and administrative requirements concerning environmental quality. Expenditures
for compliance with federal state and local environmental laws have not had, and are not expected to have, a material effect on our capital
expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. 

While
being environmentally conscious is the objective of all producers in this industry, the fermentation process used by our competitors
produces high levels of carbon dioxide. CO2 is a greenhouse gas and is argued to be the leading cause of global warming. In stark contrast,
Kraig Labs mulberry trees and the silk from silkworms have proven to be effective at sequestering carbon dioxide and are renewable
resources. Mulberry trees are also very low maintenance, while still providing essential global green-cover and significantly help in
reducing soil erosion in areas. 

In
addition to climate impacts of the fermentation approach, solvents typically used to wet-spin fibers can have significant environmental
impacts. DMSO, a common wet-spinning solvent, can be absorbed directly through human skin, carrying with it potentially dangerous side
effects. This is another reason we pride ourselves on the use of silkworms, which do not require the use of DMSO, to produce our products. 

Competition 

We
compete directly with numerous other companies with similar product lines and/or distribution that have extensive capital, resources,
market share, and brand recognition. 

There
are presently three primary competitors that we face in our industry, but there are few barriers to entry in our industry. This creates
the strong possibility of new competitors emerging, and of others succeeding in developing the same or similar fibers for application
that we are trying to develop. The effects of this increased competition may be materially adverse to us and our stockholders. As this
is an emergent industry there is no one producer that has captured a significant portion of the market. Bolt Threads, Inc. based in California
and Spiber Inc. based in Japan are competitors which have raised the largest amounts of investment capital to date. We also compete with
AMSilk, which is based in Germany. We believe that our technology offers more cost-effective methods with lower environmental impact
than technologies used by our identified competitors, however, new technologies could be developed that remove this advantage. 

14 

These
competitors have raised and spent 100 s of millions of dollars in pursuit of the same results that we have achieved, but through
different and more complex means. The Company believes that its competitors will continue to overspend while struggling to deliver the
results that we have been able to achieve utilizing the existing global infrastructure. 

Based
on our research and internal assessments, the following chart illustrates why we believe we have a competitive advantage over our three
main, known competitors: 

Employees 

The
Company currently employs between 8-11 people at its U.S. facilities, 6 full-time and up to 5 part-time, including Kim Thompson, our
officer and sole director and Jonathan R. Rice, our Chief Operating Officer. The Company employs between 8-30 full time personnel at
its Vietnamese subsidiary depending on the production cycle. We plan to hire more persons on as-needed basis.

Our
principal executive office is located at 2723 South State St., Suite 150, Ann Arbor, Michigan. We pay an annual rent of 2,508 for conference
facilities, mail, fax, and reception services located at this location. 

On
January 23, 2017, we signed an 8-year property lease with the Kim Thompson, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President,
sole director, and controlling shareholder, for land in Texas where the Company grows its mulberry, at a monthly rent of 960. We ended
this lease agreement on April 5, 2021. 

On
May 9, 2019, we signed a 5-year property lease for 4,560.57 square meters of space in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam at a rent of
approximately 91,791 in each of year one and two and with a 5 increase per year for years three through five. On August 1, 2021, the

Overview 

Kraig
Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. is a corporation organized under the laws of Wyoming on April 25, 2006. Kraig Labs was organized to develop
high strength fibers using recombinant DNA technology for commercial applications in technical textile. We use genetically engineered
silkworms that produce spider silk proteins to create our recombinant spider silk. Applications include performance apparel, workwear,
filtration, luxury fashion, flexible composites, medical implants, cosmetics and more. We believe that we have been a leader in the research
and development of commercially scalable and cost-effective spider silk for technical textile and non-fibrous applications. Our primary
proprietary fiber technology includes natural and engineered variants of spider silk produced in domesticated mulberry silkworms. Our
business brings twenty-first century biotechnology to the historical silk industry, permitting us to introduce materials with innovative
properties and claims into an established commercial ecosystem of silkworm rearing, silk spinning and weaving, and manufacture of garments
and other products that can include our specialty fibers and textiles. Specialty fibers are engineered for specific uses that require
exceptional strength, flexibility, heat resistance and/or chemical resistance. The specialty fiber market is exemplified by two synthetic
fiber products that come from petroleum derivatives: (1) aramid fibers; and (2) ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene fibers. The
technical textile industry involves products for both industrial and consumer products, such as filtration fabrics, medical textiles e.g. , sutures and artificial ligaments), safety and protective clothing and fabrics used in military and aerospace applications
(e.g., high-strength composite materials). 

We
are using genetic engineering technologies to develop fibers with greater strength, resiliency and flexibility for use in our target
markets, namely the specialty fiber and technical textile industries. 

In
2020, we developed a new technology platform, based on a non-CRISPR Cas9 gene editing knock-in knock-out technology. This is our first
knock-in knock-out technology which we are now using for the development of advanced materials. This system is built on our eco-friendly
and cost-effective silkworm production system, which we believe is more advanced than current competing methods. Knock-in knock-out technology
allows for the targeting of specific locations and genetic traits for modification, addition, and removal. This capability should allow
us to accelerate new product developments and bring products to market more quickly. This capability also allows for genetic trait modifications
that were previously impractical, creating opportunities for products outside of silk fibers and increased flexibility in production
location. 

Based
on our internal analysis, management believes that this new platform technology will allow us to outpace and surpass Dragon Silk, a fiber
that we developed with our previous tools. Samples of Dragon Silk have already demonstrated to be tougher than many fibers used in bullet
proof vests. We expect that this new approach will yield materials beyond those capabilities based upon its potential for significantly
improved purity. 

22 

In
August 2019, we received authorization from governmental authorities to begin rearing genetically enhanced silkworms at our production
facility in Vietnam. In October 2019, the Company delivered the first batch of these silkworms and began operations. These silkworms
served as the basis for the commercial expansion of our proprietary silk technology. On November 4, 2019, we reported that we had successfully
completed rearing the first batch of its transgenic silkworms at the Quang Nam production factory. Seasonal challenges in late December
2019 slowed production operations and governmental restrictions imposed due to the global COVID pandemic further delayed our operations
in 2020. In January of 2021 we received the first shipment of silk from our factory in Vietnam. We believe that we will be able to target
metric tons of capacity of our recombinant spider silk fiber per annum from this factory once it reaches maximum utilization. This capacity
will allow us to address initial demand for our products and materials for various applications in the protective, performance, and luxury
textile markets. 

On
November 23, 2020, we entered into a Strategic Partnership Agreement (the SPA with Mthemovement Kings Pte Ltd Kings ).
Kings is an eco-friendly luxury streetwear apparel line, part of the Kings Group of Companies and its affiliated companies. On January
25, 2021, the parties exchanged signatures for an amendment to the Agreement, which amended the procedures for termination of the SPA
to only allow for the termination of the SPA by mutual agreement of the Company and Kings following a consultation period of 120 (one
hundred and twenty) calendar days or such period as agreed otherwise between the parties (the Amendment , together
with the SPA, the Agreement ). 

Pursuant
to the Agreement, the parties formed a joint venture, Spydasilk Enterprises Pte. Ltd., to develop and sell the Company s spider
silk fibers under the new innovative apparel and fashion brand, trade named SpydaSilk and potential other trademarks to be announced.
All intellectual property related to SpydaSilk will be jointly owned by the Company and Kings. 

Under
the terms of the Agreement, the Company granted the joint venture and the SpydaSilk brand an exclusive geographic license to all the
Company s technologies for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, in exchange for a 4-year firm commitment to purchase up
to 32 million of the Company s raw recombinant spider silk over the 4-year period, with an initial payment of 250,000 to the
Company. Kings is projected to purchase an additional 8 million of material in the fourth year, but there is no guarantee that such
additional purchase will be made. 

In
consideration for its ownership position in the joint venture, the Company shall issue 1,000,000 shares of its common stock to Kings.
The Agreement has a 60-month term, which can be terminated at any time by mutual agreement following a consultation period of 120 days,
or such other period as agreed by the parties. If applicable, the parties will honor their share of committed expenditures of the joint
venture and King will repay the Company any unused brand funds. 

The
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm to our financial statements as of December 31, 2022 includes an explanatory paragraph
stating that our net loss from operations and net capital deficiency at December 31, 2022 raise substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Plan
of Operations 

During
the next twelve months, we expect to take the following steps in connection with the further development of our business and the implementation
of our plan of operations: 

We plan to expand our research and development to accelerate our work in creating next generation materials and to improve the robustness
of our recombinant spider silk lines. 

We
 plan to develop a line of fabrics and apparel under a joint venture with Kings to create a line of fashion wear under Spydasilk Enterprises
 Pte. Ltd., with trade names including Spydasilk TM , Spydra TM and others. 

We
 plan to continue the expansion of our production operations at our facilities in Quang Nam, Vietnam in accordance with our investment
 and enterprise registration certificates, including the planting of additional mulberry fields in collaboration with local farming
 cooperatives and the hiring of additional direct staff for our factory, as needed. 

We plan to overcome the current bottleneck in production by improving the
overall robustness of our recombinant spider silk lines through a combination of climate acclimation and implementation of a multiple-strain
hybrid breeding program. This program has already been initiated and is being rapidly accelerated. 

We
 plan to accelerate both our microbiology and selective breeding programs, as well as provide more resources for our material testing
 protocols. We spent approximately 177,000 over the last 12 months on research and development of high strength polymers. In 2022,
 we directed our research and development efforts on growing our internal capabilities; we plan to continue to dedicate our efforts
 in 2023 to grow our internal research and development programs. 

23 

We
 will consider buying an established revenue producing company in a compatible business, in order to broaden our financial base and
 facilitate the commercialization of our products; as of the date hereof, we have not had any formal discussion or entered into any
 definitive agreements regarding any such purchase. 

We
 will also actively consider pursuing collaborative research opportunities with private laboratories in areas of research which overlap
 the company s existing research and development. One such potential area for collaborative research which the company is considering
 is protein expression platforms. If our financing allows, management will strongly consider increasing the breadth of our research
 to include protein expression platform technologies. 

We
 plan to actively pursue collaborative research and product testing opportunities with companies in the biotechnology, materials,
 textile and other industries. 

We
 plan to actively pursue additional collaborative commercialization, marketing and manufacturing opportunities with companies in the
 textile and material sectors for the fibers we developed and for any new polymers that we create in 2023 and going forward. 

We
 plan to actively pursue the development of commercial scale production of our recombinant materials including Monster Silk ,
 Dragon Silk TM , Spydasilk TM , and Spydra TM 

Limited
Operating History 

We
have not previously demonstrated that we will be able to expand our business through an increased investment in our research and development
efforts. We cannot guarantee that the research and development efforts described in this filing will be successful. Our business is subject
to risks inherent in growing an enterprise, including limited capital resources, risks inherent in the research and development process
and possible rejection of our products in development. 

If
financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue our research and development and other operations. Equity
financing will result in dilution to existing stockholders. 

Impact
of COVID-19 Outbreak 

On
January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern 
and on March 10, 2020, declared it to be a pandemic. Actions taken around the world to help mitigate the spread of the coronavirus include
restrictions on travel, and quarantines in certain areas, and forced closures for certain types of public places and businesses. The
coronavirus and actions taken to mitigate it have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on the economies and financial
markets of many countries, including the geographical area in which the Company operates. While the closures and limitations on movement,
domestically and internationally, are expected to be temporary, if the outbreak continues the duration of the supply chain disruption
could reduce the availability, or result in delays, of materials or supplies to and from the Company, which in turn could materially
interrupt the Company s business operations. Given the speed and frequency of the continuously evolving developments with respect
to this pandemic, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the magnitude of the impact to its consolidated results of operations. We have
taken every known precaution possible to ensure the safety of our employees.

On
March 19, 2020, we furloughed non-essential staff in response to governmental regulations relating to COVID. This decision primarily
impacted staff at our fully owned subsidiary, Prodigy Textiles, in Vietnam and resulted in the temporary closing of silk rearing operations
at that facility. As of the date hereof, we have resumed silk production operations at the factory in Vietnam. The Company supported
its furloughed staff and paid their salaries during all mandatory closures. During the duration of the furlough, the Company s
CEO voluntarily waved the payment or accrual of his salary. The Company leveraged this forced closure time to improve its production
infrastructure based on the lessons learned from its operations. After the mandated closure, the Company has enhanced its production
operations with process automation, moved its production headquarters to a facility designed for silk production, created a more self-reliant
supply chain, and established a microbiology laboratory in its factory for enhanced quality control. On October 24, 2020, silk production
operations at the factory resumed. 

The
global COVID pandemic and government regulations associated with the pandemic continue to evolve. We will continue to monitor the situation
closely, including its potential effect on our plans and timelines. The actions of governments in response to COVID, both domestic and
foreign, have impacted our ability to transport goods, people, essential equipment, and other items essential to our production. In turn,
these restrictions are impacting our ability to produce intermediate and end products and are delaying our timelines for commercialization
and revenue. 

Additionally,
it is reasonably possible that estimates made in the financial statements have been, or will be, materially and adversely impacted in
the near term as a result of these conditions, including losses on inventory; impairment losses related to goodwill and other long-lived
assets and current obligations. 

Note
Financing 

December
2020 

On
December 11, 2020, the Company issued a 1,000,000, thirteen-month (13), unsecured, convertible note, which was due and paid on January
11, 2022. The convertible note had an interest at 10 , with a 5 original issue discount 50,000), resulting in net proceeds of 950,000.
The note contained a discount to market feature, whereby, the lender was able to purchase stock at 90 of the lowest trading price for
a period of ten (10) days preceding the conversion date. As a result, we issued approximately 15,000,000 shares upon conversion of the
note. Additionally, the Company issued 3,125,000 five-year (5) warrants to the note holder. The warrants had a fair value of 2,599,066,
based upon using a black-scholes option pricing model.

Net
Revenues : During the year ended December 31, 2022, we realized 0 of revenues from our business. During the year ended December 31,
2021, we realized 0 of revenues from our business. Accordingly, there was no change in revenues between the years ended December 31,
2022 and 2021. 

Research
and development expenses : During year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred 176,431 research and development expenses. During year
ended December 31, 2021, we incurred 197,745 of research and development expenses, a decrease of 21,314 or 10.78 compared with the
same period in 2021. The research and development expenses are attributable to the research and development with the Notre Dame University;
the decrease was due to the timing of research related activity and costs by insources the Company s research operations. 

Professional
Fees: During year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred 339,710 professional expenses, which increased by 12,728 or 3.89 from 326,982
for year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in professional fees expense was attributable to increased expenses related to investor
relations services during year ended December 31, 2022. 

Officers
Salary: During year ended December 31, 2022, officers salary expenses increased to 779,742 or 6.17 compared to 734,427
for year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is due to contractual terms of employment. 

General
and Administrative Expense : General and administrative expenses decreased by 671,265 or 44.85 to 825,460 for year ended December
31, 2022 from 1,496,725 for year ended December 31, 2021. Our general and administrative expenses for year ended December 31, 2022 consisted
of other general and administrative expenses (which includes expenses such as Auto, Business Development, SEC Filing, Investor Relations,
General Office, warrant Compensation) of 416,221, Travel of 25,231, office salary of 259,008, and consulting of 80,000 for a total
of 825,460. Our general and administrative expenses for year ended December 31, 2021 consisted of other general and administrative expenses
(which includes expenses such as Auto, Business Development, SEC Filing, Investor Relations, General Office, warrant Compensation) of
 856,158, Travel of 13,957, office salary of 266,190 for a total of 1,496,725. The primary reason for the decrease in general and
administrative expenses comparing the year ended December 31, 2022 to the corresponding period for 2021 was mainly due to warrants issuances
and consulting expenses. 

Rent
 Related Party: During the year ended December 31 2022, rent-related party expense decreased to 0 or 0 compared to 3,683
for the year ended December 31, 2021. The rent-related party expense was attributable to the Company
signing an eight-year property lease with the Company s President on January 23, 2017. On April 5, 2021, the Company ended this
lease agreement with its President resulting in the decrease. 

Interest
Expense : Interest expense decreased to 609,129, or 7.77 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 660,419 for the year ended
December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to interest on the related party loans and accounts payable and accrued expenses to
the related parties. 

Net
Change in Unrealized Depreciation on Investment in Gold Bullion : Net change in unrealized appreciation on investment in gold bullion
increased by 13,042 to 38 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from depreciation of 13,004 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The
increase was primarily due to a net change in unrealized depreciation on investment in gold bullion. 

Amortization
of original issue and debt discounts : Amortization of original issue and debt discount decreased to 1,111,580, or 76.36 for the
year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 4,702,918 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to amortization
of original issue and debt discounts on convertible loans. 

28 

Net
Loss : Net loss decreased by 4,203,789, or 52.25 , to a net loss of 3,842,014 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from a net loss
of 8,045,803 for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease in net loss was driven primarily by a decrease in warrant compensation,
amortization of original issue discount and general administrative fees and slightly offset by an increase in officer s salary
expense. 

Capital
Resources and Liquidity 

Our
financial statements have been presented on the basis that we have a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As presented in the financial statements, we incurred a net loss of 3,842,014
during the year ended December 31, 2022, and losses are expected to continue in the near term. The accumulated deficit is 46,657,000
at December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 2 for our discussion of stockholder deficit. We have been funding our operations through private
loans and the sale of common stock in private placement transactions. Refer to Note 6 and Note 7 in the financial statements for our
discussion of notes payable and shares issued, respectively. Our cash resources are insufficient to meet our planned business objectives
without additional financing. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying
financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of
assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of our company to continue as a going
concern. 

Management
anticipates that significant additional expenditures will be necessary to develop and expand our business before significant positive
operating cash flows can be achieved. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital
and to ultimately achieve sustainable revenues and profitable operations. At December 31, 2022, we had 3,862,716 of cash on hand. These
funds are insufficient to complete our business plan and as a consequence, we will need to seek additional funds, primarily through the
issuance of debt or equity securities for cash to operate our business. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available
or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to us. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, it may contain
undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of
equity financing. 

Management
has undertaken steps as part of a plan to improve operations with the goal of sustaining our operations for the next twelve months and
beyond. These steps include (a) raising additional capital and/or obtaining financing; (b) controlling overhead and expenses; and (c)
executing material sales or research contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company can successfully accomplish these steps and
it is uncertain that the Company will achieve a profitable level of operations and obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance
that any additional financing will be available to the Company on satisfactory terms and conditions, if at all. As of the date of this
Report, we have not entered into any formal agreements regarding the above. 

In
the event the Company is unable to continue as a going concern, the Company may elect or be required to seek protection from its creditors
by filing a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or may be subject to an involuntary petition in bankruptcy. To date, management has not
considered this alternative, nor does management view it as a likely occurrence.

convertible notes payable, net of 3,670,000, 50,000 loan repayment and proceeds from a warrant exercise for 266,332. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States GAAP ). GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations
of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, and revenue and expense amounts reported. These estimates can
also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial
condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively
applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant
estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements. 

Our
significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of our financial statements. While all these significant accounting policies
impact its financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical
are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of
judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Our management believes that given current facts and circumstances,
it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause effect on our results of operations,
financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

Changes
to accounting principles are established by the FASB in the form of ASU s to the FASB s Codification. We consider the applicability
and impact of all ASU s on our financial position, results of operations, stockholders deficit, cash flows, or presentation
thereof.

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 - Financial Instruments-Credit Losses-Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. Codification
Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses, have been released in November 2018 (2018-19), November 2019
(2019-10 and 2019-11) and a January 2020 Update (2020-02) that provided additional guidance on this Topic. This guidance replaces the
current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a
broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. For SEC filers meeting certain criteria, the
amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019.
For SEC filers that meet the criteria of a smaller reporting company (including this Company) and for non-SEC registrant public companies
and other organizations, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
after December 15, 2022. Early adoption will be permitted for all organizations for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently in the process of its analysis of the impact of this guidance on its
financial statements and does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. 

In
December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This guidance, among other provisions,
eliminates certain exceptions to existing guidance related to the approach for intra period tax allocation, the methodology for calculating
income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. This guidance also requires
an entity to reflect the effect of an enacted change in tax laws or rates in its effective income tax rate in the first interim period
that includes the enactment date of the new legislation, aligning the timing of recognition of the effects from enacted tax law changes
on the effective income tax rate with the effects on deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Under existing guidance, an entity recognizes
the effects of the enacted tax law change on the effective income tax rate in the period that includes the effective date of the tax
law. ASU 2019-12 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. We adopted
this pronouncement on January 1, 2021; however, the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on the Company s
financial statements. 

In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives
and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in
an Entity s Own Equity , to reduce complexity in applying U.S. GAAP to certain financial instruments with characteristics
of liabilities and equity. ASU 2020-06 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption
permitted. We adopted this pronouncement on January 1, 2021; however, the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on
the Company s financial statements.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022
and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the
years in the two-years ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial
statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the two years in the period
ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered net losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency,
which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans regarding those matters are
discussed in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB
.. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and the significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that
were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material
to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication
of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we
are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts
or disclosures to which it relates. 

Going
Concern 

Due
to the net loss, negative cash flows from operations for the year, and working capital deficiency, the Company evaluated the need for
a going concern listed in note 2. 

Auditing
management s evaluation of a going concern can be a significant judgment given the fact that the Company uses management estimates
on future revenues and expenses, which are not able to be easily substantiated. 

We
evaluated the appropriateness of the going concern, we examined and evaluated the financial information along with management s
plans to mitigate the going concern and management s disclosure on going concern.

The

necessary due to the Company s continued operating losses and the uncertainty of the Company s ability to utilize all of

In
December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This guidance, among other provisions,
eliminates certain exceptions to existing guidance related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating
income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. This guidance also requires
an entity to reflect the effect of an enacted change in tax laws or rates in its effective income tax rate in the first interim period
that includes the enactment date of the new legislation, aligning the timing of recognition of the effects from enacted tax law changes
on the effective income tax rate with the effects on deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Under existing guidance, an entity recognizes
the effects of the enacted tax law change on the effective income tax rate in the period that includes the effective date of the tax
law. ASU 2019-12 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. We adopted
this pronouncement on January 1, 2021; however, the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company s financial
statements. However, based on the Company s history of immaterial credit losses from trade receivables, management does not expect
that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. 

In
August 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity; Own Equity ASU 2020-06 ),
as part of its overall simplification initiative to reduce costs and complexity of applying accounting standards while maintaining or
improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Among other changes, the new guidance removes
from GAAP separation models for convertible debt that require the convertible debt to be separated into a debt and equity component,
unless the conversion feature is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative or the debt is issued at a substantial premium.
As a result, after adopting the guidance, entities will no longer separately present such embedded conversion features in equity and
will instead account for the convertible debt wholly as debt. The new guidance also requires use of the if-converted method
when calculating the dilutive impact of convertible debt on earnings per share, which is consistent with the Company s current
accounting treatment under the current guidance. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted, but only at the beginning of the
fiscal year. The Company adopted the guidance under ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2022. The adoption of this guidance and had no material
impact on the Company s financial statements.

The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC Topic 820-10 are described below: 

Level
 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that an entity has the ability to access.
 We believe our carrying value of level 1 instruments approximate their fair value at December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Level
 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets
 that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term
 of the assets or liabilities. 

Level
 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the
 assets or liabilities. We consider depleting assets, asset retirement obligations and net profit interest liability to be Level 3.
 We determine the fair value of Level 3 assets and liabilities utilizing various inputs, including NYMEX price quotations and contract
 terms.

capital and implement its business plan. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the
Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

Management
believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic plans provide the opportunity for
the Company to continue as a going concern.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Pursuant
to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act ), the Company carried out an evaluation, with
the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief
Financial Officer CFO (the Company s principal financial and accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022. Based upon that
evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as
of December 31, 2022, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits
under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s CEO
and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 

Our
Chief Executive Officer, as the principal executive officer (chief executive officer) and principal financial officer (chief financial
officer), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, our internal controls and procedures may not prevent or detect misstatements. A control system, no matter
how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
and procedures may deteriorate. 

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The framework
used by management in making that assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled Internal Control Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment, our
management has determined that as of December 31, 2022, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective
for the purposes for which it is intended based on the following material weaknesses: 

Lack
 of internal audit function . During 2021, the Company, upon review of the independent auditors, made some adjustments to its financial
 statements, including, adjusting salary amounts and the related tax accruals, correcting warrant expense for a warrant issued to
 a related party, and adding the liability due to our attorney that should have been recorded. Management believes that the foregoing
 is due to the fact that the Company lacks qualified resources to perform the internal audit functions properly and that the scope
 and effectiveness of the internal audit function are yet to be developed. Specifically, the reporting mechanism between the accounting
 department and the Board of Directors and the CEO was not effective, therefore resulting in the delay of recording and reporting. 

No
 Segregation of Duties Ineffective controls over financial reporting : As of December 31, 2022, we had no full-time employees with
 the requisite expertise in the key functional areas of finance and accounting. As a result, there is a lack of proper segregation
 of duties necessary to insure that all transactions are accounted for accurately and in a timely manner. 

33 

Lack
 of a functioning audit committee : Due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors
 on our board of directors, and no audit committee has been elected, the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required
 internal controls and procedures is inadequate. 

Written
 Policies Procedures : Due to lack of written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting, the Company
 did not establish a formal process to close our books monthly and account for all transactions. 

Lack
 of controls over related party transactions: As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not establish a formal written policy for
 the approval, identification and authorization of related party transactions. 

We
are developing a plan to ensure that all information will be recorded, processed, summarized and reported accurately, and as of the date
of this report, we have hired a payroll service firm to manage all payroll functions including tax withholdings. We will take the following
steps to address the above-referenced material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting: 

1. 
 We
 will continue to educate our management personnel to increase its ability to comply with the disclosure requirements and financial
 reporting controls; and 

2. 
 We
 will increase management oversight of accounting and reporting functions in the future; and 

3. 
 As
 soon as we can raise sufficient capital or our operations generate sufficient cash flow, we will hire personnel to handle our accounting
 and reporting functions. 

While
the first two steps of our remediation process are ongoing, we do not expect to remediate the weaknesses in our internal controls over
financial reporting until the time when we start to commercialize a recombinant fiber (and, therefore, may have sufficient cash flow
for hiring personnel to handle our accounting and reporting functions). 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant
to the rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this report. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

No
change in our system of internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December
31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

emphasizes commercial and civil rights litigation. In his civil rights practice, Mr. Thompson was, and remains a staunch defender of
constitutional rights with a focus on freedom of speech, Fourth Amendment protections, and combating racial discrimination. Prior to

Juris Doctorate from the University of Michigan. Mr. Thompson is a member of the Triple Nine Society for persons with documented genius

is the inventor of the technology concept that led to the formation of the Company. For his efforts in disrupting the textile markets,
Mr. Thompson was recognized as one of the top 20 Pioneering CEO s of 2019. We believe that Mr. Thompson is well suited to serve

KENNETH
LE 

Mr.
Le was appointed as our Director of government relations and the President of Prodigy Textiles in July 2019. In light of his position
with our subsidiary and the duties associated with such position, we believe Mr. Le meets the definition of executive officer 
as such term is defined in the Exchange Act. Kenneth Le has over 25 years of successful international business experience specializing
in entrepreneurial enterprises. As previous managing partner of Pacific Bay Ventures, Mr. Le worked on a joint venture developing 1,550

Asia, many of which he has helped bring together acting as international liaison. Management believes that Mr. Le s work has been
instrumental in helping the Company establish and grow its operations in Southeast Asia.

Committees 

Our
board of directors has not established any committees, including an audit committee, a compensation committee, a nominating committee
or any committee performing a similar function. The functions of those committees are being undertaken by our sole Board member. Because
we have only one director and do not have any independent directors, the establishment of committees of the Board of Directors would
not provide any benefits to our company and could be considered more form than substance. In addition, we do not have an audit
committee financial expert, because our sole director does not qualify as such within the applicable definition of the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

auditing or permitted non-audit related service, the engagement be: 

approved
 by our audit committee; or 

entered
 into pursuant to pre-approval policies and procedures established by the audit committee, provided the policies and procedures are
 detailed as to the particular service, the audit committee is informed of each service, and such policies and procedures do not include
 delegation of the audit committee s responsibilities to management. 

We
do not have an audit committee. Our entire board of directors pre-approves all services provided by our independent auditors. 

The
pre-approval process has just been implemented in response to the new rules. Therefore, our board of directors does not have records
of what percentages of the above fees were pre-approved. However, all of the above services and fees were reviewed and approved by the
entire board of directors either before or after the respective services were rendered.

Exhibit 4.2 

 Description of Securities 

General 

Our original articles of incorporation authorized
60,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, 25,000,000 shares of Class B common stock with no par value per share and 10,000,000 shares
of preferred stock with no par value per share. On March 18, 2009, we amended our articles of incorporation to provide for unlimited authorized
shares, no par value, of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, and preferred stock. In December 2013, we further amended our
articles of incorporation to designate Series A of the Company s preferred stock, no par value; there are two shares of Series A
preferred stock authorized. There are no provisions in our charter or by-laws that would delay, defer or prevent a change in our control.
As of the date hereof, we have 1,033,374,219 shares of Class A common stock, 0 shares of Class B common stock and 2 shares of Series
A Preferred Stock outstanding. The Class B common stock is not listed on the OTCQB or any other market and we are not seeking to have
it listed on Nasdaq or another national exchange. 

Common Stock 

As of the date hereof, 1,033,374,219 shares of Class
A common stock were issued and outstanding and held by 33 stockholders of record, and we had no shares of Class B common stock issued
and outstanding. Holders of our Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share on all matters submitted to a stockholder vote; Class
B common stock does not have any voting rights. 

Holders of Common Stock do not have cumulative voting
rights. 

Holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock
voting for the election of directors can elect all of the directors. Holders of our common stock representing a majority of the voting
power of our capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, are necessary to constitute
a quorum at any meeting of our stockholders. A vote by the holders of a majority of our outstanding shares is required to effectuate certain
fundamental corporate changes such as liquidation, merger or an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation. 

Although there are no provisions in our charter or
by-laws that may delay, defer or prevent a change in control, we are authorized, without stockholder approval, to issue shares of preferred
stock that may contain rights or restrictions that could have this effect. 

Holders of both classes of common stock are entitled
to share in all dividends that the Board, in its discretion, declares from legally available funds. In the event of liquidation, dissolution
or winding up, each outstanding share entitles its holder to participate pro rata in all assets that remain after payment of liabilities
and after providing for each class of stock, if any, having preference over the common stock. Holders of both classes of our common stock
have no pre-emptive rights, no conversion rights and there are no redemption provisions applicable to our common stock. 

Preferred Stock 

Our Board has the authority, without further action
by the stockholders, to issue from time to time the preferred stock in one or more series for such consideration and with such relative
rights, privileges, preferences and restrictions that the Board may determine. The preferences, powers, rights and restrictions of different
series of preferred stock may differ with respect to dividend rates, amounts payable on liquidation, voting rights, conversion rights,
redemption provisions, sinking fund provisions and purchase funds and other matters. The issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect
the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock. 

Effective December 17, 2013, the Company amended its
Articles of Incorporation to designate Series A of the Company s preferred stock, no par value. Under the amendment, there are two
shares of Series A preferred stock authorized. The holders of Series A preferred stock are entitled to vote together with the holders
of the Company s common stock on all matters upon which the Company s stockholders may vote. 

Each share of Series A preferred stock is entitled
to 200,000,000 votes on all such matters. Each share of Series A preferred stock is convertible into one share of the Company s
common stock at the holder s option. On December 19, 2013, the Company issued two shares of Series A preferred stock to Kim Thompson,
the Company s founder, CEO, CFO, President, and sole director. 

The shares of Series A preferred stock were issued
to Mr. Thompson in exchange for an agreement to extend to October, 30, 2014 the date on which the Company would pay certain debts owed
to Mr. Thompson. As part of the transaction, Mr. Thompson also agreed to forgive 30,000 which the Company owed to him as compensation.
In connection with the transaction, the Company incurred a loss on settlement of debt of 5,187,800. 

Dividends 

Since inception we have not paid any cash dividends
on our capital stock. We currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock. Although
we intend to retain our earnings, if any, to finance the exploration and growth of our business, our Board will have the discretion to
declare and pay dividends in the future. Payment of dividends in the future will depend upon our earnings, capital requirements, and other
factors, which our Board may deem relevant. 

Certain Anti-Takeover Effects 

Certain provisions of Wyoming law may have an anti-takeover
effect and may delay or prevent a tender offer or other acquisition transaction that a shareholder might consider to be in his or her
best interest. The summary of the provisions of Wyoming law set forth below does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety
by reference to Wyoming law. 

The issuance of shares of preferred stock, the issuance
of rights to purchase such shares, and the imposition of certain other adverse effects on any party contemplating a takeover could be
used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal. For instance, the issuance of the preferred stock, if the option to acquire such
shares is exercised, would impede a business combination by the voting rights that would enable a holder to block such a transaction.
In addition, under certain circumstances, the issuance of other preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of holders of
our common stock. 

Under Wyoming law, a director, in determining what
he reasonably believes to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, does not need to consider only the interests
of the corporation s stockholders in any takeover matter but may also, in his discretion, may consider any of the following: 

(i) 
 The interests of the corporation s employees, suppliers, creditors and customers; 

(ii) 
 The economy of the state and nation; 

(iii) 
 The impact of any action upon the communities in or near which the corporation s facilities or operations are located; 

(iv) 
 The long-term interests of the corporation and its stockholders, including the possibility that those interests may be best served by the continued independence of the corporation; and 

(v) 
 Any other factors relevant to promoting or preserving public or community interests. 

The outstanding Series A Preferred Stock can deter
a takeover. 

Because our Board is not required to make any determination
on matters affecting potential takeovers solely based on its judgment as to the best interests of our stockholders, our board of directors
could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some, or a majority, of our stockholders
might believe to be in their best interests or in which such stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then market
price of such stock. Our Board of directors presently does not intend to seek stockholder approval prior to the issuance of currently
authorized stock, unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange rules. 

Transfer Agent 

The transfer agent for our Common Stock is Olde Monmouth
Stock Transfer Co., Inc. 

Listing 

Our Common stock is quoted on the OTCQB under the
trading symbol KBLB . We have applied to have our Common Stock listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol KBLB 
and our Purchase Warrants listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol KBLBW . 

Limitation on Liability and Indemnification Matters 

Our amended and restated articles of incorporation
and amended and restated bylaws include provisions limiting the liability of directors and officers and indemnifying them under certain
circumstances. Accordingly, we may indemnify any person (including his estate) made or threatened to be made a party to any suit or proceeding,
whether civil or criminal, by reason of the fact that he was one of our directors or officers or served at our request as one of our directors
or officers of a subsidiary, against judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement and reasonable expenses, including attorney fees actually
and necessarily incurred as a result of such threat, suit or proceeding, or any appeal therein, to the fullest extent permitted by the
General Corporation Law of the State of Wyoming. 

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising
under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling the Company pursuant to Wyoming law, we
are informed that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed
in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. 

Penny Stock Regulation 

The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define
 penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than Five Dollars 5.00) per share or an exercise
price of less than Five Dollars 5.00) per share. Such securities are subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements
on broker-dealers who sell them. For transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination
for the purchaser of such securities and have received the purchaser s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase.
Additionally, for any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of
a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable
to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole
market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer s presumed control over the market. Finally, among
other requirements, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information
on the limited market in penny stocks.
