We provide satellite imagery as visual evidence of ground truth to promote global transparency and expose injustice. Access to our high-resolution satellite imagery has enabled journalists to accurately report on areas that are too remote or dangerous to visit or are otherwise inaccessible. Our Earth Observation Constellation As of December 31, 2022, we operated a constellation of four in-orbit and fully commissioned Earth observation satellites: GeoEye-1, WorldView-1, WorldView-2 and WorldView-3. Our annual collection capacity is approximately 1.4 billion square kilometers. We have collected, and have available for use, approximately 150 petabytes in our Image Library. We re-evaluate the depreciable lives of our satellites annually based on established methodologies used for accounting purposes. The lives we assign for depreciation purposes are typically shorter than the lives we use for planning purposes and our history shows that in most cases the estimated useful lives of our satellites have increased from the initial lives determined upon launch. The following table summarizes the primary characteristics of the in-orbit and fully-commissioned Earth observation satellites in our constellation as of December 31, 2022: 

Satellite Launch Date Expected End of Depreciable Life Best Ground Resolution Orbital Altitude (kilometers) WorldView-3 August 2014 Q1 2026 31-centimeters black and white, or color 1.24-meter multi-spectral 618 WorldView-2 October 2009 Q4 2024 46-centimeters black and white, or color 1.84-meter multi-spectral 770 WorldView-1 September 2007 Q3 2024 50-centimeters panchromatic 496 GeoEye-1 September 2008 Q3 2024 41-centimeters black and white, or color 1.64-meter multi-spectral 681 WorldView Legion will be a fleet of six high performing satellites for which our Space Infrastructure segment is acting as prime contractor. We expect that WorldView Legion, in addition to our current constellation, will revisit rapidly changing areas up to 15 times per day, an increase from four times per day currently, which will more than triple both our capacity to collect 30 cm-class imagery and our overall capacity in high demand areas. Our Earth observation satellites have advanced technical capabilities, such as maneuverability, size of collection area, collection speed, revisit time, resolution, accuracy and spectral diversity. Additionally, our satellites are designed, manufactured and operated in the U.S. for assurance of U.S. national security missions and data protection.

These policies cover the launches plus the first year in orbit. Following the first year in orbit, we will seek to obtain in-orbit coverage similar to the coverage we currently have on our in-orbit and fully-commissioned satellite constellation noted in the table above. Competitive Conditions and Trends in Industry Demands Our Earth Intelligence business operates in a highly competitive and rapidly growing industry. Our major existing and potential competitors for our Earth Intelligence business include commercial satellite imagery companies, state-owned imagery providers, aerial imagery companies, free sources of imagery, unmanned aerial vehicles and companies that provide geospatial analytic information and services to the U.S. government, including defense prime contractors. We face competition from companies that provide geospatial analytic information and services to the U.S. government, including defense prime contractors such as L3Harris and Booz Allen Hamilton. We compete on the basis of several factors, including: the technical capabilities of our satellites, such as size of collection area, collection speed, revisit time, resolution, accuracy and spectral diversity; satellite availability for tasked orders; the size, comprehensiveness and relevance of our Image Library; on-demand platforms and tools that enable customers to easily access and integrate imagery; value-added services, including harnessing advancements in ML by applying computer vision and pattern analysis technology to geospatial problems; and derivative products such as 3D models and map vector data. The Earth observation market includes the collection and processing of optical and non-optical imagery data of the Earth. Specifically, the market is segmented into Data, Value-Added Services VAS ), Information Products and Big Data Analytics. The Data segment consists of raw imagery transmitted from the satellite to the ground station and products, such as stereo imaging and basic corrections (radiometric and geometric). VAS includes processing through layering or data fusion (such as with traffic information and street names). Big Data Analytics includes statistical analysis, change detection and predictive modeling using large quantities of imagery and meta data overlays to provide insights over a given period of time. Our Earth Intelligence business provides Earth observation services to customers in a variety of sectors, including defense and intelligence, energy and natural resources, industrials, social media, mapping, managed living resources (such as agriculture and forestry), public authorities, services (such as finance, insurance, news and media) and weather. Providers of imagery and data in this market generally compete on resolution, accuracy, revisit frequency, delivery (cloud versus traditional) and pricing. Euroconsult reports that the commercial market for Earth observation data was 1.7 billion in 2021 and is forecasted to top 2.7 billion by 2031, a compound annual growth rate of 5 . According to Euroconsult, defense represents approximately 69 of the Earth observation data market, and sales to non-U.S. defense markets are forecasted to be the most significant driver of revenue growth, driven by higher revisit constellations with higher resolutions. Euroconsult reports the commercial market for Earth observation VAS was 2.8 billion in 2021 and is forecasted to top 5.2 billion by 2031, a compound annual growth rate of 6 .

We sell our products and technologies in a highly competitive industry and we compete on the basis of cost, reliability, design life, technological capabilities and efficiencies. Our primary competitors for satellite manufacturing contracts are: The Boeing Company, Lockheed Martin Corporation and Northrop Grumman Corporation in the United States; Thales S.A. and Airbus Defence and Space, a subsidiary of the Airbus Group, in Europe; and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation in Japan. Additionally, we face competition from newer entrants. In addition, many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we do. We may also face competition in the future from emerging low-cost competitors in India, Russia and China. GEO satellites track with the rotation of the Earth and remain over a fixed point over the Earth s surface. GEO satellites cover more area from a higher vantage point and tend to carry more advanced sensor or communication suites, as used in broad area communications and global-scale weather payloads. Due to this unique property of their orbit, GEO slots are limited, which motivates operators to maximize the use of their slot, leading to generally larger satellites to support the required power and bandwidth, as well as a longer design life to maximize return on investment. Due to their greater distance from Earth, however, there is increased latency. The satellite industry has undergone a significant change with the proliferation of LEO satellites, which have been primarily used for both Earth observation and communications payloads. Typically, LEO constellation satellites are cheaper to launch as they are significantly smaller and require less fuel to reach orbit. Additionally, due to the lower orbital altitude, LEO observation satellites enable higher resolution imagery. This factor also enables LEO communication satellites to reduce latency but require a much larger constellation to ensure coverage over a given area as, unlike GEO satellites, LEO satellites move in and out of view of ground locations as they complete their orbit. In addition to altitude class, satellites are classified by functions, such as communications or Earth observation. Euroconsult projects satellite demand will experience a five-fold increase over the next ten years. While LEO is expected to account for the majority of the demand, Euroconsult expects an average of 13 GEO commercial satellite orders per year over the next ten years, representing one-third of the total market value. According to Euroconsult , the

 total market for manufacturing and launch services is expected to reach 400 billion over the next decade, a 46 increase from the previous decade of 273 billion in revenue. LEO proliferation is expected to greatly increase access to space, thus enabling new commercial customers across diversified industries including oil and gas, insurance, agriculture and asset management firms, as well as nonprofit organizations, to benefit from satellite imagery. Discontinued Operations On April 8, 2020, we completed the sale of our former Canadian subsidiary MDA Business to Neptune Acquisition Inc., a corporation existing under the laws of the Province of British Columbia and an affiliate of Northern Private Capital Ltd. See Note 3, Discontinued Operations , to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding our sale of the MDA Business. Industry Overview Large and Growing Addressable Market We believe that there is potential for growth among three key components of our addressable market: the U.S. government, other governments and commercial customers. For both the U.S. and other governments, drivers of growth include persistent global security threats, defense budgets, demand for high-quality imagery and value-added services and a focus on space as an investment. We believe that the U.S. government is interested in expanding the use of commercial alternatives to owned assets and that other governments present an opportunity for growth. We seek to align our products and services with the U.S. Department of Defense DOD s National Defense Strategy needs, as well as growing international defense and intelligence demand. For civil customers, in particular NASA, growth is being driven by space exploration programs such as Artemis and Earth science projects. For commercial customers, drivers of growth include strong demand for 3D imagery and more frequent imagery refreshes, as well as insights driven by AI and ML, space-based remote sensing, GEO replacement demand and LEO communications programs. Diverse Solutions for Diverse End Market Users While traditionally spending in space has been dominated by military defense programs and the communications industry, the proliferation of technology and cheaper access to space has led to a diversification in end market users. AI, ML and cloud computing have given rise to multiple use cases across industries, such as mobility and logistics, insurance, finance, environmental, social and governance ESG matters, non-governmental organizations and emerging technologies in simulation, gaming, AR/VR and the metaverse. Concurrently, geopolitical competition in space as a contested domain is leading to further investment by global militaries. We have evolved with this changing environment to serve a multitude of customers. Government Investment in Space Programs With more than half of our revenues coming from U.S. government customers, we expect that our Space Infrastructure and Earth Intelligence segments will benefit from growing defense and space infrastructure budgets. We expect the proliferation of space-based ISR and communications to drive increased government investments in the sector through the mid-2020s. Global Euroconsult reports that government space budgets reached 103 billion in 2022, a 9 increase over 2021 figures. Additionally, Euroconsult reports the gap between civil and defense space budgets continues to decrease, with civil budgets totaling 55 billion and defense space programs totaling 48 billion in 2022. Looking forward, Euroconsult expects that the rapid growth of defense budgets will continue in the short-term but will eventually lessen later in the decade as current growth trajectories do not appear sustainable in the long-term.

 United States In the U.S., there is a concerted effort by the government to accelerate space investment. Congress appropriated 26.3 billion for the fiscal year FY 2023 for the National Security Space NSS programs, representing growth of 45 from FY 2022 of 18.1 billion. The request is now inclusive of the budgets for Space Force and the Space Development Agency. The NSS budget generally excludes funding for the NRO and NGA. Specific funding levels for these organizations, which are long-term historical customers of our Earth Intelligence segment, are generally classified. However, the NRO and NGA are included in the funding for the National Intelligence Program NIP ). The requested funding for the NIP for FY 2023 was 67.1 billion, a 2 increase from the FY 2022 enacted budget of 65.7 billion. Additionally, the requested funding for the Military Intelligence Program MIP was 26.6 billion for FY 2023, a 10 increase from the FY 2022 enacted budget of 24.1 billion. Furthermore, NASA received 25.4 billion in FY 2023, an increase of 5 from FY 2022. The NASA budget further highlights an effort by the government to invest in space exploration and development, with 8.7 billion of the total allocated for deep space exploration systems and space technology. These include the key components of On-Orbit Servicing, Assembly and Manufacturing OSAM-1 and the Artemis program that will send astronauts to the Moon and beyond, including the lunar Gateway. Growth Strategy Our vision is to hold leading positions in each of the sectors we serve. We aim to achieve this by applying innovative technologies and capabilities that provide value to our customers across their entire value chain, including components, subsystems, systems, data and services. Specific elements of our strategy across our two segments include: Earth Intelligence Driving revenue growth through improvements in our products We seek to improve and develop new Earth Intelligence products with WorldView Legion by productizing technologies and derivative content developed in support of individual customer contracts, such as using more AI/ML to extract features, detect objects and detect change in our satellite imagery and complementary content. We believe we provide imagery with better than three times the accuracy of the nearest small-sat competitor and we believe that our accuracy advantage is even greater in areas where we have leveraged our 3D and elevation capabilities. We believe we will be able to provide even greater quality imagery and with higher revisit rates upon deployment of our WorldView Legion satellites. The revisit rate and increase in capacity enables a clearer understanding of on-ground conditions, allowing for more real-time, actionable analysis to deliver insights on rapidly changing environments and populations, while providing for more frequent monitoring for defense and intelligence applications, enhanced emergency responsiveness and maritime surveillance, among other applications. We have developed technology used to enhance the quality and usability of imagery (e.g. eliminate atmospheric distortions, increase positional accuracy, improved interpretability, etc.), create information derivatives (e.g. road vectors, material types, land classification, etc.), fuse multiple types of content (e.g. Internet of Things, optical imagery, synthetic aperture radar imagery, radio frequency information, vectors, social media, etc.), to detect change, understand patterns of life and gain early warning of trending events. We believe this type of high-resolution, highly accurate collection capacity will power wide-area, AI/ML modeling, sensor-to-decision applications and a reference globe for AR/VR metaverse applications. Additionally, we believe our resolution and accuracy are key enablers for deriving highly accurate and life-like 3D models, which will allow customers to transition from 2D to 3D capabilities that address critical missions such as GPS-denied navigation, digital twin simulations, synthetic and real-world training environments, autonomous vehicle routing and telecommunications network planning. We believe that creating standard products using this technology will grow our product-based revenue with customers in the technology, defense and intelligence, civil government and global development organization sectors. Expanding our relationship with the U.S. government The U.S. government is the largest customer of our Earth Intelligence segment through the EOCL Contract, G-EGD and OWT programs and various classified and unclassified contract vehicles. Demand for geospatial intelligence and services continues to grow given the geopolitical environment

 and the confluence of high-performance computing and ML algorithms that allow for insights to be extracted from ever greater levels of data being produced by Earth observation sensors and national and commercial satellite assets. The U.S. government has expressed interest in increasingly relying on commercial partners to harness the rapid pace of commercial innovation more effectively, including the continued use of geospatial data given cost affordability and advances in technology that provide high-quality imagery. We seek to grow our business with the U.S. government by leveraging the investments we have made across our capability set, including in AI and ML and our strong record of historic performance. Growing our installed base and penetration of international defense and intelligence customers We currently provide service to U.S.-allied nations through our DAP, RAP, SecureWatch and Precision-3D products. These customers use our imagery in their civil and intelligence related missions. Our imagery and services are either complementary to national assets owned by these countries, or in some cases defer the need for a country to invest in owned and operated national assets. We believe there are many prospective customers that have both the mission need and budget for our services which we seek to add to our installed base. We also seek to further penetrate existing customers through the provision of additional data and services. Lastly, we believe there are opportunities to provide our services to U.S. allied nations who might seek a complement to national capabilities in geospatial analytics. Our strategy focuses on those countries that currently have deep and longstanding relationships with our Earth Intelligence segment and other close U.S. allies. Growing with and expanding our installed base among enterprise customers We have over 500 enterprise customers that use our data in their products and applications across a variety of industries including technology, telecommunications, transportation, mining, mapping, social media and oil and gas. The confluence of high-performance computing and ML algorithms are allowing for insights to be extracted from ever greater quantities of imagery and meta data, which in turn is driving innovation across our customer base. We expect this trend to continue, and we seek to grow with our existing customers as well as to grow our installed base in new industry verticals by leveraging our sector leading imagery capabilities. Furthermore, we believe our capabilities in AI and ML, 3D and Big Data Analytics products will position us to sell additional solutions and services to our commercial customers. Providing products that leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning AI and ML enable us to extract greater insight from our geospatial data to deliver actionable intelligence to our customers. We have continued to refine and improve our approach to AI and ML, which benefit from our large volumes of historical training data and high-quality imagery. Our recent acquisition of Wovenware Inc. exemplifies this approach. Productization of our AI/ML capability will enable delivery of higher value, enriched geospatial data that we expect will facilitate deeper penetration of the U.S. government, international governments and commercial markets. Delivering 3D products to global defense, intelligence and commercial customers We are expanding the demand for global-scale 3D products. 3D products allow decision-makers to understand their operational environment in 3D developing new insights that enable them to make better, faster decisions. We see a growing opportunity to sell 3D data and software products to the military and intelligence community to support virtual training environments and provide better information to the warfighter. U.S. and allied defense and intelligence customers are seeking solutions to support intelligence fusion, maneuver and other mission requirements. We also see significant opportunity with our commercial customers as they look for more accurate 3D geodata to deliver their products through new mediums like AR and VR. Additionally, we have entered into license arrangements related to certain consumer applications. The current investment in 5G networks and Internet of Things provides a unique opportunity to deliver network operators a better data solution to improve their future networks. Additional use cases continue to grow as 3D products and precision data-sets become better understood. Space Infrastructure Driving revenue through improvement in our products and manufacturing and program capabilities We are developing differentiated capabilities that are designed for future space exploration, including propulsion, power and robotics. We believe these elements will be critical to helping our customers operate in an increasingly contested space environment and in achieving successful space exploration missions. We are also developing our satellite architectures and manufacturing capabilities as we strive to assure that we can successfully fulfill both government and commercial 
 12 

Table of Contents 
 customer requirements on future programs, including high volume / low mix and variable volume / high mix programs. We plan to team with providers of digital payload technology to enhance our offering if our customers express interest in it. We are also developing relationships across the supply chain to assure that we can seamlessly provide a broad breadth of mission sets to our customers. Finally, we are working to transform our operations (e.g., location strategy, workforce shaping, technology and systems investment and Cost Accounting Standard / Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR compliance) so that we can address a larger set of opportunities across our government and commercial customers. Growing our U.S. and international civil exposure We have a long history with civil space programs dating back to the Apollo missions. Current NASA programs include the Power and Propulsion Element for the Lunar Gateway, OSAM-1, Psyche and TEMPO. We have also built robotic arms on six of NASA s Mars rovers and landers. We seek to leverage our investments and expertise in propulsion, power and robotics, as well as our strong legacy of performance, when pursuing further civil work in the U.S. and abroad. Deepening our penetration of U.S. national programs To date, we have won several classified and unclassified study contracts with U.S. defense and intelligence customers. We seek to further penetrate these markets by utilizing our flexible satellite architectures, design and engineering capabilities and commercial business practices all of which we believe can create compelling value propositions. Providing flexible platforms to our commercial customers We currently provide components, subsystems and system architectures to our customers for communications and Earth observation satellites in LEO, MEO and GEO. In communications, we offer flexible platforms across various architecture platforms and mission payloads from standard analog to high throughput, and we are investing in digital systems. In Earth observation, we also offer flexible solutions across various architecture platforms and mission payloads, including electro-optical. Our goal is to be positioned well to compete for future single satellite or full constellation build orders from our customers, across a wide range of the architectures, payloads or Earth orbit chosen to fulfill mission requirements. Government Contracts and Compliance with Government Regulations Our operations are heavily regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws. Our operations in the U.S. government market are subject to significant government regulation. We contract with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including branches of the U.S. military and NASA. We must comply with, and are affected by, laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government and other governments contracts, including foreign governments. Compliance with legislation or regulations promulgated by these authorities could result in material adverse effects on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position. In addition, noncompliance with legislation or regulations promulgated by these authorities could result in limitations on, or the suspension or revocation of, our licenses or registrations, the termination or loss of contracts or the imposition of contractual damages, civil fines or criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, any government policy changes, which may be substantial, could increase regulatory uncertainty. The adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business. In addition, the manner in which regulations or legislation in these areas may be interpreted and enforced cannot be precisely determined, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional information about the government regulations affecting our business and the risks relating to government contracts and regulations appears in Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. U.S. Government Contracts All of our reportable segments have contracts with various governmental entities, which are concentrated in a small number of primary contracts. The U.S. government may terminate or suspend our contracts, including the EOCL Contract with the U.S. government in our Earth Intelligence segment, at any time with or without cause. In May 2022, the NRO awarded us a 10-year contract, inclusive of a 5-year base contract as part of the EOCL Contract. The EOCL Contract transitioned the imagery acquisition requirements previously addressed by the EnhancedView Contract and replaces the scope of the EnhancedView Contract with respect to such requirements. While the imagery acquisition portion of the EnhancedView Contract has moved to EOCL, we will continue to perform other awarded services on the 
 13 

Table of Contents 
 EnhancedView Contract through 2025, concurrent with the new EOCL Contract. The opportunity to increase services beyond the awarded amount is also built into the EOCL Contract. Any changes in the size, scope or term of the EOCL Contract could impact our satellite replenishment strategy and our ability to repay or refinance our long-term debt. Although our U.S. government contracts generally involve fixed annual minimum commitments, such commitments, along with all other contracts with the U.S. government, are subject to annual Congressional appropriations and the federal budget process and as a result, the U.S. government may not continue to fund these contracts at current or anticipated levels. The loss or reduction in scope of any one of our primary U.S. government contracts would materially reduce our revenue and adversely impact our operating results and competitive position. Foreign Operations Our international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific in-country purchases, investments, manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations, known as offset obligations, and provide for penalties in the event we fail to meet such requirements. Environmental Regulations Our operations are regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment, including laws governing the discharge of pollutants into the soil, air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We have infrastructure in place to ensure that our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. We do not believe that the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, operating results or competitive position. The imposition of more stringent standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations or a determination that we are responsible for the release of hazardous substances at our sites could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters. We have been designated, along with numerous other companies, as a potentially responsible party for the clean-up of several hazardous waste sites. Based on available information, we do not believe that any costs incurred in connection with such sites will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, capital expenditures or competitive position. There can be no assurance that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future, or that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites at which no problem is currently known. Resources Intellectual Property We own a substantial intellectual property portfolio that includes many U.S. and foreign patents, as well as many U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights. We actively pursue internal development of intellectual property. In addition to our patent portfolio, we own other intellectual property such as unpatented trade secrets, know-how, data and software. Additionally, we rely on licenses of certain intellectual property to conduct our business operations, including certain proprietary rights to and from third parties. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to our operations, we do not believe that any particular trade secret, patent, trademark, copyright, license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss, expiration or termination would have a material effect on our business. Raw Materials Our businesses are generally engaged in limited manufacturing activities and have minimal near-term exposure to fluctuations in the supply of raw materials. For those businesses that manufacture and sell products and systems, most of the value that we provide is labor oriented, such as design, engineering, assembly and test activities. In manufacturing our products, we use our own production capabilities as well as third-party suppliers and subcontractors. Certain aspects of our manufacturing activities require relatively scarce raw materials or specialty component parts; occasionally, we have experienced difficulty in our ability to procure raw materials, components, sub-assemblies and other supplies

Table of Contents 
 required in our manufacturing processes. As we have several firm fixed price contracts, we bear some risk to supply chain delivery issues and price increases. Research and Development We have a history of investing in development of technological advancements in our field of aerospace. We have both internally and externally funded research and development projects. Our current and future business is dependent on developing new enhancements and technology that go into our existing and future products and services. Our annual research and development expenses from continuing operations were 40 million in 2022, 27 million in 2021 and 15 million in 2020. We intend to continue our focus on research and development and product and service enhancements as a key strategy for innovation and growth. One of our current areas of focus is our development of the WorldView Legion program, a capital project, and other new offerings within our Earth Intelligence segment, including 3D technology. In our Space Infrastructure segment, we are also focused on the further development of components to be used in a variety of our products. Our efforts will continue to be directed into fields that we believe offer the greatest opportunities for long-term growth and profitability. Human Capital We endeavor to cultivate a positive employee experience as we deliver on Maxar and customer missions by attracting, engaging and growing current and future Maxar team members; creating strong partnerships across the business; championing culture and fostering an inclusive and diverse environment; and impacting the broader community. We take great pride in our values: Behind the words are leaders, managers and team members who believe in our values and live by them. As of December 31, 2022, we employed 4,600 team members globally of which 95.3 are U.S. based and 4.7 are international. Within the U.S., no team members are unionized, while in Europe a small number of team members are represented by a trade union. Additionally, Maxar employs a highly technical workforce, with 64.2 of our U.S. employees working in technical roles as defined by technical occupations in engineering and information technology. All of these roles require deep technical specialization and knowledge, as well as managers, directors and executives who oversee technical employees and the development and delivery of technical products. Attracting Talent The success of Maxar s business depends largely on our ability to attract, engage and grow a diverse population of talented technical and skilled team members at all levels. To succeed in highly competitive labor markets and for skill sets that are scarce in the market, we have developed talent acquisition, total rewards and team member engagement strategies, to achieve and maintain a competitive position. Total Rewards Our employee rewards programs are designed to provide an innovative, equitable, competitive, sustainable and scalable package that allows us to compete for and retain top talent in our industry and markets, aligned with Maxar s business and strategic objectives.

 In 2022, to focus on attracting and retaining female and nonbinary technical talent, we became partners with AnitaB.org and attended the Grace Hopper Celebration. Through the partnership, we provided AnitaB.org memberships to our team members focusing on mentorship. Additionally, we invited female and nonbinary technologists to attend the Grace Hopper Celebration which provided networking and professional development opportunities. We also continue to focus on increasing the number of diverse candidates in director-level and above leadership roles. For director-level and above roles, we are striving to ensure that a diverse slate of candidates, including at least one female and one ethnically diverse, disabled or veteran candidate, is presented. We have a goal to ensure a diverse slate for 50 or more of our director-level and above leadership roles. In 2022, 75 of open requisitions met the diverse slate requirement and 50 of the positions were filled by diverse candidates. To foster a culture of inclusion and belonging, we launched a new Global Inclusion Course to all team members to raise awareness of implicit bias and teach the foundations of what it takes to be inclusive within a complex, diverse global working environment. Maxar continues to be committed to making progress on this journey and will stay curious and focused on cultivating an inclusive environment that promotes and values diversity, inclusion and belonging. Maxar, as a values-based company, makes this a priority, not just because it s the right thing to do, but because it makes Maxar stronger. Our 2022 data of our U.S. workforce is below:

 Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by impacts resulting from the conflict in Ukraine or related geopolitical tensions. The future revenue and operating results of the Space Infrastructure segment are dependent on our ability to generate a sustainable order rate for the satellite and space manufacturing operations and develop new technologies to meet the needs of our customers or potential new customers. Our business with various governmental entities is subject to the policies, priorities, regulations, mandates and funding levels of such governmental entities and may be negatively or positively impacted by any change thereto. Our revenue, results of operations and reputation may be negatively impacted if our programs fail to meet contractual requirements or our products contain defects or fail to operate in the expected manner. Any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, and security threats could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data, or theft or tampering of intellectual property, any of which could materially adversely impact our business. Satellites are subject to construction and launch delays, launch failures, damage or destruction during launch, the occurrence of which can materially and adversely affect our operations. If our satellites fail to operate as intended, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Loss of, or damage to, a satellite and the failure to obtain data or alternate sources of data for our products may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Interruption or failure of our infrastructure or national infrastructure could hurt our ability to effectively perform our daily operations and provide and produce our products and services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results. Our business with various governmental entities is concentrated in a small number of primary contracts. The loss or reduction in scope of any one of our primary contracts would materially reduce our revenue. We operate in highly competitive industries and in various jurisdictions across the world, which may cause us to have to reduce our prices or to lose market share. Uncertain global macro-economic and political conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are a party to legal proceedings, investigations and other claims or disputes, which are costly to defend and, if determined adversely to us, could require us to pay fines or damages, undertake remedial measures or prevent us from taking certain actions, any of which could adversely affect our business. We are dependent on our ability to attract, train and retain employees. Our inability to do so, or the loss of key personnel, would cause serious harm to our business. Disruptions in U.S. government operations and funding could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Changes in U.S. government policy regarding use of commercial data or space infrastructure providers, or material delay or cancellation of certain U.S. government programs, may have a material adverse effect on our revenue and our ability to achieve our growth objectives. Our business involves significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by insurance. We often rely on a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key products or services and the inability of these key vendors to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our business. Disruptions in the supply of key raw materials or components and difficulties in the supplier qualification process, as well as increases in prices of raw materials, could adversely impact us.

 Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. We may be required to recognize impairment charges. Our business is capital intensive, and we may not be able to raise adequate capital to finance our business strategies, including funding future satellites, or to refinance or renew our debt financing arrangements, or we may be able to do so only on terms that significantly restrict our ability to operate our business. Our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing or government grants to finance operating working capital requirements and growth initiatives may be limited or difficult to obtain, which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Our indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, our ability to operate our business, our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments. Our current financing arrangements contain certain restrictive covenants that impact our future operating and financial flexibility. Our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance. We could be adversely impacted by actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could impact the value of our securities. The price of our common stock has been volatile and may fluctuate substantially. Our operations in the U.S. government market are subject to significant regulatory risk. Failure to comply with the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual could result in interruption, delay or suspension of our ability to provide our products and services, and could result in loss of current and future business with the U.S. government. Our business is subject to various regulatory risks that could adversely affect our operations. Changes in tax law, in our tax rates or in exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our ability to use our U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. Our operations are subject to governmental law and regulations relating to environmental matters, which may expose us to significant costs and liabilities that could negatively impact our financial condition. Risks Related to Our Proposed Merger There are material uncertainties and risks associated with the proposed Merger, including the timing of the consummation of the Merger, which may adversely affect our business and ongoing operations, financial condition and results of operations, employees, customers, shareholders, other parties and business prospects and a failure to complete the Merger on the terms reflected in the Merger Agreement or at all could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and stock price. The announcement and pendency of the proposed Merger may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. On December 15, 2022, we entered into the Merger Agreement with affiliates of funds advised by Advent, and BCI. Uncertainty about the effect of the proposed Merger on our employees, customers, shareholders and other parties may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation regardless of 
 20 

Table of Contents 
 whether the proposed Merger is completed. These risks to our business include the following, all of which could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the proposed Merger: the impairment of our ability to attract, retain, and motivate our employees, including key personnel; the diversion of significant management time and resources towards the completion of the proposed Merger; difficulties maintaining relationships with customers, suppliers, and other business partners; delays or deferments of certain business decisions by our customers, suppliers, and other business partners; the inability to pursue alternative business opportunities or make appropriate changes to our business because the Merger Agreement requires us to use reasonable best efforts to conduct our business in the ordinary course of business and not engage in certain kinds of transactions prior to the completion of the proposed Merger; litigation relating to the proposed Merger and the costs related thereto; the incurrence of significant costs, expenses, and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed Merger; and the limitation on our ability to utilize our existing deferred tax assets related to the U.S. federal and state net operating loss NOL carryforwards and our U.S. tax credit carryforwards Additionally, in approving the Merger Agreement, our Board of Directors considered a number of factors and potential benefits, including the fact that the Merger consideration to be received by holders of our common stock represented an approximately 129 premium over Maxar s closing stock price of 23.10 on December 15, 2022, the last full trading day prior to the announcement of the proposed Merger. If the Merger is not completed, neither we nor the holders of our common stock will realize this benefit of the Merger. Moreover, we would have incurred substantial transaction-related fees and costs and the loss of management time and resources. Failure to consummate the proposed Merger within the expected timeframe or at all could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the proposed Merger will be consummated. The consummation of the proposed Merger is subject to certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. The obligation of each party to consummate the Merger is also conditioned upon the other party s representations and warranties being true and correct to the extent specified in the Merger Agreement and the other party having performed in all material respects its obligations under the Merger Agreement. There can be no assurance that these and other conditions to closing will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all. The Merger Agreement also includes customary termination provisions for both the Company and Parent, and we may be required to pay Parent a termination fee equal to 124.5 million in certain specified circumstances, including, among other circumstances, if Parent terminates the Merger Agreement pursuant to its Triggering Event Termination Right (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or if the Company terminates the Merger Agreement pursuant to its Superior Proposal Termination Right (as defined in the Merger Agreement). If we are required to make this payment, doing so may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that a remedy will be available to us in the event of a breach of the Merger Agreement by Parent or its affiliates or that we will wholly or partially recover for any damages incurred by us in connection with the proposed Merger. A failed transaction may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us among our customers or in the investment community or business community generally. Further, any disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the proposed Merger, including any adverse changes in our relationships with our customers, partners, suppliers and employees, could continue or accelerate in the event of a failed transaction. In addition, if the proposed Merger is not completed, and there are no other parties willing and able to acquire the Company at a price of 53.00 per share or higher, on terms acceptable to us, the share price of our common stock will likely decline to the extent 
 21 

Table of Contents 
 that the current market price of our common stock reflects an assumption that the proposed Merger will be completed. Also, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed Merger, for which we will have received little or no benefit if the proposed Merger is not completed. Many of these fees and costs will be payable by us even if the proposed Merger is not completed and may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than to complete the proposed Merger. Prior to the completion of the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, we are prohibited from entering into certain transactions and taking certain actions that might otherwise be beneficial to us and our stockholders. After the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the effective time, the Merger Agreement restricts us from taking specified actions without the consent of Parent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and requires that our business be conducted in all material respects in the ordinary course of business. These restrictions may prevent us from making appropriate changes to our businesses or organizational structures or from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger and could have the effect of delaying or preventing other strategic transactions. Adverse effects arising from the pendency of the Merger could be exacerbated by any delays in consummation of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement. The Merger, including uncertainty regarding the Merger, may cause customers, suppliers, distributors or strategic partners to delay or defer decisions, which could negatively affect our business and adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our business. The Merger will happen only if certain conditions are met. Many of the conditions are outside our control, and both we and Parent also have the right to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances. Accordingly, there may be uncertainty regarding the completion of the Merger. This uncertainty may cause customers, suppliers, distributors, strategic partners or others that deal with us to delay or defer entering into contracts with us or making other decisions concerning us or seek to change or cancel existing business relationships, which could negatively affect our business. Any delay or deferral of those decisions or changes in existing agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, regardless of whether the Merger is ultimately completed. The Merger may cause difficulty in attracting, motivating and retaining employees. Our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future role with the Company until strategies with regard to these employees are announced or executed, which may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key management, technical, business development, operational and customer-facing employees and other personnel prior to the Merger. If we are unable to retain and replace personnel, we could face disruptions in our operations, loss of existing customers, loss of key information, expertise or know-how, and unanticipated additional recruitment and training costs. The Merger Agreement limits our ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger and may discourage other companies from trying to acquire us for greater consideration than what Parent has agreed to pay. The Merger Agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for us to sell our business to a company other than Parent. These provisions include a general prohibition on us soliciting any acquisition proposal or offer for a competing transaction following the conclusion of the go-shop period provided for in the Merger Agreement, which concluded at 11:59 p.m. New York City time on February 14, 2023. To date, no party has made an acquisition proposal following the execution of the Merger Agreement. If we terminate the Merger Agreement in connection with our Board of Directors authorization for us to enter into a definitive agreement to consummate an alternative transaction contemplated by a superior proposal, we will be required to pay a termination fee of 124.5 million. We may also be required to pay the 124.5 million termination fee if we or Parent terminate the Merger Agreement under certain other circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement.

 These provisions might discourage a third party that has an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of the Company from considering or proposing an acquisition, even if the party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the cash value proposed to be received in the Merger, or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances. Stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the Merger from being completed. In connection with the announcement of the Merger, as is common in the context of mergers and acquisitions of publicly-traded companies, we (along with our directors and officers) have been named in lawsuits and may attract additional lawsuits seeking to enjoin us from proceeding with or consummating the Merger, or seeking to have the Merger rescinded after its consummation. Defending against such claims, even those without merit, could result in substantial costs and divert management s time and resources, which may negatively impact our financial condition and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Such claims could prevent or delay the consummation of the Merger, including through an injunction, and result in additional costs to us. The ultimate resolution of any such lawsuit cannot be predicted, and an adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may cause the Merger to be delayed or not to be completed, which could cause us not to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Merger. For a discussion of the lawsuits that are currently pending, see Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Risks Related to Our Business Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by impacts resulting from the conflict in Ukraine or related geopolitical tensions . U.S. and global businesses and markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the escalation of geopolitical tensions and military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The recent military conflict in Ukraine has also led to sanctions and other penalties being levied by the United States, European Union and other countries against Russia. Additional potential sanctions and penalties have also been proposed and/or threatened. Although the length and impact of the ongoing military conflict is highly unpredictable, the conflict in Ukraine has led to and could lead to further regional instability, market disruptions, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, security conditions, currency exchange rates, and the supply chain, which could create or exacerbate risks facing our business. For example, market disruptions caused by Russian military actions and the resulting sanctions have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect the global economy and financial markets, leading to significant volatility and instability in credit and capital markets and a lack of liquidity in capital markets, potentially making it more difficult for us to raise capital. Further, because of our recent prominence in the media and continued support of the U.S. government and other governments and various media outlets throughout the world, we (and/or partners we use) may be susceptible to attacks by advanced, persistent and highly organized adversaries, including nation states and hostile foreign governments such as Russia and its allies. These attacks could come in the form of, among others, anti-satellite devices, electromagnetic or radio interference with our satellites, cyber and other security attacks, and other similar types of attacks, any or all of which are potentially capable of destroying our satellites or ground systems architecture or rendering them permanently impaired or inoperable. In the event of one or more of these attacks on us and/or our partners, there can be no assurance that any insurance proceeds will be available for any partial or total loss of a satellite or a satellite s performance or any resulting business interruption, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. See also Our business involves significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by insurance below.

 Additionally, although we believe there are alternative sources available to us for products, materials, components and services, if these conditions continue for a prolonged period, we may also experience supply chain disruptions, logistics restrictions, shortages in the availability of key materials and components and our reputation and relationships with our customers may become impaired if we are unable to meet a customer s expectations or contractual requirements. The occurrence of any of the foregoing, especially over a prolonged period, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are actively monitoring the situation in Ukraine and globally and assessing its potential impact on our business. The recent military conflict in Ukraine has positively impacted our revenues and earnings. This may not reoccur in the future in the event of any future resolution of conflict or ease of tensions in Ukraine and it is possible that the conflict may adversely affect our operations in the future. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions are impossible to predict, but could be substantial, and it is impossible to predict the extent to which our operations, or those of our suppliers, vendors and customers, will be impacted in the short and long term, or the ways in which the conflict may impact or disrupt our business. Any such impacts or disruptions may also magnify the impact of other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The future revenue and operating results of the Space Infrastructure segment are dependent on our ability to generate a sustainable order rate for the satellite and space manufacturing operations and develop new technologies to meet the needs of our customers or potential new customers. The Space Infrastructure segment s financial performance is dependent on its ability to generate a sustainable order rate for its satellite and space manufacturing operations. This can be challenging and may fluctuate on an annual basis as the number of satellite construction contracts awarded varies and in 2018 there was a substantial step down in the total number and dollar value of geostationary communication satellite contracts awarded compared to such historical averages prior to 2015. The industry now expects an average of 13 GEO commercial satellite orders per year over the next ten years; however, the actual number of awards may fluctuate. Many satellite operators in the communications industry have continued to defer new satellite construction awards to evaluate geostationary and other competing satellite system architectures and other market factors. If we are unable to win new awards or execute existing contracts as expected, our business, results of operations and financial position could be further adversely affected. The cyclical nature of the commercial satellite market could negatively impact our ability to accurately forecast customer demand. The markets that we serve may not grow in the future and we may not be able to maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets. Specifically, sales of the 1300-class bus have historically been important to our results and there is no assurance that this market will continue to grow or demand levels will increase, nor is there assurance that the market for the smaller bus, which spans a range from 500kg to 1300kg, will offset any decreases in the market for the 1300-class bus or provide future growth. Our growth is dependent on the growth in the sales of services provided by our customers, our customers ability to anticipate market trends and our ability to anticipate changes in the businesses of our customers and to successfully identify and enter new markets. If we fail to anticipate such changes in demand, our business, results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. The satellite manufacturing industry is driven by continued investment in technologies to meet changing customer demand for complex and reliable services. Our satellite systems embody complex technologies and may not always be compatible with current and evolving technical standards and systems developed by others. Other satellite manufacturers have developed or are developing digital payloads which increase flexibility for geostationary satellites in circumstances with unpredictable demand. We plan to team with providers of this technology to enhance our offering if our customers express interest in it. Failure or delays to develop technologies or team with providers to obtain technologies to meet the requisite and evolving industry or user standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Failure of suppliers to deliver against end customer requirements could lead to a material adverse effect on our financial results within the Space Infrastructure segment.

 Our business with various governmental entities is subject to the policies, priorities, regulations, mandates and funding levels of such governmental entities and may be negatively or positively impacted by any change thereto. Changes in government policies, priorities, regulations, use of commercial data providers to meet U.S. government imagery needs, government agency mandates, funding levels through agency budget reductions, the imposition of budgetary constraints or a decline in government support or deferment of funding for programs in which we or our customers participate could result in contract terminations, delays in contract awards, reduction in contract scope, performance penalties or breaches of our contracts, the failure to exercise contract options, the cancellation of planned procurements and fewer new business opportunities, all of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are subject to the procurement policies and procedures set forth in the FAR. FAR governs all aspects of government contracting, including contractor qualifications and acquisition procedures. The FAR provisions in U.S. government contracts must be complied with in order for the contract to be awarded and provides for audits and reviews of contract procurement, performance and administration. Failure to comply with the provisions of the FAR could result in contract termination. In addition, contracts with any government, including the U.S. government, may be terminated or suspended by the government at any time and could result in significant liability obligations for us. We seek to have in place as standard provisions, termination for convenience language which reimburses us for reasonable costs incurred, subcontractor and employee termination and wind-down costs plus a reasonable amount of profit thereon. However, reparations for termination may fall short of the financial benefit associated with full completion and operation of a contract. In addition, we may not be able to procure new contracts to offset the revenue or backlog lost as a result of any termination of government contracts. The loss of one or more large contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See also Our business with various governmental entities is concentrated in a small number of primary contracts. The loss or reduction in scope of any one of our primary contracts would materially reduce our revenue below. Our revenue, results of operations and reputation may be negatively impacted if our programs fail to meet contractual requirements or our products contain defects or fail to operate in the expected manner. We sell complex and technologically advanced systems, including satellites, products, hardware and software. Sophisticated software, including software developed by us, may contain defects that can unexpectedly interfere with the software s intended operation. Defects may also occur in components and products that we manufacture or purchase from third parties. Most of the satellites and systems we have developed must function under demanding and unpredictable operating conditions and in harsh and potentially destructive environments. In addition, we may agree to the in-orbit delivery of a satellite, adding further risks to our ability to perform under a contract. Failure to achieve successful in-orbit delivery could result in significant penalties and other obligations on us. We employ sophisticated design and testing processes and practices, which include a range of stringent factory and on-site acceptance tests with criteria and requirements that are jointly developed with customers. Our systems may not be successfully implemented, pass required acceptance criteria, or operate or give the desired output, or we may not be able to detect and fix all defects in the satellites, products, hardware and software we sell or resolve any delays or availability issues in the launch services we procure. Failure to do so could result in increased costs, lost revenue and damage to our reputation and may adversely affect our ability to win new contract awards. We manufacture satellites with the intention of receiving full contractual value for builds; however, due to the inherent complexity, a number of adverse variables could negatively impact our ability to collect on the full amount of contractual consideration including circumstances where we may work in advance of customer funding. Such variables include, among others, schedule delays, including those caused by suppliers or major subcontractors, contractual disputes, failure to meet technological requirements and customer solvency concerns. These variables could lead to termination for convenience or default on our contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Historically, we have experienced significant delays in the building of certain satellites. For example, on November 22, 2022, we publicly disclosed material financial impacts of an amendment of the JUPITER 3 contract with a subsidiary of EchoStar Corporation, which was related to certain delays in the JUPITER 3 program. The schedule delays we from time to time experience in our satellite builds, some of which are 
 25 

Table of Contents 
 significant, are due to a number of factors, inclusive of COVID-19 delays, supply chain disruptions, subcontractor issues and technological requirements and we work closely with our customers to address these delays. We have, where appropriate, asserted force majeure provisions in our contracts but these can be subject to dispute. Any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, and security threats could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data, or theft or tampering of intellectual property, any of which could materially adversely impact our business. Our operations, products, solutions, analysis and intellectual property are inherently at risk of loss, unauthorized access, tampering by both insider threats and external bad actors, or disruption due to inadvertent misconfiguration of our computers and networks. In particular, our operations face various cyber and other security threats, including those caused by physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, malware, worms, attacks by hackers or foreign governments, disruptions from unauthorized access and tampering, including through social engineering such as phishing attacks, coordinated denial-of-service attacks and similar incidents. These cyber and other security threats could result in attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, intellectual property, mission operations and networks. Our systems (internal, customer and partner systems) and assets may also be subject to damage or interruption from natural and other disaster events or disruptions including tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, epidemics or pandemics, acts of domestic or foreign terrorism, workplace violence, power shortages and blackouts, aging infrastructures and telecommunications failures. In addition, threats to the safety of our directors and employees, threats to the security of our facilities, infrastructure and supply chain, or the release of misleading or deceptive information by criminal, terrorist, or other bad actors, could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our products, solutions and analysis that we develop or deliver to our customers are also at risk of disruption, loss, or tampering. The integrity of the data (e.g., pixels), information, and analysis in our products and services is at risk of being manipulated either before or after delivery to a customer. Our products with derived information characteristics are also at risk of being incorrect due to errors of deceptive practices by others. Our customers and partners (including our supply chain and joint ventures) face similar threats. Customer or partner proprietary, classified, or sensitive information stored on our networks is at risk. Assets and intellectual property and products in customer or partner environments are also inherently at risk. We also have risk where we have access to customer and partner networks and face risks of breach, disruption or loss as well. Our supply chain for products and services also is becoming more diverse and therefore the risk is growing. We have implemented certain systems and processes to help thwart bad actors and protect our data and our systems and assets. The techniques used to gain unauthorized access are constantly evolving, however, and we may be unable to prevent or mitigate all unauthorized access, disruption, loss, or harm. Because of our highly desired intellectual property and our support of the U.S. government and other governments, we (and/or partners we use) may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks by advanced, persistent and highly organized adversaries, including nation states and hostile foreign governments, such as Russia and its allies. The risk of these attacks could be exacerbated by the conflict between Russian and Ukraine discussed above. From time to time, we have experienced attacks on our systems from bad actors that, to date, have not had a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot offer assurances, however, that future attacks will not materially adversely affect our business. A security event or other significant disruption of our systems, assets, products or solutions could: disrupt the proper functioning of our networks, applications and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers, or partners; result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, our or our customers proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; destroy or degrade assets including space, ground and intellectual property assets;

 manipulate or tamper with our products, solutions, analysis, or other systems delivered to our customers or partners; compromise other sensitive government functions; and damage our reputation with our customers (particularly agencies of various governments) and the public generally. A security event that involves classified or other sensitive government information or certain controlled technical information, could subject us to civil or criminal penalties and could result in loss of our secure facility clearance and other accreditations, loss of our government contracts, loss of access to classified information, loss of export privileges or debarment as a government contractor. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of web-based products and services we offer as well as increase the number of countries within which we do business. Satellites are subject to construction and launch delays, launch failures, damage or destruction during launch, the occurrence of which can materially and adversely affect our operations. Delays in the construction of satellites and the procurement of requisite components and launch vehicles, limited availability of appropriate launch windows, possible delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, satellite damage or destruction during launch, launch failures, or incorrect orbital placement could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The loss of, or damage to, a satellite due to a launch failure could result in significant delays in anticipated revenue to be generated by that satellite. Any significant delay in the commencement of service of a satellite would delay or potentially permanently reduce the revenue anticipated to be generated by that satellite. In addition, if the loss of a satellite were to occur, such as with our loss of WorldView-4, we may not be able to accommodate affected customers with our other satellites or data from another source until a replacement satellite is available, and we may not have on hand, or be able to obtain in a timely manner, the necessary funds to cover the cost of any necessary satellite replacement. We may also dispute with customers the extent and consequences of any loss or delay. Any launch delay, launch failure, underperformance, delay or perceived delay could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business prospects and financial condition. If our satellites fail to operate as intended, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The manufacturing, testing, launching and operation of satellites involves complex processes and technology. Our satellites employ advanced technologies and sensors that are exposed to severe environmental stresses in space that have and could affect the performance of our satellites. Hardware component problems in space could lead to deterioration in performance or loss of functionality of a satellite. In addition, human operators may execute improper implementation commands that may negatively impact a satellite s performance. Exposure of our satellites to an unanticipated catastrophic event, such as a meteor shower or a collision with space debris, could reduce the performance of, or completely destroy, the affected satellite. In December 2018, our WorldView-4 satellite experienced a failure in its control moment gyros, preventing the satellite from collecting imagery. We cannot provide assurances that our satellites will continue to operate successfully in space throughout their expected operational lives. Even if a satellite is operated properly, technical flaws in that satellite s sensors or other technical deficiencies or anomalies could significantly hinder its performance, which could materially affect our ability to collect imagery and market our products and services successfully. While some anomalies are covered by insurance policies, others are not or may not be covered, or may be subject to large deductibles. If we suffer a partial or total loss of a deployed satellite, such as the failure of WorldView-4, we would need a significant amount of time and would incur substantial expense to replace that satellite. We may experience other problems with our satellites that may reduce their performance. During any period of time in which a satellite is not fully operational, we may lose most or all of the revenue that otherwise would have been derived from that satellite. Our inability to repair or replace a defective satellite or correct any other technical problem in a timely manner could result in a significant loss of revenue. If a satellite experiences a significant anomaly such that it becomes impaired or is no longer functional, it 
 27 

Table of Contents 
 would significantly impact our business, prospects and profitability. Additionally, our review of satellite lives could extend or shorten the depreciable lives of our satellites, which would have an impact on the depreciation we recognize. Loss of, or damage to, a satellite, adversarial actions impacting the function of our satellites and the failure to obtain data or alternate sources of data for our products may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In the Earth Intelligence segment, we rely on data collected from a number of sources including data obtained from satellites. We may become unable or limited in our ability to collect such data. For example, satellites can temporarily go out of service and be recovered, or cease to function for reasons beyond our control, including the quality of design and construction, the supply of fuel, the expected gradual environmental degradation of solar panels, the durability of various satellite components and the orbits and space environments in which the satellites are placed and operated. Electrostatic storms, collisions with other objects or actions by malicious actors, including cyber related, could also damage the satellites. Our satellites may be subject to an increased risk of collision with other space objects due to growth in the number of commercial and government satellites. In addition, the functioning of our satellites could be adversely impacted by potential adversarial actions that may create more space debris or through anti-satellite devices, electromagnetic or radio interference with our satellites, cyber and other security attacks, and other similar types of attacks, any or all of which are potentially capable of destroying our satellites or ground systems architecture or rendering them permanently impaired or inoperable. The risk of these malicious and adversarial actions could be exacerbated by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine discussed above. Additionally, in certain instances, governments may discontinue for periods of time the access to or operation of a satellite for any particular area on the Earth and for various reasons may not permit transmission of certain data, whether from a satellite owned by the government or not. We cannot offer assurances that each of our satellites will remain in operation. Our satellites have certain redundant systems which can fail partially or in their entirety and accordingly satellites may operate for extended periods without all redundant systems in operation, but with single points of failure. The failure of satellite components could cause damage to or loss of the use of a satellite before the end of its expected operational life. Certain of our satellites are nearing the end of their expected operational lives and we can offer no assurance that our satellites will maintain their prescribed orbits or remain operational and we may not have replacement satellites that are immediately available. Interruption or failure of our infrastructure or national infrastructure could hurt our ability to effectively perform our daily operations and provide and produce our products and services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results. We are vulnerable to natural disasters and significant disruptions including tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, epidemics or pandemics, acts of domestic or foreign terrorism, workplace violence, power shortages and blackouts, aging infrastructures and telecommunications failures. Furthermore, climate change has increased, and may continue to increase, the rate, size and scope of these natural disasters. In the event of such a natural disaster or other disruption, we could experience: disruptions to our operations or the operations of suppliers, subcontractors, distributors or customers; destruction of facilities; and/or loss of life. The availability of many of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our satellite operations infrastructure, satellite manufacturing operations, information technology, communications systems and national infrastructure. Any downtime, damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our service, which could reduce our revenue and profits. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, aging infrastructure, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm our systems. We do not currently maintain a fully comprehensive back-up production facility from which we can continue to collect, process and deliver imagery in the event of the loss of our primary facility. In the event we are unable to collect, process and deliver imagery from our facility, our daily operations and operating results would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our ground terminal centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, intentional bad acts, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, war, terrorist attacks, power losses, hardware failures, systems failures, aging infrastructure, telecommunications failures and similar events. Our satellite manufacturing operations are located in California in proximity to the San Andreas fault line, one of the longest 
 28 

Table of Contents 
 and most heavily populated earthquake-prone rifts in the world. Our satellite manufacturing facilities are also subject to risks associated with an aging infrastructure. An infrastructure failure could result in the destruction of satellites under construction or inventory, manufacturing delays or additional costs incurred. We do not maintain back-up manufacturing facilities or operations. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in lengthy interruptions in our services and/or damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our business with various governmental entities is concentrated in a small number of primary contracts. The loss or reduction in scope of any one of our primary contracts would materially reduce our revenue. Our business with various governmental entities is concentrated in a small number of primary contracts. We recognize significant revenue from U.S. government agencies and a significant amount of our U.S. government revenue is currently generated from a single contract, the EOCL Contract. On May 25, 2022, we were awarded the EOCL Contract by the National Reconnaissance Office NRO ), which is a 10-year contract worth up to 3.24 billion, inclusive of a firm 5-year base contract commitment worth 1.5 billion and 1.74 billion in exercisable options. The EOCL Contract has transitioned the imagery acquisition requirements previously addressed by the EnhancedView Contract. The EOCL Contract is a service level agreement to provide image-tasking capacity on our satellites, and other imagery-derived products and services to the U.S. government. Our ability to service other customers could be negatively impacted if we are unable to maintain our current collection capacity. In addition, any inability on our part to meet the performance requirements of the EOCL Contract could result in a performance penalty or breach of that contract. A breach of our contract with government customers or reduction in service to our other customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The U.S. government may also terminate or suspend our contracts, including the EOCL Contract, at any time with or without cause. Any changes in the size, scope or term of the EOCL Contract, could impact our satellite replenishment strategy and our ability to repay or refinance our long-term debt. Although our contracts generally involve fixed annual minimum commitments, such commitments, along with all other contracts with the U.S. government, are subject to annual Congressional appropriations and the federal budget process, and as a result, the U.S. government may not continue to fund these contracts at current or anticipated levels. Similarly, our contracts in other jurisdictions are also subject to government procurement policies and procedures. We face competition that may cause us to have to either reduce our prices for imagery and related services or to lose market share. Our services compete with satellite and aerial imagery and related services offered by a range of private and government providers. Our current or future competitors may have superior technologies or greater financial, personnel and other resources than we have. The value of our imagery may also be diluted by Earth imagery that is available free of charge. The U.S. government and foreign governments may develop, construct, launch and operate their own imagery satellites, which could reduce their need to rely on us and other commercial suppliers. In addition, such governments could sell or provide free of charge Earth imagery from their satellites and thereby compete with our imagery and related services. Also, governments may at times make our imagery freely available for humanitarian purposes, which could impair our revenue growth with non-governmental organizations. These governments could also subsidize the development, launch and operation of imagery satellites by our current or future competitors. Our competitors or potential competitors could, in the future, offer satellite-based imagery or other services with more attractive features than our services. The emergence of new remote imaging technologies or the continued growth of low-cost imaging satellites, could negatively affect our marketing efforts. More importantly, if competitors develop and launch satellites or other imagery-content sources with more advanced capabilities and technologies than ours, or offer services at lower prices than ours, our business and results of operations could be harmed. Due to competitive pricing pressures, such as new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors, the selling price of our services may further decrease. If we are unable to offset decreases in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes or by adjusting our service mix, our revenue and operating margins may decline and our financial position may be harmed.

 We operate in highly competitive industries and in various jurisdictions across the world, which may cause us to have to reduce our prices. We operate in highly competitive industries and many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than we have. Our primary competitors for satellite manufacturing contracts include the Boeing Company, Lockheed Martin Corporation and Northrop Grumman Corporation in the United States and Thales S.A. and Airbus Defence and Space, a subsidiary of the Airbus Group, in Europe. We may also face competition in the future from more emerging low-cost competitors, some of which could be subsidized or well-funded. Competition in our Earth Intelligence segment is highly diverse, and while our competitors offer different products, there is often competition for contracts that are part of governmental budgets. Our major existing and potential competitors for our Earth Intelligence segment include commercial satellite imagery companies, state-owned imagery providers, aerial imagery companies, free sources of imagery and unmanned aerial vehicles. Our Earth Intelligence segment faces competition from companies that provide geospatial analytic information and services to the U.S. government, including defense prime contractors such as L3Harris and Booz Allen Hamilton. In addition, some of our foreign competitors currently benefit from, and others may benefit in the future from, protective measures by their home countries where governments are providing financial support, including significant investments in the development of new technologies. Government support of this nature greatly reduces the commercial risks associated with satellite development activities for these competitors. This market environment may result in increased pressures on our pricing and other competitive factors. Uncertain global macro-economic and political conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our results of operations are materially affected by economic and political conditions in the United States and internationally, including inflation, rising interest rates, availability of capital, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, energy and commodity prices, trade laws, the spread of infectious diseases and governmental responses thereto, the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions, geopolitical tensions and military conflicts, such as the current situation in Ukraine. Current or potential customers may delay or decrease spending on our products and services as their business and/or budgets are impacted by economic conditions. The inability of current and potential customers to pay us for our products and services may adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. We are a party to legal proceedings, investigations and other claims or disputes, which are costly to defend and, if determined adversely to us, could require us to pay fines or damages, undertake remedial measures or prevent us from taking certain actions, any of which could adversely affect our business. We are, and in the future may be, a party to legal proceedings, investigations and other claims or disputes, which may relate to subjects including commercial transactions, intellectual property, securities, employee relations, or compliance with applicable laws and regulations. For instance, in January 2019, a Maxar stockholder filed a putative class action lawsuit in the Federal District Court of Colorado, naming Maxar and members of management as defendants alleging, among other things, that our public disclosures were false or misleading in violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and seeking monetary damages. An amended consolidated complaint was filed in that case in October 2019. In September 2020, the court granted in part, and denied in part, Maxar s motion to dismiss. In July 2021, the Federal District Court of Colorado certified a class consisting of investors who purchased or acquired Maxar stock between May 9, 2018 and October 30, 2018, inclusive. The parties have reached an agreement to resolve the action on a class-wide basis for a one-time payment of 27 million, to be funded by insurance maintained by Maxar. The agreement is contingent on Court approval. As part of the Court approval process, class members will have an opportunity to object to, or opt-out of, the settlement pursuant to procedures established by the Court. Also, in January 2019, a Maxar stockholder resident in Canada issued a putative class action lawsuit in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice against Maxar and members of management claiming misrepresentations in our public disclosures and seeking monetary damages under Canadian securities laws. In November 2019, a second putative class action lawsuit was issued by the same Maxar stockholder resident in Canada, adding a second representative plaintiff and three additional defendants. In February 2020, the January 2019 Canadian

 lawsuit was discontinued. And, in March 2022, the November 2019 Canadian lawsuit was dismissed against all of the Maxar defendants. The plaintiffs have not appealed the dismissal and the time period for such appeal expired in April 2022. In October 2019, a Maxar stockholder filed a putative class action lawsuit in California state court, naming Maxar and certain members of management and the Board of Directors as defendants. The lawsuit is based upon many of the same underlying factual allegations as the federal class action but asserts claims under the Securities Act of 1933. An amended complaint was filed in April 2020. In November 2020, defendants filed a demurrer to the operative complaint, and in January 2021, the court largely overruled the demurrer. On August 20, 2021, the court certified a class consisting of investors who acquired Maxar stock in exchange for DigitalGlobe stock pursuant to the Company s June 2, 2017 Registration Statement and Prospectus issued in connection with Maxar s October 2017 acquisition of DigitalGlobe. In November 2019, a purported derivative complaint was filed against Maxar, certain current and former members of management and the Board of Directors in the Federal District Court of Delaware, also based on the same factual allegations as the federal putative class action. In September 2020, a second purported derivative case was filed in the Federal District Court of Delaware, based on the same allegations as the earlier derivative case. The two derivative cases pending in the Federal District Court of Delaware have been consolidated and are stayed. In September 2021, a third purported derivative complaint was filed against Maxar, certain current and former members of management and the Board of Directors in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, also based on the same factual allegations as the federal class action. In November 2021, the parties stipulated to a stay of this action. These legal proceedings could result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources and could harm our stock price, business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. These and other legal proceedings and investigations are inherently uncertain and we cannot predict their duration, scope, outcome or consequences. There can be no assurance that these or any such matters that have been or may in the future be brought against us will be resolved favorably. In connection with any government investigations, in the event the government takes action against us or the parties resolve or settle the matter, we may be required to pay substantial fines or civil and criminal penalties and/or be subject to equitable remedies, including disgorgement or injunctive relief. Other legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits filed by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence. These matters are likely to be expensive and time-consuming to defend, settle and/or resolve and may require us to implement certain remedial measures that could prove costly or disruptive to our business and operations. They may also cause damage to our business reputation. The unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We are dependent on our ability to attract, train and retain employees. Our inability to do so, or the loss of key personnel, would cause serious harm to our business. Our success is largely dependent on the abilities and experience of our executive officers and other key personnel to oversee all aspects of our operations and to deliver on our corporate strategies. Competition for highly skilled management, technical, research and development and other personnel is intense in our industry. In order to maintain our ability to compete, we must continuously retain the services of a core group of specialists in a wide variety of disciplines. To the extent that the demand for qualified personnel exceeds supply, we have and could in the future experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees, or could experience difficulties in performing under contracts if our need for such employees is unmet. We may not be able to retain our current executive officers or key personnel or attract and retain additional executive officers or key personnel as needed to deliver on our corporate strategy. Furthermore, the recent volatility in our stock price may undermine the use of our equity as a retention tool and may make it more difficult to retain key personnel. Acquisitions or divestitures could result in adverse impacts on our operations. In order to grow our business, we may acquire additional assets or companies, including for example, our Vricon Acquisition completed on July 1, 2020. In connection with the Vricon Acquisition or any future acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, acquire, or obtain the required regulatory approvals, or profitably manage the additional businesses or successfully integrate any acquired businesses, products or technologies without substantial expenses, delays or other operational, regulatory, or financial problems. In addition, any acquired businesses, products or technologies may not achieve anticipated revenues and income growth.

Table of Contents 
 Further, acquisitions may involve a number of additional risks, including diversion of management s attention, failure to retain key personnel, or failure to attract the necessary talent to manage organizational growth. We may become responsible for unexpected liabilities that were not discovered or disclosed in the course of due diligence in connection with historical acquisitions and any future acquisitions. Additionally, acquisitions with international operations such as the Vricon Acquisition with operations in Sweden, expose us to greater international business risks. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of an acquisition, such as revenue gains or cost reductions, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may also seek to divest portions of our businesses which may no longer be aligned with our strategic initiatives and long-term objectives. Various factors could materially affect our ability to successfully do so, including the availability of buyers willing to purchase the assets on terms acceptable to us, difficulties in the separation of operations, the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns, the disruption of our business, the potential loss of key employees and the retention of uncertain contingent liabilities related to the divested business. We cannot assure that we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business or product line, and any divestiture we undertake could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Disruptions in U.S. government operations and funding could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Any disruptions in federal government operations could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. A prolonged failure to maintain significant U.S. government operations, particularly those pertaining to our business, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Continued uncertainty related to recent and future U.S. federal government shutdowns, the U.S. budget including the federal debt ceiling and/or failure of the U.S. government to enact annual appropriations, such as long-term funding under a continuing resolution, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Further, if the federal debt ceiling is not raised, the U.S. could default on its debt which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows which are difficult to predict. The current split control of the U.S. government increases these risks. Additionally, disruptions in federal government operations may negatively impact regulatory approvals and guidance that are important to our operations. Changes in U.S. government policy regarding use of commercial data or space infrastructure providers, or material delay or cancellation of certain U.S. government programs, may have a material adverse effect on our revenue and our ability to achieve our growth objectives. Current U.S. government policy encourages the U.S. government s use of commercial data and Space Infrastructure providers to support U.S. national security objectives. Under the EOCL Contract, our contractual counterparty acquires imagery and imagery-derived products on behalf of our customers within the U.S. government. We are considered by the U.S. government to be a commercial data provider. U.S. government policy is subject to change and any change in policy away from supporting the use of commercial data and Space Infrastructure providers to meet U.S. government imagery and Space Infrastructure needs, or any material delay or cancellation of planned U.S. government programs, including the EOCL Contract, could materially adversely affect our revenue and our ability to achieve our growth objectives. Our business involves significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by insurance. A significant portion of our business relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced space technology products and systems. New technologies may be untested or unproven. Failure of some of these products and services could result in extensive property damage. Accordingly, we may incur liabilities that are unique to our products and services. We endeavor to obtain insurance coverage from established insurance carriers to cover these risks and liabilities. However, the amount of insurance coverage that we maintain may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities. 
 32 

Table of Contents 
 Existing coverage may be canceled while we remain exposed to the risk and it is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks, natural hazards and liabilities. We have historically insured satellites in our constellation to the extent that insurance was available on acceptable premiums and other terms. The insurance proceeds received in connection with a partial or total loss of the functional capacity of any of our satellites would not be sufficient to cover the replacement cost, if we choose to do so, of an equivalent high-resolution satellite. In addition, this insurance will not protect us against all losses to our satellites due to specified exclusions, deductibles and material change limitations customary in the industry. Exclusions generally include, for example, acts of war or other hostile actions for which exclusions are customary in the industry at the time the policy is written. In the event we experience potential adversarial actions that destroy or impair the operability or functioning of any of our satellites, whether through actions creating more space debris or through anti-satellite devices, electromagnetic or radio interference with our satellites, cyber and other security attacks affecting our satellites or ground systems architecture, or other similar types of attacks, there can be no assurance that any insurance proceeds will be available for any partial or total loss of a satellite or a satellite s performance. In addition, it may be difficult or impossible to insure against certain risks, including a partial deterioration in satellite performance and satellite re-entry. The price and availability of insurance fluctuate significantly. Although we have historically been able to obtain insurance coverage for in-orbit satellites, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future. We intend to maintain insurance for our operating satellites, but any determination we make as to whether to obtain insurance coverage will depend on a variety of factors, including the availability of insurance in the market, the cost of available insurance and the redundancy of our operating satellites. Insurance market conditions or factors outside our control at the time we are in the market for the required insurance, such as failure of a satellite using similar components, could cause premiums to be significantly higher than current estimates and could reduce amounts of available coverage. The cost of our insurance has been increasing and may continue to increase. Higher premiums on insurance policies will reduce our operating income by the amount of such increased premiums. If the terms of in-orbit insurance policies become less favorable than those currently available, there may be limits on the amount of coverage that we can obtain, or we may not be able to obtain insurance at all. In addition, even though we carry business interruption insurance policies, any business interruption losses could exceed the coverage available or be excluded from our insurance policies, which include customary exclusions such as acts of war, among others. Any disruption of our ability to operate our business could result in a material decrease in our revenues or significant additional costs to replace, repair or insure our assets, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We often rely on a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key products or services and the inability of these key vendors to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our business. Historically, we have contracted with a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key products or services, such as construction of satellites and launch vehicles and management of certain remote ground terminals and direct access facilities. In addition, our manufacturing operations depend on specific technologies and companies for which there may be a limited number of vendors. We are increasingly dependent upon subcontractors and suppliers which subjects our business and results of operations to risks of supplier interruption. If these vendors are unable to meet our needs because they fail to perform adequately, are unable to match new technological requirements or opportunities, or are unable to dedicate engineering and other resources necessary to provide the services contracted for, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. While alternative sources for these products, services and technologies may exist, we may not be able to develop these alternative sources quickly and cost-effectively, which could materially impair our ability to operate our business. Furthermore, these vendors may request changes in pricing, payment terms or other contractual obligations, which could cause us to make substantial additional investments. Additionally, some of our suppliers employees are represented by labor unions. Labor union actions at suppliers can also affect us. Work stoppages and instability in our relationships with labor unions could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationships with customers, cause a loss of revenues and adversely affect our operations.

 Disruptions in the supply of key raw materials or components and difficulties in the supplier qualification process, as well as increases in prices of raw materials, could adversely impact us. Many raw materials, major components and product equipment items, particularly in our Space Infrastructure segment, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source basis. Although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that near-term sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. Supply shortages related to electronic chips is an example of some of the challenges we may face with materials. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations and damage to customer relationships and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. Key raw materials used in our operations include metals such as aluminum and titanium, which are usually procured by our suppliers who manufacture parts in accordance with our drawings. We also purchase materials such as chemicals; composites; electronic, electro-mechanical and mechanical components; subassemblies; and subsystems that are integrated with the manufactured parts for final assembly into finished products and systems. We are impacted by increases in the prices of raw materials used in production on fixed-price business. We monitor sources of supply to attempt to assure that adequate raw materials and other supplies needed in manufacturing processes are available. We have experienced and may continue to experience significant difficulty in our ability to procure certain raw materials, components, sub-assemblies and other supplies required in our manufacturing processes. Prolonged disruptions in the supply of any of our key raw materials or components, difficulty completing qualification of new sources of supply, implementing use of replacement materials, components or new sources of supply, or a continuing increase in the prices of raw materials, energy or components could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. We are dependent on resellers of our services for a portion of our revenue. If these resellers fail to market or sell our services successfully, our business could be harmed. The Earth Intelligence segment has historically generated a portion of its revenue from foreign and domestic resellers. In the Earth Intelligence segment, we rely on foreign resellers and partners to market and sell the majority of our services in the international market. Our foreign resellers and partners may not have the skill or experience to develop regional commercial markets for our services, or may have competing interests that negatively affect their sales of our services. If we fail to enter into reseller agreements on a timely basis or if our resellers and partners fail to market and sell our services successfully, these failures could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be successful in developing new technology and the technology we are successful in developing may not meet the needs of our customers or potential new customers. The markets in which we operate are characterized by changing technology and evolving industry standards. Despite years of experience in meeting customer systems requirements with the latest in technological solutions, we may not be successful in identifying, developing and marketing products or systems that respond to rapid technological change, evolving technical standards and systems developed by others. Our competitors may develop technology that better meets the needs of our customers. If we do not continue to develop, manufacture and market innovative technologies or applications that meet customers requirements, sales may suffer and our business may not continue to grow in line with historical rates or at all. If we are unable to achieve sustained growth, we may be unable to execute our business strategy, expand our business or fund other liquidity needs and our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

 Our technology may violate the proprietary rights of third parties and our intellectual property may be misappropriated or infringed upon by third parties, each of which could have a negative impact on our operations. If any of our technology violates proprietary rights, including copyrights and patents, third parties may assert infringement claims against us. Certain software modules and other intellectual property used by us or in our satellites, systems and products make use of or incorporate licensed software components and other licensed technology. These components are developed by third parties over whom we have no control. Any claims brought against us may result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims. We may be required to redesign our satellites, systems or products or to obtain licenses from third parties to continue offering our satellites, systems or products without substantially re-engineering such products or systems. Our intellectual property rights may be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, infringed or required to be licensed to others. An infringement or misappropriation could harm any competitive advantage we currently derive or may derive from our proprietary rights. To protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patent protections, copyrights, trade secrets, trademark laws, confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties and protective contractual provisions such as those contained in license agreements with consultants, subcontractors, vendors and customers. Although we apply rigorous standards, documents and processes to protect our intellectual property, there is no absolute assurance that the steps taken to protect our technology will prevent misappropriation or infringement. Litigation may be necessary to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute or defend and could result in the diversion of our time and resources. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. The acceptance of our imagery services may not continue and our historic growth rates should not be relied upon as an indicator of future growth. We cannot accurately predict the extent of the market acceptance of our services or whether there will continue to be a market for our services on terms we find acceptable. Market acceptance of our commercial high-resolution Earth imagery and related services depends on a number of factors, including the quality, scope, timeliness, sophistication, price and the availability of substitute services. Changes in the market acceptance of our offerings, or other services that utilize our imagery, failure of new markets to develop, the impact of competitive conditions, or our need to make significant investments to achieve acceptance by the market would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not continue to grow in line with historical rates or at all. If we are unable to achieve sustained growth, we may be unable to execute our business strategy, expand our business or fund other liquidity needs and our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We are unable to predict the extent to which the global COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemics, epidemics or infectious disease outbreaks may adversely impact our business operations, financial performance, results of operations and stock price. Our business and operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has also caused significant disruption in the operations of third parties upon whom we rely. Our supply chain is under stress inside and outside of the U.S., and we continue to monitor and assess the actual and potential COVID-19 or related force majeure impacts on the supply chain, our operations and customer commitments. There is a risk that these schedule delays could result in obligations for material liquidated damages owed to our customers. We have received some force majeure claims from suppliers related to COVID-19; however, at this time we do not expect the claims to result in a material financial impact. Future outbreaks of COVID-19 or other pandemics, epidemics or infectious diseases may further disrupt our supply chain. From time to time, we have experienced, and could in the future experience, a variation in the consumption of access minutes by our customers as a result of COVID-19, or other pandemics, epidemics or infectious outbreaks and the preventative measures instituted by governments and businesses to mitigate their spread, which resulted, and may in the future result, in periods of business slowdown. This impact could be more significant in the future, which could 
 35 

Table of Contents 
 negatively impact revenue. In many instances, COVID-19 represents a force majeure event and as such, we have notified certain customers that we will be exercising our contractual legal rights, and in some instances we have made claims exercising such rights, given the uncertain nature of the current pandemic and its near and long-term impacts on the cost and schedule of the numerous programs in our existing backlog. Additionally, our customers may slow down their development of new projects or may experience financial difficulties impacting their ability to fund projects already in backlog as a result of COVID-19, or other pandemics, epidemics or infectious disease outbreaks. We cannot predict the degree to which, or the time period that, global economic conditions, the global supply chain and our sales and operations will be affected by COVID-19 or other pandemics, epidemics or infectious diseases and preventative measures imposed from time to time by governments and businesses to prevent their spread. The degree to which COVID-19 or other pandemics, epidemics or infectious disease outbreaks could impact us will depend on numerous factors and future developments that are difficult to predict. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or another pandemic, epidemic or infectious disease outbreak on our business, sales, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be material. Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, those relating to our critical accounting policies of revenue recognition, including our long-term contracts accounted for utilizing the cost-to-cost method and income taxes in addition to other estimates related to restructuring costs, recoverability of assets including customer receivables, valuation of goodwill and intangibles, contingencies and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. These assumptions and estimates involve the exercise of judgment and discretion, which may evolve over time in light of operational experience, regulatory direction, developments in accounting principles and other factors. Actual results could differ from these estimates as a result of changes in circumstances, assumptions, policies or developments in the business, which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements. We may be required to recognize impairment charges. Long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets, are tested annually for impairment in the fourth quarter or whenever there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. In the past, we have recognized significant impairment losses related to goodwill, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, inventory and orbital receivables. Disruptions to our business, unexpected significant declines in our operating results, adverse technological events or changes in the regulatory markets in which we operate, and significant declines in our stock price have resulted and may result in further impairment charges to our tangible and intangible assets. Any future impairment charges could substantially affect our reported results. Pension and other postretirement benefit obligations may materially impact our earnings, stockholders equity and cash flows from operations, and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods. We maintain defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits plans for some of our employees. Potential pension contributions include discretionary contributions to improve the plans funded status. The extent of future contributions depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions, annual pension and other postretirement costs, the value of plan assets and our benefit obligations. 
 36 

Table of Contents 
 Significant changes in actual return on pension assets, discount rates and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our expected asset returns can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. With regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. We also provide other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, consisting principally of health care, dental and life insurance for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including estimates of the level of medical cost increases and discount rates. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could have a negative impact on our business. Our revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars for the purposes of compiling our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have in the past and may in the future, use hedging strategies to manage and minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our cash flow and economic profits. There are complexities inherent in determining whether and when foreign exchange exposures will materialize, in particular given the possibility of unpredictable revenue variations arising from schedule delays and contract postponements. Furthermore, if we use hedging strategies in the future, we could be exposed to the risk of non-performance of our hedging counterparties. We may also have difficulty with our hedging strategy in the future depending on the willingness of hedging counterparties to extend credit. Accordingly, no assurances may be given that our exchange rate hedging strategy would protect us from significant changes or fluctuations in revenues and expenses denominated in U.S. dollars. Our restructuring activities and cost saving initiatives may not achieve the results we anticipate. We have previously and may in the future undertake cost reduction initiatives and organizational restructurings to improve operating efficiencies, optimize our asset base and generate cost savings. We cannot be certain that these initiatives have been or will be completed as planned or without business interruption, that these initiatives will not generate additional costs, such as severance or other charges, or that the estimated operating efficiencies or cost savings from such activities will be fully realized or maintained over time. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Our Common Stock Our business is capital intensive, and we may not be able to raise adequate capital to finance our business strategies, including funding future satellites, or to refinance or renew our debt financing arrangements, or we may be able to do so only on terms that significantly restrict our ability to operate our business. The implementation of our business strategies, such as expanding our satellite constellation and our products and services offerings, requires a substantial outlay of capital. As we pursue our business strategies and seek to respond to opportunities and trends in our industry, our actual capital expenditures may differ from our expected capital expenditures, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy our capital requirements in the future. We are highly leveraged, but we currently expect that our ongoing liquidity requirements for sustaining our operations will be satisfied by cash on hand and cash generated from our existing and future operations supplemented, where necessary, by available credit. However, we cannot provide assurances that our businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future or that additional capital will be available in amounts sufficient to enable us to execute our business strategies or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to refinance or increase our debt financing and/or renew existing credit facilities may be limited by our existing financial and non-financial covenants, credit objectives, or the conditions of the debt capital market generally. Furthermore, our current financing arrangements contain certain restrictive financial and non-financial covenants (e.g., the achievement or maintenance of stated financial ratios) that may impact our access to those facilities and significantly limit future operating and financial flexibility.

 Finally, the recent Russian military actions and the resulting sanctions have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect the global economy and financial markets leading to significant volatility and instability and lack of liquidity in capital markets, potentially making it more difficult for us to raise adequate capital to finance our business strategies, refinance or increase our debt financing, and/or renew existing credit facilities. See also Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by impacts resulting from the conflict in Ukraine or any other geopolitical tensions above . Our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing or government grants to finance operating working capital requirements and growth initiatives may be limited or difficult to obtain, which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. We need capital to finance operating working capital requirements and growth initiatives and to pay our outstanding debt obligations as they become due for payment. If the cash generated from our businesses, together with the credit available under existing bank facilities, is not sufficient to fund future capital requirements, we will require additional debt or equity financing. Our ability to access capital markets on terms that are acceptable to us will be dependent on prevailing market conditions, as well as our future financial condition. Further, our ability to refinance or increase our debt financing and/or renew existing facilities may be limited by our existing leverage, financial and non-financial covenants, credit objectives and debt capital market conditions. We have in the past, and may continue in the future to, receive government grants for research and development activities and other business initiatives. Any agreement or grant of this nature with government may be accompanied by contractual obligations applicable to us, which may result in the grant money becoming repayable if certain requirements are not met. A failure to meet contractual obligations under such agreements and grants and a consequent requirement to repay money received could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. Our indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, our ability to operate our business, our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments. We have a significant amount of indebtedness and leverage. Our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of, interest on, or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness. Our long-term debt under our Syndicated Credit Facility bears interest at floating rates related to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR (for U.S. dollar borrowings), plus a margin. As a result, our interest payment obligations on such indebtedness will increase if such interest rates increase to the extent these changes are not mitigated by our interest rate swaps. Our leverage and debt service obligations could adversely impact our business, including by: impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratios contained in our credit facilities or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal, including periodic principal payments; increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all; requiring the dedication of a portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, dividends to stockholders or to pursue future business opportunities; requiring us to sell debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we compete; and placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources. Any of the forgoing factors could have negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operation.

 Our current financing arrangements contain certain restrictive covenants that impact our future operating and financial flexibility. Our current financing arrangements contain certain restrictive covenants that may impact our future operating and financial flexibility. Our debt funding is provided under our financing agreements, which contains a series of positive and negative covenants with which we must comply, including financial and non-financial covenants. If we fail to comply with any covenants and are unable to obtain a waiver or other cure thereof, the lenders under the Syndicated Credit Facility or the holders of the 7.75 2027 Notes or 7.54 2027 Notes (as such terms are defined below) may be able to take certain actions with respect to the amounts owing under such agreements or notes, as applicable, including requiring early payment thereof. Any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. These covenants could also have the effect of limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete. Our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance. From time to time, we release guidance regarding our future performance that represents our management s estimates as of the date of release. This guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is prepared by our management and is qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in the release. Our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither any independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles, examines or reviews the guidance and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. Guidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, is inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of these ranges. The principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons. Guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results, particularly any guidance relating to the results of operations of acquired businesses or companies as our management will be less familiar with their business, procedures and operations. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results will vary from the guidance and the variations may be material. Investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data will diminish the farther in the future that the data are forecast. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it. Any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could result in the actual operating results being different than the guidance, and such differences may be adverse and material. We could be adversely impacted by actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could impact the value of our securities. We value constructive input from our stockholders and the investment community. However, there is no assurance that the actions taken by our Board of Directors and management in seeking to maintain constructive engagement with our stockholders will be successful. Certain of our stockholders have expressed views with respect to the operation of our business, our business strategy, corporate governance considerations or other matters. Responding to actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. The perceived uncertainties as to our future direction due to activist actions could affect the market price

 of our stock, result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, board members and business partners. The price of our common stock has been volatile and may fluctuate substantially. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE and the TSX and the price for our common stock has historically been volatile. The market price of our common stock may continue to be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to the following factors (in addition to the other risk factors described in this section): general economic conditions; fluctuations in our operating results; variance in our financial performance from the expectations of equity and/or debt research analysts; techniques employed by short sellers to drive down the market price of our common stock; conditions and trends in the markets we serve; additions of or changes to key employees; changes in market valuations or earnings of our competitors; trading volumes of our common stock; future sales of our equity securities and/or future issuances of indebtedness; changes in the estimation of the future sizes and growth rates of our markets; and legislation or regulatory policies, practices or actions. In addition, the stock markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have at times been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. Technical factors in the public trading market for our common stock may produce price movements that may or may not comport with macro, industry or company-specific fundamentals, including, without limitation, the sentiment of retail investors (including as may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites), the amount and status of short interest in our common stock, access to margin debt and trading in options and other derivatives on our common stock. These market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock irrespective of our operating performance. A significant or prolonged decrease in our market capitalization, including a decline in stock price, or a negative long-term performance outlook, could result in an impairment of our assets which results when the carrying value of our assets exceed their fair value. In the past several years, our securities have been the subject of short selling. Reports and information have been published about us that we believe are mischaracterized or incorrect, and which have in the past been followed by a decline in our stock price. If there are short seller allegations in the future, we may have to expend a significant amount of resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend ourselves. In addition, in 2019, we became subject to certain securities class action litigation as a result of volatility in the price of our common stock, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources and could harm our stock price, business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. See Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. If securities or industry analysts discontinue publishing research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.

 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may impede or discourage a takeover, changes in management or changes in the Board of Directors, which could reduce the market price of our common stock. Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a third-party from acquiring control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. These provisions include: no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; the exclusive right of the Board of Directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on the Board of Directors; the ability of the Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer; a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders; the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the Board of Directors or two or more stockholders who hold, in the aggregate, at least ten percent (10 of the voting power of our outstanding shares, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; a supermajority vote of our stockholders to amend our amended and restated bylaws and certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation; and advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to the Board of Directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our business. 
 These provisions could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against our directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision ). Our amended and restated bylaws further provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended Federal Forum Provision ). The Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision is intended to apply to claims arising under Delaware state law and would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, the Federal Forum Provision is intended to apply to claims arising under the Securities Act and would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the Exchange Act. These exclusive forum provisions will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder and, accordingly, actions by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder must be brought in federal courts. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with the company or its directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against the Company and its directors, officers and other employees. In addition, stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware pursuant to the Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The court in the designated forum under our exclusive forum provisions may also reach different judgments on results than would other courts,

Table of Contents 
 including courts where a stockholder would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to the Company than to our stockholders. Further, the enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies organizational documents has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find any of our exclusive forum provisions to be inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings. If a court were to find all or any part of our exclusive forum provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we might incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock. Our Board of Directors significantly reduced our dividends in the first quarter of 2019. Although our Board of Directors has historically declared a quarterly cash dividend which we have paid, the payment of future dividends is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and we may not pay quarterly dividends in the same amounts or at all in the future. The declaration, amount and timing of cash dividends are subject to capital availability and determinations by our Board of Directors that such dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and applicable agreements. Our ability to pay dividends will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions, debt service requirements, results of operations, financial condition and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. The elimination of our dividend payments and/or our dividend program could have a negative effect on our stock price. Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters Our operations in the U.S. government market are subject to significant regulatory risk. Our operations in the U.S. government market are subject to significant government regulation. A failure by us to maintain the relevant clearances and approvals could limit our ability to operate in the U.S. market. Further, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be awarded contracts by the U.S. government. In addition, a failure by us to keep current and compliant with relevant U.S. regulations could result in fines, penalties, repayments, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time and could have an adverse effect on our standing and eligibility for future U.S. government contracts. Failure to comply with the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual could result in interruption, delay or suspension of our ability to provide our products and services, and could result in loss of current and future business with the U.S. government. We and our subsidiaries are parties to certain contracts with various departments and agencies of the U.S. government, including the U.S. Department of Defense, which require that certain of our legal entities be issued facility security clearances under the National Industrial Security Program. The National Industrial Security Program requires that a corporation maintaining a facility security clearance be effectively insulated from foreign ownership, control or influence FOCI ). We have entered into a Board Resolution to mitigate remaining FOCI risks as seen by the U.S. government. Failure to maintain an agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense regarding the appropriate FOCI mitigation arrangement could result in invalidation or termination of the facility security clearances, which in turn would mean that our U.S. subsidiaries would not be able to enter into future contracts with the U.S. government requiring facility security clearances, and may result in the loss of the ability of those subsidiaries to complete existing contracts with the U.S. government. Our business is subject to various regulatory risks that could adversely affect our operations. The environment in which we operate is highly regulated due to the sensitive nature of our complex and technologically advanced systems, including satellites, products, hardware and software, in addition to those regulations broadly 
 42 

Table of Contents 
 applicable to publicly listed corporations. There are numerous regulatory risks that could adversely affect operations, including but not limited to: Changes in laws and regulations. It is possible that the laws and regulations governing our business and operations will change in the future. A substantial portion of our revenue is generated from customers outside of the U.S. There may be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations if we are required to alter our business to comply with changes in both domestic and foreign regulations, telecommunications standards, foreign policy, tariffs or taxes and other trade barriers that reduce or restrict our ability to sell our products and services on a global basis, or by political and economic instability in the countries in which we conduct business. Any failure to comply with such regulatory requirements could also subject us to various fines, penalties or sanctions. Export Restrictions. Certain of our businesses and satellites, systems, products, services or technologies we have developed require the implementation or acquisition of products or technologies from third parties, including those in other jurisdictions. In addition, certain of our satellites, systems, products or technologies may be required to be forwarded or exported to other jurisdictions. In certain cases, if the use of the technologies can be viewed by the jurisdiction in which that supplier or subcontractor resides as being subject to export constraints or restrictions relating to national security, we may not be able to obtain the technologies and products that we require from suppliers or subcontractors who would otherwise be our preferred choice or may not be able to obtain the export permits necessary to transfer or export our technology. To the extent that we are able, we obtain pre-authorization for re-export prior to signing contracts which oblige us to export subject technologies, including specific foreign government approval as needed. In the event of export restrictions, we may have the ability through contract force majeure provisions to be excused from our obligations. Notwithstanding these provisions, the inability to obtain export approvals, export restrictions or changes during contract execution or non-compliance by our customers could have an adverse effect on our revenues and margins. U.S. Government Approval Requirements. For certain aspects of our business operations, we are required to obtain U.S. government licenses and approvals to enter into agreements or engage in commercial transactions with various end users (including government bodies) in order to export satellites and related equipment, disclose technical data or provide defense services to foreign persons. The delayed receipt of or the failure to obtain the necessary U.S. government licenses, approvals and agreements may prohibit entry into or interrupt the completion of contracts which could lead to a customer s termination of a contract for default, monetary penalties and/or the loss of incentive payments. Competitive Impact of U.S. Regulations on Satellite Sales. Some of our customers and potential customers, along with insurance underwriters and brokers, have asserted that U.S. export control laws and regulations governing disclosures to foreign persons excessively restrict their access to information about the satellite during construction and on-orbit. Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC sanctions and requirements may also limit certain business opportunities or delay or restrict our ability to contract with potential foreign customers or operators. To the extent that our non-U.S. competitors are not subject to OFAC or similar export control or economic sanctions laws and regulations, they may enjoy a competitive advantage with foreign customers, and it could become increasingly difficult for the U.S. satellite manufacturing industry, including us, to recapture this lost market share. Customers concerned over the possibility that the U.S. government may deny the export license necessary for us to deliver their purchased satellite to them, or the restrictions or delays imposed by the U.S. government licensing requirements, even where an export license is granted, may elect to choose a satellite that is purportedly free of International Traffic in Arms Regulations ITAR offered by a non-U.S. supplier. We are further disadvantaged by the fact that a purportedly ITAR-free satellite may be launched less expensively in China on the Chinese Long March rocket, a launch vehicle that, because of ITAR restrictions, is not available to us. Anti-Corruption Laws. As part of the regulatory and legal environments in which we operate, we are subject to global anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments directly or indirectly to government officials, authorities or persons defined in those anti-corruption laws in order to obtain or retain business or other 
 43 

Table of Contents 
 improper advantages in the conduct of business. Our policies mandate compliance with anti-corruption laws. Failure by our employees, agents, subcontractors, suppliers and/or partners to comply with anti-corruption laws could impact us in various ways that include, but are not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative fines and/or legal sanctions and the inability to bid for or enter into contracts with certain entities, all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our reputation, operations and financial results. 
 Changes in tax law, in our tax rates or in exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Changes in law and policy relating to taxes, including those with retroactive effect, may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These changes may alter existing tax law, such as increasing the corporate tax rate and enacting a minimum tax on worldwide book income. We continue to monitor tax law developments and assess the impact on the Company. For example, on August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA 2022 which, among other things, creates a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax on profits of corporations whose average annual adjusted financial statement income over a three-year period exceeds 1 billion and creates an excise tax of 1 on stock repurchases by publicly traded U.S. corporations. These provisions of the IRA 2022 are generally effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. We continue to evaluate the future impacts of these provisions, if we become subject to additional taxes it could adversely affect our financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows. The U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 2017 Tax Act on December 22, 2017, which significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations. The 2017 Tax Act remains unclear in many respects and has been, and may continue to be, the subject of amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the Treasury and IRS, which have mitigated or increased certain adverse impacts of the 2017 Tax Act and may continue to do so in the future. Our ability to use our U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 310 million, 875 million and 4 million of federal, state and foreign net operating loss NOL carryforwards and 85 million of U.S. tax credit carryforwards primarily related to research and development expenditures, net of unrecognized tax benefits. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended Code ), if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, the corporation s ability to use its pre-change U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an ownership change occurs if there is a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in a corporation s equity ownership by certain stockholders over a rolling three-year period. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply to limit our use of accumulated state tax attributes. While we do not believe that we have experienced ownership changes in the past that would materially limit our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards, the Section 382 rules are complex and there is no assurance our view is correct. In the event that we experience ownership changes in the future, our ability to use pre-change NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset post-change taxable income will be subject to limitations. As a result, we may be unable to use a material portion of our NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes, which could adversely affect our future cash flows. Our operations are subject to governmental law and regulations relating to environmental matters, which may expose us to significant costs and liabilities that could negatively impact our financial condition. We are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the operation of our businesses, including those governing pollution, the handling, storage, disposal and transportation of hazardous substances and the ownership and operation of real property. In addition, we could be affected by future regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change, other aspects of the environment or natural resources. We have been designated, along with other companies, as a named discharger potentially responsible for the cleanup of 
 44 

Table of Contents 
 groundwater contamination at certain sites in California where we operate and there can be no assurance that the previous owners of those properties strictly complied with such environmental laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations may result in significant liabilities and costs to us due to the actions or inactions of the previous owners. In addition, new laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could result in additional costs. We have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs and demands in order to comply with laws and regulations applicable to public companies. In January 2019, we became a domestic issuer for SEC reporting purposes and a reporting issuer in each of the jurisdictions in Canada in which Maxar Canada was a reporting issuer. The obligations of being a public company in the U.S. and Canada require significant expenditures and will place significant demands on our management and other personnel, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, applicable Canadian securities laws, and the rules and regulations regarding corporate governance practices, including those under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the listing requirements of the NYSE and the TSX. These rules require that we maintain effective disclosure and financial controls and procedures, internal control over financial reporting and changes in corporate governance practices, among many other complex rules that are often difficult to monitor and maintain compliance with. Additionally, new standards, as well as investor expectations are developing around ESG and other emerging socioeconomic trends and matters, which require continual monitoring and compliance. Our management and other personnel will continue to devote a substantial amount of time to ensure compliance with all of these requirements and to keep pace with new regulations, otherwise we may fall out of compliance and risk becoming subject to reputational damage, litigation or being delisted, among other potential problems. Our international business exposes us to risks relating to regulation, currency fluctuations and political or economic instability in foreign markets, which could adversely affect our revenue, earnings, cash flows and our financial condition. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from non-U.S. sales, and we intend to continue to pursue international contracts. International operations are subject to certain risks, such as: changes in domestic and foreign governmental regulations and licensing requirements; deterioration of relations between the U.S. and/or a particular foreign country; increases in tariffs and taxes and other trade barriers; foreign currency fluctuations; changes in political and economic stability both in the U.S. and internationally; effects of austerity programs or similar significant budget reduction programs; potential preferences by prospective customers to purchase from local (non-U.S.) sources; difficulties in obtaining or enforcing judgments in foreign jurisdictions; and unforeseen developments and conditions, including war, epidemics and pandemics and international tensions and conflicts. In addition, our international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific in-country purchases, investments, manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations, known as offset obligations, and provide for penalties if we fail to meet such requirements. The impact of these factors is difficult to predict, but one or more of them could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Exposure to United Kingdom political developments, including the effect of its withdrawal from the European Union, could be costly and difficult to comply with and could harm our business. Our United Kingdom operations service customers in the United Kingdom as well as in other countries in the European Union, and these operations continue to face risks and potential disruptions related to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. Although the United Kingdom and the European Union have entered into a trade and cooperation agreement, the long-term nature of the United Kingdom s relationship with the European Union remains unclear. For example, Brexit could lead to potentially divergent laws and regulations, such as with respect to data protection and data transfer laws, that could lead to uncertainty surrounding how data transfers will be regulated and could also be costly and difficult to comply with. While we continue to monitor these 
 45 

Table of Contents 
 developments, the full effect of Brexit on our operations is uncertain and our business could be harmed by trade disputes or political differences between the United Kingdom and the European Union in the future. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate headquarters are located at a leased facility in Westminster, Colorado. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately two million square feet of total leased floor space at multiple locations in the United States, Europe, the Middle East and Asia, used for manufacturing, warehousing, research and testing, administrative and various other uses. As of December 31, 2022, we had major operations in the following locations: Space Infrastructure Our Space Infrastructure segment primarily operates out of multiple locations in California. We lease approximately one million square feet of manufacturing and office space. Earth Intelligence Our Earth Intelligence segment primarily operates out of our U.S. locations in Colorado, Virginia, Michigan, Florida, and Missouri and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, our Sweden location and small sales offices located internationally. We lease approximately one million square feet of office and operations space.

 For additional information regarding the Merger, please refer to our Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on December 16, 2022. WorldView Legion satellites update Due to our pending Merger Agreement, we are no longer providing forward-looking updates on the timing of the launches of our WorldView Legion satellites. We are continuing integration testing for the WorldView Legion satellites, and launch of the satellites will occur following completion of that process. As previously disclosed in our public filings, and as more completely described in the Merger Agreement, no effect relating to or arising from the Company s WorldView Legion satellite program can constitute or contribute to a material adverse effect, and the Closing is not conditioned on the absence of any such effect or the success of the WorldView Legion program. JUPITER 3 satellite update On November 9, 2022, we notified EchoStar Corporation EchoStar ), that the expected shipment of the JUPITER 3 satellite JUPITER 3 had been delayed one month. Prior to the November 9, 2022 notification of the schedule change, the prior schedule communicated to EchoStar was an expected shipment date of March 26, 2023. JUPITER 3 was originally scheduled for shipment to EchoStar on January 19, 2021, under the terms of a 445 million contract between Maxar Space LLC and EchoStar, dated April 19, 2017 and amended October 1, 2018 (the Contract ). JUPITER 3 is an Ultra High-Density Satellite expected to be the world s largest commercial communications satellite when it launches, which contains significant technical innovations. As a result of the additional delay of approximately one month, EchoStar stated its intent to immediately terminate the Contract for default and claim a return of all monies paid to Maxar. To avoid this outcome, the two companies entered into an amendment to the Contract on November 16, 2022. Under the terms of the amendment, we have agreed to a 65 million reduction in the contract value which consists of (i) the forgiveness of all remaining milestone amounts owed by EchoStar to us related to JUPITER 3 of 14 million, (ii) the forgiveness of all orbital incentive payments of 43 million, which were payable by EchoStar with 6 interest over 15 years following launch and in-orbit service of JUPITER 3 and (iii) further reductions of 8 million. The orbital incentive payments were conditioned on the in-orbit performance of the satellite. In addition, we have agreed to enter into a commercial agreement whereby we will purchase certain goods and/or services from EchoStar in 2023 with the scope of such goods and/or services to be determined, but with a minimum value of 30 million. As we have not yet identified the scope of goods and/or services to be purchased under this agreement, we have reduced the contract value by 30 million. If at a later date the goods and/or services are identified the reduction to the contract value will be adjusted. We have also agreed to the payment of contingent additional liquidated damages if the delivery of JUPITER 3 extends beyond June 2023. The contingent additional liquidated damages are 8 million per month beginning in July 2023 and grow to 10 million per month beginning in October 2023 and thereafter. In return, EchoStar has agreed to eliminate its right to terminate the Contract for default for late delivery until January 1, 2024. We expect to deliver JUPITER 3 without incurring significant liquidated damages under the November 16, 2022, Contract amendment. We recognized a cumulative adjustment to revenue of 92 million and an increase in products costs of 3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 related to the JUPITER 3 amendment and commercial agreement with EchoStar. This resulted primarily from reducing the EAC transaction price for the amount of the remaining milestone and expected orbital payments from EchoStar due to the delay of the expected shipment of JUPITER 3. Additionally, as we have not yet identified the scope of goods and/or services to be purchased under the aforementioned commercial agreement, the total 95 million cumulative adjustment includes a 29 million adjustment to revenue and a 1 million adjustment to product costs related to these goods and/or services.

 Acquisition of Wovenware On November 1, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Wovenware Inc., Wovenware a privately held artificial intelligence and software development technology consulting firm, for total fair value consideration of 24 million, a portion of which is contingent on certain operating metrics, that will be paid out over a period of five years. As of November 1, 2022, Wovenware s results are consolidated and reported within the results of the Earth Intelligence segment. Electro-Optical Commercial Layer EOCL contract On May 25, 2022, the National Reconnaissance Office NRO awarded us a 10-year contract worth up to 3.24 billion, inclusive of a firm 5-year base contract commitment worth 1.5 billion and 1.74 billion in exercisable options, as part of the Electro-Optical Commercial Layer Program EOCL Contract ). The EOCL Contract transitioned the imagery acquisition requirements previously addressed by the EnhancedView Follow-On contract EnhancedView Contract and replaces the scope of the EnhancedView Contract with respect to such requirements. Under the EOCL Contract, we continue to provide high-resolution commercial satellite imagery services to the NRO for use across the U.S. defense and intelligence community. The EOCL Contract has an initial contract value of 1.5 billion with a 5-year base period of performance with the imagery acquisition portion beginning on June 15, 2022. This reflects a contractual commitment of just over 300 million for each of the first five years of the EOCL Contract to continue at a level comparable to services previously provided by us under the EnhancedView Contract. The 300 million base period commitment provides NRO access to the current constellation, then access, at an equivalent level, to the WorldView Legion satellites and the related imagery archive after satellites in our current constellation are no longer operational. The EOCL Contract, however, is flexible and allows for growth to consider additional capacity from the WorldView Legion satellites when they are operational. Accordingly, we retain growth capacity from our WorldView Legion satellites for the NRO and other customers. While the imagery acquisition portion of the EnhancedView Contract has moved to EOCL, we will continue to perform other awarded services on the EnhancedView Contract through 2025, concurrent with the new EOCL Contract. The opportunity to increase services beyond the awarded amount is also built into the EOCL Contract. The EOCL Contract differs significantly from the EnhancedView Contract in that it is a 5-year commitment with option years, instead of a one-year commitment with option years, and in addition, the EOCL Contract has built-in flexibility to increase services. For year five, the NRO has awarded an option for increased capabilities at a value of 40 million, bringing the potential value for year five to 340 million. For years six through ten, the NRO has awarded additional options with a potential annual value of up to 340 million. Sale of senior secured notes and repurchase of debt On June 14, 2022, we issued 500 million aggregate principal amount of 7.75 Senior Secured Notes due 2027 7.75 2027 Notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers in the U.S. pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act and outside the U.S. pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The 7.75 2027 Notes have an interest rate of 7.75 per annum and were issued at a price equal to 100 of their face value. The 7.75 2027 Notes will mature on June 15, 2027, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased. The 7.75 2027 Notes are secured on a first-priority basis by liens on our and the guarantor s assets that also secure, equally and ratably, our indebtedness under the Syndicated Credit Facility and the 7.54 2027 Notes (as such terms are defined below) pursuant to the terms of a first lien intercreditor agreement. The 7.75 2027 Notes are also guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of our subsidiaries that are guarantors under our Syndicated Credit Facility and our 7.54 2027 Notes. On June 14, 2022, we used proceeds from the 7.75 2027 Notes, along with cash on hand, to redeem the remaining 500 million aggregate principal amount of our 9.75 Senior Secured Notes due 2023 9.75 2023 Notes ). The

 9.75 2023 Notes were redeemed at a price of 107.313 of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued but unpaid interest. Concurrent amendment and restatement of Syndicated Credit Facility On June 14, 2022, we amended the terms of our senior secured Syndicated Credit Facility Syndicated Credit Facility pursuant to an amended and restated credit agreement Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ). The Syndicated Credit Facility is composed of the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan B (as such terms are each defined below). The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (i) replaced the Consolidated Leverage Ratio financial maintenance covenant with the Consolidated Net Debt Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) financial maintenance covenant not to exceed (1) 5.50:1.00 for each fiscal quarter ending on or prior to December 31, 2022, (2) 5.00:1.00 for each fiscal quarter ending on or after March 31, 2023 through and including December 31, 2023 and (3) 4.50:1.00 for each fiscal quarter ending on or after March 31, 2024, (ii) changed the required level of the Interest Coverage Ratio maintenance covenant to 2.50:1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, (iii) increased the total amount of the senior secured first lien term B facility Term Loan B outstanding to 1.5 billion and (iv) permitted the issuance of the 7.75 2027 Notes and the redemption of the 9.75 2023 Notes. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also extended the maturity date of the senior secured first lien revolving credit facility Revolving Credit Facility to June 14, 2027; provided that if the 7.75 2027 Notes are not repaid in full by the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the 7.75 2027 Notes Springing Maturity Date ), the maturity date for the Revolving Credit Facility will be the Springing Maturity Date, and extended the maturity date of Term Loan B to June 14, 2029; provided that if the 7.75 2027 Notes are not repaid in full by the Springing Maturity Date, the maturity date for the Term Loan B will be the maturity date of the 7.75 2027 Notes.

 Product and service revenues 

Year Ended December 31, Change Change Change Change 2022 2021 2020 2021 to 2022 2020 to 2021 millions) Product revenues 527 678 633 (151) (22) 45 7 Service revenues 1,078 1,092 1,090 (14) (1) 2 0 Total revenues 1,605 1,770 1,723 (165) (9) 47 3 Total revenues decreased to 1,605 million from 1,770 million, or by 165 million, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in product revenues in our Space Infrastructure segment driven by a 92 million cumulative adjustment to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 related to the JUPITER 3 amendment and commercial agreement with EchoStar that were entered into by the two companies in order to avoid EchoStar terminating the Contract for default. Total revenues increased to 1,770 million from 1,723 million, or by 47 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in revenues in our Space Infrastructure and Earth Intelligence segments. Further discussion of the drivers behind the change in revenues is included within the Results by Segment section below. See Note 15, Revenues to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for product and service revenues by segment.

The decrease in costs was primarily due to a decrease in product costs within our Space Infrastructure segment due to charges taken as a result of the non-performance of the SXM-7 satellite in the first quarter of 2021, which did not reoccur for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in product costs was also driven by the impact of reduced volumes as programs near the end of completion for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period of 2021. Total cost of product and services decreased to 984 million from 993 million, or by 9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease in costs was driven by a decrease in product costs within our Space Infrastructure segment partially offset by an increase in service costs within our Earth Intelligence segment.

Year Ended December 31, Change Change Change Change 2022 2021 2020 2021 to 2022 2020 to 2021 millions) Selling, general and administrative 431 369 332 62 17 37 11 Selling, general and administrative costs increased to 431 million from 369 million, or by 62 million, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period of 2021. The increase was primarily due to a 13 million increase in research and developments costs, an 11 million increase in expenses related to our enterprise resource planning ERP project, an 8 million increase in professional services expense, a 7 million increase in travel and facilities costs due to more employees working from our onsite location offices, a 6 million increase in information technology IT costs, a 6 million increase in transaction and integration related expenses and a 5 million increase in restructuring expenses. There was also a 10 million increase in labor related expenses and marketing and sales costs driven by increases in or reassignment of personnel, annual merit increases, increases in headcount and increases in fringe benefits for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period of 2021. Selling, general and administrative costs increased to 369 million from 332 million, or by 37 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in labor related expenses of 28 million, an increase in research and development expenses within the Space Infrastructure segment of 11 million and an increase in other expenses of 4 million. The increase in labor related expenses was primarily driven by an increase in headcount, employee compensation and fringe benefits. These increases were partially offset by a 6 million decrease in transaction and integration related expenses. Depreciation and amortization

The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in amortization expense related to intangible assets that were fully amortized in 2021 and 2022. There was also a decrease in depreciation expense of 9 million related to the extension of the useful lives of three satellites in the fourth quarter of 2021 and a decrease in depreciation expense of 2 million related to the extension of the useful lives of three satellites in the fourth quarter 2022. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to 290 million from 348 million, or by 58 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in amortization expense for backlog acquired as part of the acquisition of DigitalGlobe, Inc. on October 5, 2017. We recognized ten months of amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to none for the year ended December 31, 2021, as all of the U.S. government acquired backlog was fully amortized as of October 2020. The decrease was also driven by a decrease in depreciation expense related to the extension of the useful lives of two satellites in the fourth quarter of 2020 and three satellites in the fourth quarter of 2021. These decreases were partially offset by the inclusion of a full year of depreciation and amortization expense from property, plant and equipment and intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Vricon on July 1, 2020, compared to two quarters of expense in 2020.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, as a result of an increased certainty of collections of the outstanding orbital receivables from our largest customer following their emergence from bankruptcy, we recognized a 49 million reversal of our orbital receivables allowance. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a 14 million loss on our orbital receivables allowance within the Space Infrastructure segment. The loss was primarily due to a decrease in the credit rating associated with our largest orbital receivables customer. There were no changes in the allowance for expected credit losses related to our orbital receivables allowance for the year ended December 31, 2022. Impairment loss 

Year Ended December 31, Change Change Change Change 2022 2021 2020 2021 to 2022 2020 to 2021 millions) Impairment loss 33 (33) (100) Not meaningful. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized an impairment loss of 33 million related to the write-off of a 33 million prepaid asset with a commercial provider of ground station services under a contract which was above current market value. In December 2020, we executed a new multi-year contract with the provider for services at reduced cost. As a result of the prior contract being terminated and the new contract being at market value, we concluded the remaining prepaid asset from the prior contract with the provider had no continuing value. There were no impairment losses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. Interest expense, net

Interest expense, net increased to 158 million from 151 million, or by 7 million, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The increase was primarily due to a 12 million increase in loss on debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period of 2021 driven by a 53 million loss on debt extinguishment incurred in connection with the redemption of our 9.75 2023 Notes (as defined below) and the amendment of our Term Loan B (as defined below) and Revolving Credit Facility in the second quarter of 2022, compared to a 41 million loss on debt extinguishment recognized from the partial redemption of our 9.75 2023 Notes in the first quarter of 2021. The increase was also due to an increase in interest on long-term debt of 12 million driven by an increase in interest rates on our Term Loan B (as defined below) which was amended in the second quarter of

 2022. These increases were partially offset by a 15 million increase in capitalized interest related to the building of our WorldView Legion satellites. Interest expense, net decreased to 151 million from 175 million, or by 24 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a 47 million decrease in interest on long-term debt primarily driven by lower principal balances on the 2023 Notes and Term Loan B (as defined below) due to a repurchase of a portion of the 2023 Notes in the second quarter of 2020, a partial redemption of the 2023 Notes in the first quarter of 2021 and a repayment made on Term Loan B in the second quarter of 2020. These decreases in interest on long-term debt were partially offset by an increase in interest expense following our issuance of the 2027 Notes (as defined below). There was also an increase in capitalized interest of 7 million related to the building of our WorldView Legion satellites . These decreases were partially offset by a 41 million loss on debt extinguishment from the partial redemption of our 2023 Notes using proceeds from the Offering for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a 7 million loss on debt extinguishment for 2020.

The change was primarily due to a 12 million expense related to the satisfaction of an offset obligation incurred as a result of conducting business in a foreign country, which was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to no expense in 2021. The increase in expense was partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense of the net loss on our pension plans for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period of 2021. Other income, net decreased to 8 million from 104 million, or by 96 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a gain of 85 million recorded as a result of the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in Vricon due to the acquisition of Vricon for the year ended December 31, 2020 which did not recur in 2021. In addition, the decrease was driven by a 3 million foreign exchange loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a 5 million foreign exchange gain for the year ended December 31, 2020.

 Income tax benefit decreased to 13 million from 22 million, or by 9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020. This change was primarily due to a 13 million reduction in the December 31, 2020 estimated federal BEAT driven by a change in tax strategy enabled by a reduction in forecasted interest expense.

There was no income from discontinued operations, net of tax for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, as the sale of our former Canadian subsidiary MDA Business to Neptune Acquisition, Inc. was completed in the second quarter of 2020. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax was 349 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 driven by the after-tax gain on disposal of the MDA Business of 317 million and a 39 million recovery of a previously recorded liability in relation to the Company s dispute with a Ukrainian customer.

 Earth Intelligence The following table provides selected financial information for the Earth Intelligence segment. 

Year Ended December 31, Change Change Change Change 2022 2021 2020 2021 to 2022 2020 to 2021 millions) Total revenues 1,078 1,093 1,081 (15) (1) 12 1 Adjusted EBITDA 445 492 513 (47) (10) (21) (4) Adjusted EBITDA margin (as a of total revenues) 41.3 45.0 47.5 Revenues from the Earth Intelligence segment decreased to 1,078 million from 1,093 million, or by 15 million, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a 19 million decrease in revenues from commercial programs driven by a one-time license uplift on a commercial contract in 2021. The decrease was also driven by a 17 million decrease in revenues from international defense and intelligence customers primarily due to less orders on archive and 3D imagery. Additionally, certain transactions that were expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022 did not occur in the period. These decreases were partially offset by a 21 million increase in revenues from the U.S. government. The increase in revenues from the U.S. government was primarily due to a 56 million increase in imagery solutions revenues, including revenues from crisis support services, partially offset by a 35 million decrease in geospatial service revenues from U.S. government customers. Revenues from the Earth Intelligence segment increased to 1,093 million from 1,081 million, or by 12 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily driven by a 48 million increase in revenue from international defense and intelligence customers, a 36 million increase in new and expanded commercial programs and a 7 million increase in revenue from new contracts with the U.S. government. These increases were partially offset by an 80 million decrease in the recognition of deferred revenue related to the EnhancedView Contract. We recognized 80 million of deferred revenue from the EnhancedView Contract for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to none for the year ended December 31, 2021, as it was fully recognized as of August 31, 2020. Adjusted EBITDA decreased to 445 million from 492 million, or by 47 million, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period of 2021. The decrease was primarily related to the above-mentioned decrease in revenues and a 23 million increase in selling, general and administrative costs, compared to the same period of 2021. The increase in selling, general and administrative costs was primarily driven by increased spending, including professional services expense of 7 million, an increase in travel costs and facilities costs of 6 million due to more employees working from our onsite location offices, IT costs of 5 million and our ERP project of 4 million. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was also due to an increase in service costs driven by increases in headcount, annual merit increases and increases in fringe benefits for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA decreased to 492 million from 513 million, or by 21 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in the recognition of deferred revenue related to the EnhancedView Contract as mentioned above. The decrease was also driven by an increase in selling, general and administrative costs due to an increase in labor related expenses driven by an increase in headcount, employee compensation and fringe benefits for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020. These decreases were partially offset by the expansion of contracts with existing commercial and international defense and intelligence customers contributing to positive program margin growth.

 Space Infrastructure The following table provides selected financial information for the Space Infrastructure segment. 

Year Ended December 31, Change Change Change Change 2022 2021 2020 2021 to 2022 2020 to 2021 millions) Total revenues 626 740 721 (114) (15) 19 3 Adjusted EBITDA (32) 46 (3) (78) (170) 49 Adjusted EBITDA margin (as a of total revenues) (5.1) 6.2 (0.4) Not meaningful. Changes in revenues from year to year are influenced by the size, timing and number of satellite contracts awarded in the current and preceding years and the length of the construction period for satellite contracts awarded. Revenues on satellite contracts are recognized using the cost-to-cost method to determine the percentage of completion over the construction period, which typically ranges between 20 to 36 months, and up to 48 months in certain situations. Adjusted EBITDA margins can vary from quarter to quarter due to the mix of our revenues and changes in our estimated total costs at completion EAC as our risks are retired and as our EACs are increased or decreased based on contract performance. Adjusted EBITDA margins are also impacted by estimated contractual consideration. Revenues from the Space Infrastructure segment decreased to 626 million from 740 million, or by 114 million, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period of 2021. Revenues decreased primarily due to a 92 million cumulative adjustment to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 related to the JUPITER 3 amendment and commercial agreement with EchoStar. This resulted primarily from adjusting the EAC transaction price for the amount of the remaining milestone and expected orbital payments from EchoStar due to the delay of the expected shipment of JUPITER 3 and an adjustment related to the commercial agreement as we have not yet identified the scope of goods and/or services to be purchased. There was also a decrease in revenues from commercial programs of 50 million driven by the impact of reduced volumes as programs near the end of completion, including C-Band contracts, for the year-ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period of 2021. The decrease in revenues was also driven by a 5 million decrease in revenues from U.S. government contracts during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period of 2021. These decreases were partially offset by a 33 million aggregate impact due to the non-performance of the SXM-7 satellite that was recorded during 2021, which did not reoccur for the year ended December 31, 2022. Revenues from the Space Infrastructure segment increased to 740 million from 721 million, or by 19 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020. Revenues increased primarily as a result of an increase in revenues from commercial programs of 87 million due to higher volumes and lower EAC growth primarily due to no COVID-19 program impacts for the year ended December 31, 2021. Revenues were negatively impacted by a 19 million decrease year over year related to our contract with Sirius XM Holdings Inc. Sirius XM ). The year ended December 31, 2021, included a 30 million cumulative adjustment to revenue primarily related to the loss of final milestone and expected orbital payments from Sirius XM due to the non-performance of the SXM-7 satellite and other adjustments that were recorded in 2021. After exhausting efforts to fully recover the SXM-7 satellite and further discussions with Sirius XM, in April 2021, we made the determination to record the cumulative adjustment to revenue. In addition, there were 3 million of costs incurred in the first quarter of 2021 related to attempts to repair and fully recover the SXM-7 satellite. The aggregate impact for the year ended December 31, 2021, was 33 million. The 33 million decrease was partially offset by the non-reoccurrence of a 14 million adjustment to revenue due to the identification of a design anomaly on the commercial satellite program, which was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, the total increase in revenues from the Space Infrastructure segment was partially offset by a 49 million decrease in revenues from U.S. government contracts. Adjusted EBITDA decreased to a loss of 32 million from 46 million, or by 78 million, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by the 95 million reduction in revenue and increase in

 product costs related to the above-mentioned JUPITER 3 impacts. The decrease was also driven by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of 26 million including marketing expenses and labor related expenses of 11 million from increases in headcount and annual merit increases, research and development expense of 8 million, our ERP project of 5 million and a 2 million increase in other expense. There was also a decrease in product margins driven by the impact of the above-mentioned reduced volumes on commercial programs for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period of 2021. These decreases in Adjusted EBITDA were partially offset by the above-mentioned SXM-7 satellite impacts which did not reoccur in the same period in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA increased to 46 million from a loss of 3 million, or by 49 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020. The increase in the Space Infrastructure segment was primarily related to a 92 million increase driven by increased volumes on commercial programs which resulted in increased margins and fewer negative EAC impacts during the year as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, which included negative EAC impacts due to COVID-19. The increase in commercial program margins has been driven by a change in program mix related to the completion of less profitable programs offset by new, more profitable programs. These increases were partially offset by the 19 million reduction in revenue related to the above-mentioned SXM-7 satellite impacts and a 19 million increase in indirect costs and selling, general and administrative costs which was primarily driven by an 11 million increase in research and development expenses. Corporate and other expenses Corporate and other expenses include items such as corporate office costs, regulatory costs, executive and director compensation, foreign exchange gains and losses, retention costs and fees for legal and consulting services. Corporate and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 remained relatively unchanged year over year as they increased to 91 million from 89 million, or by 2 million, compared to 2021. Corporate and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased to 89 million from 61 million, or by 28 million, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily driven by a 14 million increase in selling, general and administrative costs primarily due to an increase in labor related expenses driven by an increase in employee compensation and fringe benefits. There was also an increase in stock-based compensation expense of 5 million primarily due to a higher fair market value of equity awards granted. The increase was also driven by a 3 million foreign exchange loss for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a 5 million foreign exchange gain for the year ended December 31, 2020. Intersegment eliminations Intersegment eliminations are related to projects between our segments, including the construction of our WorldView Legion satellites. Intersegment eliminations increased to 36 million from 25 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021, primarily related to an increase in satellite construction activity. Intersegment eliminations decreased to 25 million from 27 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020, primarily related to a decrease in satellite construction activity.

 BACKLOG Our backlog by segment is as follows: 

December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 millions) Earth Intelligence 2,048 1,028 Space Infrastructure 1,146 865 Total backlog 3,194 1,893 Unfunded contract options 2,089 650 Total 5,283 2,543 Order backlog, representing the estimated dollar value of firm contracts for which work has not yet been performed (also known as the remaining performance obligations on a contract), was 3,194 million as of December 31, 2022 compared to 1,893 million as of December 31, 2021. The increase in backlog was driven by an increase in the Earth Intelligence segment due to the EOCL contract and an increase in the Space Infrastructure segment primarily due to new contracts with commercial customers. Order backlog generally does not include unexercised contract options and potential orders under indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts. Approximately 39 of the total 3,194 million backlog as of December 31, 2022 is expected to be converted into revenue in 2023. Backlog in the Space Infrastructure segment is primarily comprised of multi-year awards, such as satellite builds. Fluctuations in backlog are driven primarily by the timing of large program wins. Backlog in the Earth Intelligence segment consists of both multi-year and annual contracts, which renew at various times throughout the year. As a result, the timing of when contracts are awarded and when option years are exercised may cause backlog to fluctuate significantly from period to period. Although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm, terminations, amendments or cancellations may occur, which could result in a reduction in our total backlog. Our unfunded contract options totaled 2,089 million and 650 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Unfunded contract options represent estimated amounts of revenue to be earned in the future from negotiated contracts with unexercised contract options and indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts. Unfunded contract options as of December 31, 2022 were primarily comprised of option years in the EOCL Contract (for the periods June 15, 2027 through June 14, 2032) and other U.S. government contracts. Unfunded contract options as of December 31, 2021 were primarily comprised of the option year in the EnhancedView Contract (September 1, 2022 through July 12, 2023) and other U.S. government contracts. On May 25, 2022, we were awarded the EOCL Contract by the NRO, which is a 10-year contract worth up to 3.24 billion, inclusive of a firm 5-year base contract commitment worth 1.5 billion and 1.74 billion in exercisable options. The EOCL Contract transitioned the imagery acquisition requirement previously addressed by the EnhancedView Contract and, with this award, replaces the scope of the EnhancedView, with respect to such requirements. LIQUIDITY CAPITAL RESOURCES Our sources of liquidity include cash provided by operations, access to existing credit facilities, collection or securitization of orbital receivables and, when available and efficient, access to the capital markets. We generally maintain limited cash on hand and use available cash to pay down borrowings on our Syndicated Credit Facility (as defined below). Our primary short-term cash requirements are to fund working capital, including requirements on long-term construction contracts (including our geostationary satellite contracts), fixed overhead costs and to fund the construction and launch of our WorldView Legion satellites and other capital expenditures. Working capital requirements can vary significantly from period to period, particularly as a result of the timing of receipts and disbursements related to long-term construction contracts. Our medium-term to long-term cash requirements are to service and repay debt and make investments, including in facilities, equipment, technologies and research and development for growth initiatives. These capital investments include investments to replace the capability or capacity of satellites which have or will go out of service in the future.

 Over the near-term to medium-term, it is also possible that our customers may fully or partially fund the construction of additional Legion satellites. Cash is also used to pay dividends and finance other long-term strategic business initiatives. In June 2022, we issued 500 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.75 2027 Notes and used the proceeds, along with cash on hand, to redeem in full the remaining 500 million aggregate principal amount of our 9.75 2023 Notes. Also in June 2022, we amended our Syndicated Credit Facility to increase the total amount of Term Loan B outstanding to 1.5 billion and extended the maturity date of our Revolving Credit Facility to June 14, 2027. See Recent Developments above for additional information. As a result, our first maturity of long-term debt is in June of 2027 and relates to our Revolving Credit Facility and 7.75 2027 Notes. Our 7.54 2027 Notes (as defined below) will mature in December of 2027. We have significant purchase obligations in the normal course of business for goods and services, under agreements with defined terms as to quantity, price and timing of delivery. Purchase obligations represent open purchase orders and other commitments for the purchase or construction of property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, operational commitments related to remote ground terminals, or with subcontractors on long-term construction contracts that we have with customers in the normal course of business. As of the year ended December 31, 2022, we had total short-term purchase obligations of 491 million and total long-term purchase obligations of 223 million. These amounts are based on volumes consistent with anticipated requirements to fulfill purchase orders or contracts for product deliveries received, or expected to be received, from customers. We also have short and long-term requirements to fund our pension plans within the Space Infrastructure segment. Funding requirements under applicable laws and regulations are a major consideration in making contributions to our pension plans. Failure to satisfy the minimum funding thresholds with respect to appropriate laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to amend the plans or make benefit payments. With respect to our qualified pension plan, we intend to contribute annually not less than the required minimum funding thresholds. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 includes provisions for pension funding relief in future periods. We have elected to take advantage of these provisions and anticipate lower required contributions for our qualified pension plan in the upcoming years. We had no further required cont ributions on our qualified pension plan for the year ended December 31, 2022. There are no required contributions for our qualified pension plan for the year ending December 31, 2023. Our ability to fund our cash needs will depend, in part, on our ability to generate cash in the future, which depends on our future financial results. Our future results are subject to general economic factors, including inflation and rising interest rate costs, and financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors that may be outside of our control. Our future access to, and the availability of credit on acceptable terms and conditions is impacted by many factors, including capital market liquidity and overall economic conditions. We believe that our cash from operating activities generated from continuing operations, together with available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, will be adequate for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future to meet our anticipated uses of cash flow, including working capital, capital expenditure, debt service costs, dividend and other commitments. While we intend to reduce debt over time using cash provided by operations, we may also seek to meet long-term debt obligations, if necessary, and fund future capital investments by obtaining capital from a variety of additional sources or by refinancing existing obligations. These sources include public or private capital markets, bank financings, proceeds from dispositions or other third-party sources.

Investment in working capital is also necessary to build our business and manage lead times in construction activities. We expect working capital account balances to continue to vary from period to period. We efficiently fund our working capital requirements with the Revolving Credit Facility. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to 325 million from 294 million, or by 31 million, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. This change was primarily driven by favorable changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to 294 million from 243 million, or by 51 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020.

 Financing activities Cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations increased to 7 million compared to cash used by financing activities of 31 million, or by 38 million, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period of 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Term Loan B was refinanced, which resulted in net proceeds of 1,329 million offset by the cash paid to extinguish the prior Term Loan B of 1,341 million, which excluded amounts accounted for as a debt modification. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2022, cash used in financing activities included 537 million used to redeem our 9.75 2023 Notes, including approximately 37 million in premiums paid to redeem such 9.75 2023 Notes, debt issuance costs of 27 million, repayments of long-term debt of 18 million and settlement of the securitization liability of 14 million. These items were offset by 500 million in proceeds from the issuance of our 7.75 2027 Notes and 125 million from the net proceeds of the Revolving Credit Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2021, cash used in financing activities from continuing operations included a repurchase of the 2023 Notes of 384 million, settlement of a securitization liability of 13 million and debt repayments of 10 million, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock of 380 million.

 9.75 Notes due 2023 On December 11, 2019, we issued 1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 9.75 2023 Notes in a private placement to institutional buyers. The 9.75 2023 Notes were issued at a price of 98 and are recorded as long-term debt in our consolidated financial statements. The 9.75 2023 Notes bore interest at the rate of 9.75 per year, payable semi-annually in cash in arrears, for which interest payments commenced in June 2020. On June 14, 2022, we used the proceeds from the issuance of the 7.75 2027 Notes, along with cash on hand, to redeem the remaining 500 million aggregate principal amount of our 9.75 2023 Notes. The 9.75 2023 Notes were redeemed at a price of 107.313 of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued but unpaid interest. 7.75 Notes due 2027 On June 14, 2022, we issued 500 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.75 2027 Notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers. The 7.75 2027 Notes were issued at a price equal to 100 of their face value and are recorded as long-term debt in the consolidated financial statements. The 7.75 2027 Notes bear interest at the rate of 7.75 per year, payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2022. The 7.75 2027 Notes will mature on June 15, 2027, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased. The 7.75 2027 Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of our subsidiaries that are guarantors under the Syndicated Credit Facility and its 7.54 2027 Notes (as defined below). 7.54 Notes due 2027 On June 25, 2020, we issued 150 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.54 Senior Secured Notes due 2027 7.54 2027 Notes in a private placement to institutional buyers. The 7.54 2027 Notes were issued at a price of 98.25 and are recorded as long-term debt in our consolidated financial statements. The 7.54 2027 Notes bear interest at the rate of 7.54 per year, payable semi-annually in cash in arrears, for which interest payments commenced in December 2020. The 7.54 2027 Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of our existing and future subsidiaries that guarantee the Syndicated Credit Facility and the 9.75 2023 Notes. Leaseback Deferred Financing On December 10, 2019, we completed the sale and subsequent leaseback of our owned properties in Palo Alto, California for proceeds of 291 million. We determined that the leaseback terms were off-market. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 842 Leases, we accounted for the excess of the leaseback payments over the present value of market rental payments as additional financing, separate from the lease liability. This resulted in recognition of a deferred financing liability of 33 million which is repayable over the 10-year leaseback term. See Note 11, Long-term debt and interest expense, net to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further details on our long-term debt. Securitization liability We have in place a revolving securitization facility agreement with an international financial institution. Under the terms of the Syndicated Credit Facility, we may offer to sell eligible orbital receivables from time to time with terms of seven years or less, discounted to face value using prevailing market rates. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we did not sell or repurchase any orbital receivables. The orbital receivables that were securitized remain on our balance sheet as the accounting criteria for surrendering control of the orbital receivables were not met. The net proceeds received have been recognized as a securitization liability that has been subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. The securitized orbital receivables and the securitization liabilities are being drawn down as payments are received from customers and passed on to the international financial institution. We continue to recognize orbital revenue on the orbital receivables that are subject to the securitization transactions and recognize interest expense to accrete the securitization liability.

 Off-balance sheet arrangements As of December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding foreign exchange sales contracts. As of December 31, 2022, we had 24 million in letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility. Such arrangements are not expected to have a material effect on our liquidity or capital resources, financial position or results of operations. We use, from time to time, derivative financial instruments to manage existing foreign currency exposures. We consider the management of financial risks to be an important part of our overall corporate risk management policy. Foreign exchange forward contracts are used to hedge our exposure to currency risk on sales, purchases, cash, net investments and loans denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of our domestic and foreign operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2, Summary of significant accounting policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . We consider the following accounting policies to be critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because these policies require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue recognition The recognition and measurement of revenue requires the use of judgments and estimates. Specifically, judgment is used in interpreting complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions and determining when all criteria for revenue recognition have been met. Space Infrastructure Revenue in the Space Infrastructure segment is primarily generated from long-term construction contracts. Due to the long-term nature of these contracts, we generally recognize revenue over time using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress. Under the cost-to-cost method, revenue is recognized based on the proportion of total costs incurred to EAC. Revenue recognition is also contingent on estimated contractual consideration. An EAC includes all direct costs and indirect costs directly attributable to a program or allocable based on program cost pooling arrangements. Estimates regarding the Company s cost associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of products and services are used in determining the EAC. Changes to EAC cost or estimated contractual consideration are recorded as a cumulative catch-up adjustment. Our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge of our engineering, program management and financial professionals and draws on their significant experience and judgment. We prepare EACs for our contracts and calculate estimated revenues and costs over the life of our contracts. Variable consideration is included in our estimates to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. We estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. Since our contracts typically span a period of several years, estimation of revenue, cost and progress toward completion requires the use of judgment. Judgments and estimates are re-assessed at least quarterly with most estimates being updated on a monthly basis. Adjustments in estimates could have a material impact on revenue recognition based on the significance of the adjustments. Factors considered in these estimates include our historical performance, the availability, productivity and cost of labor, the nature and complexity of work to be performed, availability and cost of materials, components and subcontracts, the risk and impact of delayed performance and the level of indirect cost allocations.

 Earth Intelligence Revenue in the Earth Intelligence segment is generated from imagery and geospatial intelligence service contracts. Revenue from imagery service contracts is recognized based on satellite capacity made available to the customer in a particular period, when imagery is delivered to the customer, or ratably over the subscription period. Many of our imagery service contracts relate to the transfer of a series of distinct goods or services over time for which management has determined are a single performance obligation. Revenue from our geospatial intelligence service contracts is recognized from the rendering of services that compensate us at a cost-plus-fixed-fee, firm fixed price, or on a time and materials basis. Some of our contracts contain multiple performance obligations, which requires us to estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation in order to allocate consideration transferred from the customer. We have not historically been able to use third-party evidence for determining standalone selling price due to the unique nature of our products and services and lack of visibility into competitor pricing. Standalone selling prices are determined based on management estimates that involve significant judgment. Multiple factors are considered based on the nature of the deliverables included within the contract, which include market conditions, competitive landscape, geographic or regional specific factors, internal costs, profit margin objectives and pricing practices used by us. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States, Sweden and other foreign jurisdictions. We compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply in years in which they are expected to be paid for or realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Significant judgments are required in order to determine the realizability of tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence, including historical operating results, estimates of future sources of taxable income, carry-forward periods available, the existence of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and other relevant factors. For further information regarding our deferred tax assets and liabilities see Note 2, Summary of significant accounting policies and Note 20, Income taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES In addition to results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental indicators of our financial and operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures include EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin. We define EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for certain items affecting the comparability of our ongoing operating results as specified in the calculation and Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Certain items affecting the comparability of our ongoing operating results between periods include restructuring, impairments, insurance recoveries, gain (loss) on sale of assets, (gain) loss on orbital receivables allowance, offset obligation fulfillment, amortization of deferred ERP implementation costs and transaction and integration related expense. Transaction and integration related expense includes costs associated with de-leveraging activities, acquisitions and dispositions and the integration of acquisitions. Management believes that exclusion of these items assists in providing a more complete understanding of our underlying 
 66 

Table of Contents 
 results and trends, and management uses these measures along with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures to manage our business, evaluate our performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace, and to establish operational goals. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure being used as a key element of our incentive compensation plan. The Syndicated Credit Facility also uses Adjusted EBITDA in the determination of our debt leverage covenant ratio. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA in the Syndicated Credit Facility includes a more comprehensive set of adjustments that may result in a different calculation therein. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results, provide useful information to investors by facilitating the comparability of our ongoing operating results over the periods presented, the ability to identify trends in our underlying business, and the comparison of our operating results against analyst financial models and operating results of other public companies. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not recognized terms under U.S. GAAP and may not be defined similarly by other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net income as indications of financial performance or as alternate to cash flows from operations as measures of liquidity. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under U.S. GAAP. The table below reconciles our net (loss) income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk on our variable-rate borrowings under our Syndicated Credit Facility, which is comprised of the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan B. We use interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of interest rate risk associated with cash outflows from long-term debt. There was 1.5 billion and 1.4 billion outstanding under our Term Loan B as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Term Loan B bears interest equal to, at our option, either (i) Adjusted Term SOFR plus an applicable margin ranging from 4.00 to 4.25 , or (ii) adjusted base rate ABR ), plus an applicable margin ranging from 3.00 to 3.25 , in each case depending on the total Consolidated Net Debt Leverage Ratio. As of December 31, 2022, there was 125 million outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at a rate equal to, at our option, if such borrowings are in U.S. dollars, either (i) Adjusted Term SOFR plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.75 to 3.50 , or (ii) ABR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.75 to 2.50 , in each case depending on the total Consolidated Net Debt Leverage Ratio. We may also, at our option, borrow in Canadian dollars, Euros or British Pounds Sterling using the same applicable margins as noted for U.S. dollars. On April 29, 2022, 500 million of our interest rate swaps matured. On June 22, 2022, we entered into SOFR interest rate swaps having a notional value of 500 million. In June 2022, we amended our existing interest rate swaps that mature in June 2023 to modify the designated hedge interest rate risk from LIBOR to SOFR in connection with our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. In total, as of December 31, 2022, an aggregate of 1 billion of our variable rate long-term debt is fixed at an average one-month SOFR rate of 1.71 (excluding the margin specified in the Syndicated Credit Facility) pursuant to our outstanding interest rate swaps. In each of June 2023 and June 2024, we will have interest rate swap maturities of 500 million. Based upon the amounts outstanding under the Syndicated Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022, net of the interest rate swaps and assuming the amounts were outstanding for a full calendar year, a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would increase interest expense under the Syndicated Credit Facility by approximately 3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 prior to our entry into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. We may decide in future periods to engage in hedging transactions to further mitigate the interest rate risk under our Syndicated Credit Facility. Foreign Currency Risk Although the majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars, some of our transactions are denominated in foreign currencies. Certain contractual relationships with customers and vendors mitigate risks from currency exchange rate changes that arise from normal purchasing and normal sales activities. Our revenue and purchase contracts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies may make payments in U.S. dollars, as provided for under our existing contracts, more difficult for foreign customers. In addition, fluctuations in foreign currencies could introduce volatility into our financial statements for contracts denominated in a foreign currency.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and Board of Directors Maxar Technologies Inc.: Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Maxar Technologies Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, cash flows, and changes in stockholders equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 22, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for contract modifications and hedge accounting as of June 30, 2022 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848). Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical

 audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Revenue recognition for certain long-term fixed-price contracts in the Space Infrastructure segment As discussed in Notes 2 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue over time using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress. Under the cost-to-cost method, revenue is recognized based on the proportion of total costs incurred to estimated total costs-at-completion (EAC). An EAC includes all direct costs and indirect costs attributable to a program or allocable costs based on program cost pooling arrangements. Estimates regarding the Company s costs associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of products and services are used in determining the EAC. Changes to an EAC are recorded as a cumulative adjustment to revenue. We identified the evaluation of revenue recognition for certain long-term fixed-price contracts in the Space Infrastructure segment as a critical audit matter. In particular, evaluating the Company s estimated costs to complete required a high degree of subjective auditor judgment given the nature and complexity of the work to be performed. The determination of, and changes to, those estimates may have a significant impact on revenue recorded. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company s process to estimate costs to complete for fixed-price, long-term contracts. For certain contracts, we compared the Company s original or prior period estimate of total contract costs to be incurred to changes in total actual and estimated future contract costs to be incurred to assess the Company s ability to estimate costs. We inquired of financial and operational personnel of the Company and inspected supporting documents to identify factors that should be considered within the cost to complete estimates for indications of possible management bias. We evaluated the Company s estimated costs to complete by: reading the underlying contracts and related amendments to obtain an understanding of the contractual requirements and related performance obligations considering costs incurred to-date and the relative progress towards completion of the contracts considering, if relevant, the estimated costs to complete on similar or historical contracts considering, if relevant, the estimated reserves on specific contracts that include estimation uncertainty based on the nature of the contract inspecting correspondence, if any, between the Company and the customer regarding actual costs to date and expected performance remaining evaluating the Company s assessment of contract performance risks included within the estimated costs to complete.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and Board of Directors Maxar Technologies Inc.: Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Maxar Technologies Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income, cash flows, and changes in stockholders equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 22, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become

 million and million, respectively, and are included in Other non-current assets within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Space Infrastructure Revenue in the Space Infrastructure segment is primarily generated from long-term construction contracts. Due to the long-term nature of these contracts, the Company generally recognizes revenue over time using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress. Under the cost-to-cost method, revenue is recognized based on the proportion of total costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion EAC ). Revenue recognition is also contingent on estimated contractual consideration. Variable consideration is included in the Company s estimates to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The Company estimates variable consideration as the most likely amount to which it expects to be entitled. An EAC includes all direct costs and indirect costs directly attributable to a program or allocable based on program cost pooling arrangements. Estimates regarding the Company s cost associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of products and services are used in determining the EAC. Changes to EAC cost or estimated contractual consideration are recorded as a cumulative catch-up adjustment. Satellite construction contracts may include performance incentives whereby payment for a portion of the purchase price is contingent upon in-orbit performance of the satellite. These performance incentives are structured in two forms. As a warranty payback, the customer pays the entire amount of the performance incentive during the period of the satellite construction and such incentives are subject to refund if satellite performance does not achieve certain predefined operating specifications. As an orbital receivable, the customer makes payment of performance incentives over the in-orbit life of the satellite. Performance incentives, whether warranty payback or orbital receivables, are included in revenue during the construction period to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. A portion of performance incentives may be allocated to services in the post-launch period if a separate performance obligation for such services has been determined to exist within the contract. In addition to the in-orbit performance incentives, satellite construction contracts may include liquidated damages clauses. Liquidated damages can be incurred on programs as a result of delays due to slippage or for programs which fail to meet all milestone requirements as outlined within the contractual arrangements with customers. Losses related to liquidated damages result in a reduction of revenue recognized and are recorded in the period in which, based on available facts and circumstances, management believes it is probable that liquidated damages will be incurred and enforced. Construction contracts have termination clauses. If a contract is terminated for convenience by a customer, the Company is typically entitled to costs incurred plus a reasonable profit. Earth Intelligence Revenue in the Earth Intelligence segment is generated from imagery and geospatial intelligence service contracts. Revenue from imagery service contracts is recognized based on satellite capacity made available to the customer in a particular period, when imagery is delivered to the customer, or ratably over the subscription period. Many of our imagery service contracts relate to the transfer of a series of distinct goods or services over time for which management has determined are a single performance obligation. Electro-Optical Commercial Layer Program On May 25, 2022, the Company was awarded the Electro-Optical Commercial Layer contract EOCL Contract by the National Reconnaissance Office NRO ). The EOCL Contract transitioned the capacity requirements, previously addressed by the EnhancedView Contract and, with this award, replaces the scope of the EnhancedView Contract with respect to such requirements. The EOCL Contract includes performance obligation to deliver a certain amount of capacity to the U.S. government over a 5-year base contractual term beginning on June 15, 2022 and up to five 1-year option periods.

Maxar Technologies Inc., et al. , No. 19CV35070 in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara, naming Maxar and certain members of management and the Board of Directors as defendants.
