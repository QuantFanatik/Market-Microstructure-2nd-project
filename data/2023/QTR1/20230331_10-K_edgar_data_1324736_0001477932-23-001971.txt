BUSINESS Overview The Company's business model includes licensing operations, processing operations, processing facilities, sale of products, brand creation, technology development, and consulting services relating to the marijuana industry. Ultimately, our intent is to become a low-cost branded cannabis company. We were originally incorporated as Dujour Products, Inc. on May 15, 2004, in the State of Nevada. Most recently we operated under the name Holloman Energy Corporation. On May 1, 2020, we sold 1,000,000 shares of its Series A preferred stock to Magenta Value Holdings LLC. The Series A preferred shares have the right to cast 90 of the total votes with respect to any and all matters presented to the stockholders of the Company for their action or consideration. After Magenta Value Holdings LLC acquired its preferred shares of the Company, Gina Serkasevich, the CFO of Holloman Energy Corporation was appointed to CEO, Treasurer, and Director. Subsequently, the Company adopted amended and restated articles of incorporation, thereby changing its name to Hero Technologies Inc. In a related transaction, Holloman Value Holdings sold approximately 2,245,000 of debt owed to it by the Company to P2B Capital LLC. On November 6, 2020, the Company acquired highlyrelaxing.com and subsequently formed Highly Relaxing LLC, an emerging Cannabidiol CBD therapeutic company located in Denver, CO that provides topical agents and other creams and products. As of December 31, 2022 Highly Relaxing has not generated revenue for the Company. On September 10, 2020, the Company formed Blackbox Technologies and Systems LLC. Blackbox Technologies and Systems LLC has been renamed Blackbox Systems and Technologies LLC. Blackbox has applied to the state of Michigan for marijuana licenses, and received step 1 approvals in adult-use and medicinal use. Full licenses if granted, will allow Blackbox to cultivate cannabis in the state of Michigan. If the licenses are granted, Blackbox plans to construct four greenhouses and ----four hoop houses at a cost of approximately 9 million. The greenhouses will grow large cannabis flowering plants based on aeroponic technology. Aeroponics is the process of growing plants in an air or mist environment without the use of soil or an aggregate medium. The Company has a 51 interest in Blackbox. Although the total cost of the project is estimated at 9 million, there are alternative options that will allow the Company to proceed with the project at a lower cost. For example, the lowest cost option, the hoop houses, require a total cost of only 501,196. Below is a table depicting the various options and the estimated number of shares that need to be sold in our public offering to fund each option: Name of the Option: Total Cost: Projected Revenue (assuming 3,200/lbs.): Number of shares that must be sold to fund the project: Hoop houses 501,196 2lb/plant: 1,536,000 6lb/plant: 4,608,000 31,023,920 GrowSpan Greenhouses 740,000 1lb/plant: 3,456,000 2lb/plant: 6,912,000 4lb/plant: 13,824,000 35,800,000 Ceres (1 SunChamber with Headhouse) 2,270,000 1lb/plant: 4,608,000 2lb/plant: 9,216,000 4lb/plant: 18,432,000 80,000,000 4 Table of Contents Blackbox is currently seeking two Michigan marijuana licenses, one for adult use and one for medicinal use. Specifically, Blackbox is in the process of pursuing a Class C license, which would permit them to cultivate up to 2,000 marijuana plants for adult use and 1,500 plants for medicinal use. In order to obtain such a license, Blackbox is required to pay an initial fee of 40,000 for each license. Further, Blackbox is required to pay a renewal fee for every year that they wish to retain their license. The fee for renewing a marijuana license can range from 30,000 to 50,000, depending on the total weight of the marijuana plants that were cultivated for the preceding year. At present, Blackbox has satisfied the criteria for Step 1 Prequalification approval for a Class C medicinal-use cannabis license in Michigan. Similarly, Blackbox has also satisfied the criteria for a Step 1 Prequalification approval for a Class C adult-use Cannabis License. To earn a Step 1 Prequalification approval for both licenses, BlackBox had to provide detailed information to the MRA on its sources of capitalization, corporate officers, directors, major shareholders, insurance compliance, financial statements attested to by a certified public accountant, and undergo extensive background checks. Blackbox has now begun the process for Step 2, which includes approval for a new medical marijuana facility that is being built in Pulaski, Michigan. Further, the company has obtained approval from the Township of Pulaski for three Class C Medicinal Use Cannabis Licenses conditioned on completing Step 2 with the Michigan Marijuana Regulatory Agency ("MRA"). In order to obtain Pulaski's approval, Blackbox had to provide site specific information, advise Pulaski of its facility construction documents, business plan, security arrangements, sanitation plan, and revenue projections. Final approval and licensing for both medicinal and adult-use licenses will occur upon completion of the Pulaski greenhouses, obtaining a Certificate of Occupancy, and a final MRA inspection. Project costs for development of the Pulaski property are now estimated at approximately 8.94 million. The company does not have the ability to fully fund the project; however, the company is diligently working to obtain the necessary financing to move forward with the project. Once the greenhouse facility is constructed, the company will submit a Step 2 application, which entails having the newly constructed facility inspected by the Bureau of Fire Services within 60 days after the Step 2 application is submitted. Failure to pass an inspection by the BFS within 60 days may result in the denial of the license. Blackbox is also required, by the MRA, to disclose the sources and total amount of capitalization that is required to operate and maintain a proposed marijuana facility. For a Class C license, Blackbox is required to show that they have 500,000 available to operate and maintain the facility. Completing the Step 2 process will allow the company to proceed with the cultivation of cannabis in Michigan. On November 4, 2020 the Company acquired all of the assets of V Brokers LLC dba as Veteran Hemp Co. Veteran Hemp Co. is a seller, broker and wholesaler of cannabidiol CBD products. The aggregate purchase price for the assets was 2,800,000 shares of the Company s common stock plus the assumption of certain liabilities. According to the merger agreement, the Company assumed certain liabilities. However, there were no liabilities with respect to the Veteran Hemp Co. assets or assigned contracts. The Company did assume a 70 hosting fee as part of the acquisition of the website. The acquisition closed in November 2020. As of December 31, 2022 Veteran Hemp Co. has generated approximately 2000 in revenue. Highly Relaxing LLC (the Company is an emerging Cannabidiol CBD therapeutic company located in Denver, CO that has topical agents and other creams and products. On December 6, 2022, the Company announced that it has closed on the purchase of a 10-acre property in Vassar Township, Michigan, The company plans to use the property for its cannabis business in the state, including indoor and outdoor growing, processing, wholesaling, and selling directly to consumers through dispensary operations. The transaction closed on December 5, 2022, at a purchase price of 600,000 5 Table of Contents Competition We face extreme competition from both larger, better-financed national brands as well as an ever-increasing number of boutique service providers in the cannabis industry. We currently track sixty-nine (69) such providers in this space and are continually monitoring their progress and presence in the industry while working to continue to demonstrate our unique licensing offering. We also track eighty-eight (88) public companies that are either directly in or loosely involved in the cannabis industry. Regulatory Considerations Marijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal laws. As of the date of this Prospectus 36 states and the District of Columbia allow its citizens to use Medical Marijuana. Additionally, 15 states and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis for recreational use by adults. The state laws are in conflict with the Federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level. The Biden Administration, if it follows Obama Administration policies, is not likely to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana. However, there is no guarantee that the Administration will not change its stated policy regarding the low-priority enforcement of federal laws. Additionally, any new administration that follows could change this policy and decide to enforce the federal laws strongly. Any such change in the Federal Government s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us. The Department of Justice has stated that it will continue to enforce the Controlled Substance Act with respect to marijuana to prevent: the distribution of marijuana to minors; criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels receiving revenue from the sale of marijuana; the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law to other states; state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana; driving while impaired and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use; the growing of marijuana on public lands; and marijuana possession or use on federal property. Laws and regulations affecting the medical marijuana industry are constantly changing, which could detrimentally affect our proposed operations. Local, state and federal medical marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter its business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on its operations. It is also possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our business. These ever-changing regulations could even affect federal tax policies that may make it difficult to claim tax deductions on our returns. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on its business. 6 Table of Contents Since the use of marijuana is illegal under federal law, most banks will not accept, for deposit, funds from businesses involved with marijuana. Consequently, businesses involved in the marijuana industry often have trouble finding a bank willing to accept their business. The inability to open bank accounts may make it difficult for us to operate. General As of the date of this prospectus we have one employee, Ms. Serkasevich, a member of our management. We have consulted with and expect to continue to use the services of independent consultants and contractors with whom our management has a pre-existing relationship to perform various professional services, particularly in the area of construction of cultivation. Our registered office is located at 8 The Green Suite 4000, Dover, DE 19901. Item 1A. Risk Factors. As a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable. Item 2. Properties. On December 6, 2022, the Company announced that it has closed on the purchase of a 10-acre property in Vassar Township, Michigan, The company plans to use the property for its cannabis business in the state, including indoor and outdoor growing, processing, wholesaling, and selling directly to consumers through dispensary operations. The transaction closed on December 5, 2022, at a purchase price of 600,000, with the company making a 75,000 down payment (12.5 of the purchase price). The company received a favorable annual interest rate of 4.75 , with monthly interest-only payments permitted and additional payments applied against principal. Under the terms of the land contract, the company will pay off the loan's principal within five years. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Not applicable. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.

The Company has not declared any dividends since incorporation and does not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain most, if not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to operate and expand our business. Our board of directors has discretion on whether to pay dividends unless the distribution would render us unable to repay our debts as they become due. Even if our board of directors decides to pay dividends, the form, frequency and amount will depend upon our future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant. 8 Table of Contents DILUTION If you purchase shares in this offering, you will experience dilution to the extent of the difference between the public offering price of the shares and the net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately after this offering.

To earn a Step 1 Prequalification approval for both licenses, BlackBox had to provide detailed information to the Michigan Marijuana Regulatory Agency ("MRA") on its sources of capitalization, corporate officers, directors, major shareholders, insurance compliance, financial statements attested to by a certified public accountant, and undergo extensive background checks. Blackbox has now begun the process for Step 2, which includes approval for a new medical marijuana facility to be built in Vassar, Michigan. Further, the Company has filed for approval from the Township of Vassar for one Class C Medicinal Use Cannabis License and one Class C Recreational Use Cannabis License conditioned on completing Step 2 with the MRA. In order to obtain Vassar's approval, Blackbox has to provide site specific information, advise Vassar of its facility construction documents, business plan, security arrangements, sanitation plan, and revenue projections. Final approval and licensing for both medicinal and adult-use licenses will occur upon completion of a Vassar greenhouse, obtaining a Certificate of Occupancy, and a final MRA inspection. Project costs for development of the Vassar property are now estimated at approximately 8.94 million. The company does not have the ability to fully fund the project; however, the company is diligently working to obtain the necessary financing to move forward with the project. Once the greenhouse facility is constructed, the company will submit a Step 2 application, which entails having the newly constructed facility inspected by the Bureau of Fire Services within 60 days after the Step 2 application is submitted. Failure to pass an inspection by the BFS within 60 days may result in the denial of the license. Blackbox is also required, by the MRA, to disclose the sources and total amount of capitalization that is required to operate and maintain a proposed marijuana facility. For a Class C license, Blackbox is required to show that they have 500,000 available to operate and maintain the facility. Completing the Step 2 process will allow the company to proceed with the cultivation of cannabis in Michigan. Once Blackbox receives a Class C marijuana license for adult use, they will be subject to various provisions and obligations, including the following: Under rule 420.102(1), one who holds a Class C marijuana license for adult use is permitted to grow 2,000 marijuana plants According to rule 420.102(4) of the MRA, A marijuana grower license authorizes a marijuana grower to transfer marijuana without using a marijuana secure transporter to a marijuana processor or marijuana retailer if both of the following are met: o (a) The marijuana processor or marijuana retailer occupies the same location as the marijuana grower and the marijuana is transferred using only private real property without accessing public roadways. o (b) The marijuana grower enters each transfer into the statewide monitoring system. Pursuant to rule 420.102(5), A marijuana grower license authorizes sale of marijuana, other than seeds, seedlings, tissue cultures, immature plants, and cuttings, to a marijuana processor or marijuana retailer. Under rule 420.102(7), A marijuana grower must enter all transactions, current inventory, and other information into the statewide monitoring system, known as METRC, as required in these rules. Under the METRC system: a serialized tag must be attached to every plant, and labels must be attached to wholesale packages According to rule 420.102(8), A marijuana grower license does not authorize the marijuana grower to operate in an area unless the area is zoned for industrial or agricultural use. At present, the Company is in compliance with this rule, as we intend to operate in an area that has been zoned for industrial and agricultural use. Under 420.102(9), A marijuana grower may accept the transfer of marijuana seeds, tissue cultures, and clones that do not meet the definition of marijuana plant in these rules at any time from another grower licensed under the acts, these rules, or both. Marijuana. Per rule 420.102(11), A marijuana grower licensee is required to comply with the requirements of the Michigan regulation and taxation of marijuana act and these rules. 11 Table of Contents With regard to a Class C marijuana license for medicinal use, the MRA imposes very similar provisions and obligations to those state above. According to rule R 420.108 of the MRA, one who possess a Class C marijuana license for medical use is subject to the following obligations: Under rule 420.108(1), one who holds a Class C marijuana license for medicinal use is only permitted to grow marijuana1,500 marijuana plants, as opposed to the 2,000 plants authorized for those who obtain an adult-use license Similar to the rule governing an adult-use license, marijuana under rule 420.108(3), a medicinal-use license authorizes a grower to transfer marijuana without using a secure transporter to a processor or provisioning center if both of the following are met: o (a) The processor or provisioning center occupies the same location as the grower and the marijuana is transferred using only private real property without accessing public roadways. o (b) The grower enters each transfer into the statewide monitoring system. According to rule 420.108(4), a grower license authorizes sale of marijuana, other than seeds, seedlings, tissue cultures, and cuttings, to a processor or a provisioning center. To be eligible for a grower license, the applicant and each investor in the grower must not have an interest in a secure transporter or safety compliance facility. Under rule 420.108(7), a medicinal-use license, like an adult-use license, requires a grower to enter all transactions, current inventory, and other information into the statewide monitoring system, known as METRC Similar to the rule for an adult-use license, under rule 420.108(8), a medicinal-use license does not authorize the grower to operate in an area unless the area is zoned for industrial or agricultural use. As mentioned, the Company is in compliance with this rule, as we intend to operate in an area that has been zoned for industrial and agricultural use. Our goal is to become a low-cost national or internationally branded cannabis company. Through cost measurement methods unused elsewhere by the industry, we will be able to measure costs of production by pound. With this information, we will target production costs of 150 to 350 per pound, and estimate selling cannabis at wholesale prices between 2,400 and 3,200. The end goal is to become a Multi-State Operator (MSO) that is fully integrated from seed to sale However, there are numerous other developments that will need to occur in order to allow us to implement the final aspects of our business plan and there are no assurances that any of these developments will occur, or if they do occur, that we will be successful in fully implementing our plan. Since inception of Hero Technologies, we have devoted the majority of our resources to acquiring assets and subsidiaries, organizing and staffing our company, business planning and execution, and raising capital. We have incurred recurring losses, the majority of which is attributable to minimal revenue, compensation expenses, consulting expenses, loss on the sale of a subsidiary, and losses on share conversion. We have funded our operations primarily through issuance of shares for services and proceeds from sale of stock. Our net loss was 541,583 for the year ended December 31, 2022, and 3,419,621 for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of 39,397,693. Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of compensation expenses, consulting expenses, and general and administrative expenditures. 12 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2022, the Company has not generated any revenue. Material changes in our Statement of Operations for the periods shown below compared to the prior periods are discussed below: Year ended December 31, 2022 Item Increase (I) or Decrease (D) Reason Consulting Expense D Less activity in cannabis licensing Impairment of Intangibles D Decreased due to less investment in cannabis assets Compensation Expense D Decreased due to a decline in the issuance of stock-based compensation Office, Travel and General D Decreased activity due to a decline in travel Professional Fees D Legal fees associated with obtaining a Michigan cannabis license were paid in 2021. Factors that will most significantly affect future operating results will be: Funding for construction of greenhouses in Michigan under Blackbox Timing related to construction and actual production of cannabis Wholesale cannabis prices in the state of Michigan Other than the foregoing we do not know of any trends, events or uncertainties that have had, or are reasonably expected to have, a material impact on our revenues or expenses.

Before its name change in 2020, the Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada under the name Holloman Energy Corporation. The Company had previously focused on oil and gas exploration in Australia s Cooper Basin. However, during 2019, the Company sold its remaining oil and gas assets and discontinued operations in the energy industry. On May 1, 2020, Holloman Energy Corporation Series A Preferred Shares were purchased by Magenta Value Holdings LLC. On July 20, 2020, the Company changed its name to Hero Technologies Inc. with the state of Nevada. After which, the Company begun making the transition into the cannabis industry. On September 10, 2020, Hero Technologies Inc. formed the company Blackbox Technologies and Systems LLC and entered into an operating agreement. The name was subsequently changed to Blackbox Systems and Technologies LLC. The Blackbox project consists of environmental growth chambers for the cultivation of large flowering plants based on aeroponic technology. On November 3, 2020, the Company purchased Veteran Hemp Co., which operates an international retail and wholesale online store selling cannabis and cannabidiol. On November 4, 2020, the Company purchased a www.highlrelaxing.com and began selling CBD topicals and rubs under the name Highly Relaxing . Today, Hero Technologies Inc. is a cannabis company with a vertically integrated business model and plan that includes cannabis genetic engineering, farmland for medical and recreational cannabis cultivation, production licenses, distribution licenses, consumer packaging, retail operations and dispensaries. The Company focuses on two principal segments of the cannabis industry, (i) cultivation and (ii) the dispensary business model, including combinations. The Company is an expanding vertically integrated, cannabis operator, focusing on high-growth markets. Hero Technologies Inc. pairs premier seed genetics and growing techniques, with plans to utilize and expand its growing technology/techniques to all its facilities and operations. The Company's business model includes cultivation, licensing operations, processing operations, processing facilities, sale of products, brand creation, and technology development. On December 6, 2022, the Company announced that it has closed on the purchase of a 10-acre property in Vassar Township, Michigan, The company plans to use the property for its cannabis business in the state, including indoor and outdoor growing, processing, wholesaling, and selling directly to consumers through dispensary operations. The transaction closed on December 5, 2022, at a purchase price of 600,000 15 Table of Contents Capital Resources and Liquidity Overview Since our inception, we have recognized limited revenue from our core cannabis operations and have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We have not yet commercialized any product from our planned aeroponic cultivation of cannabis, and we do not expect to generate revenue until completion of greenhouse buildouts. Since our inception through December 2022, we have funded our operations through proceeds from the sale of stock, borrowings on debt, and shares issued for service. We expect our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with the anticipated net proceeds from this offering, to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future. Our sources and (uses) of cash for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are shown below: 2022 2021 Cash provided by (used in) operations (185,152 (732,649 Cash provided by (used in) investing activities (75,000 - Cash provided by (used in) financing activities 120,000 470,000 Changes in exchange rates - - Our material capital commitments for the twelve months ending December 31, 2022 are: Description Amount (Include all amounts pertaining to Blackbox, cannabis licensing, pre-acquisition development, land acquisition construction, etc.) 9,000,000 Operating Activities During the year ended December 31, 2021, we used 732,649 of cash in operating activities. Cash used in operating activities reflected our net loss of 3,419,621 and a net increase of 150,431 in our operating assets and liabilities, offset by approximately 2,629,869 of noncash charges, which was driven by loss from conversion of debt to common stock. The primary use of cash was to fund our operations related to compensation expenses, consulting expenses, and professional fees. 16 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2022, we used 185,152 of cash in operating activities. Cash used in operating activities reflected our net loss of 541,583 and a net increase of 69,876 in our operating assets and liabilities, offset by approximately 312,801 of noncash charges, which was driven by loss from conversion of debt to common stock. The primary use of cash was to fund our operations related to compensation expenses, consulting expenses, and professional fees. Investing Activities During the year ended December 31, 2021 we received 0 for investing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we used 75,000 for the purchase of land. Financing Activities During the year ended December 31, 2021, financing activities provided 470,000, which was borrowed on debt and proceeds from the sale of stock. During the year ended December 31, 2022, financing activities provided 120,000, which was proceeds from the sale of stock. We anticipate material capital requirements of 9,000,000 for the twelve months ending December 31, 2022. Other than as disclosed above, we do not know of any trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in, or that are reasonably likely to result in, our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way. Other than as disclosed above, we do not know of any significant changes in our expected sources and uses of cash. We do not have any commitments or arrangements from any person to provide us with any equity capital. Our current losses, working capital deficit, and accumulated deficit raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our current operations are being funded by capital that has been raised through the issuance of capital stock. Additionally, we may decide to raise more capital in the future through private offerings, public offerings, and/or debt offerings. Funding Requirements Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, primarily consisting of compensation, consulting and professional fees and general administrative expenses. 17 Table of Contents Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated the cannabis industry, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: Regulatory and statutory developments regarding the legalization and commercialization of the marijuana industry in the United States Compensation expenses related to our growing platform Business development opportunities in the form of targeted acquisitions of subsidiaries Investment activities related to the construction and deployment of aeroponic growth technology. We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the cannabis industry and our core businesses, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings and/or debt financings. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of common stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate the implementation of our business plans. Critical Accounting Policies The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies, defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. See Note 2 to the December 31, 2022 Financial Statements included as part of this document for a summary of our significant accounting policies. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. It is possible that accounting estimates and assumptions may be material to the Company due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved. 18 Table of Contents Accounts Receivable The Company grants credit to customers under credit terms that it believes are customary in the industry and does not require collateral to support customer receivables. The Company currently does not provide an allowance for doubtful collections, which is based upon a review of outstanding receivables, historical collection information, and existing economic conditions. Normal receivable terms vary from 30-90 days after the issuance of the invoice and typically would be considered past due when the term expires. Delinquent receivables are written off based on individual credit evaluation and specific circumstances of the customer. Inventory Inventory is valued at the lower of the inventory's cost (first in, first out basis) or the current market price of the inventory. Management compares the cost of inventory with its market value and an allowance is made to write down inventory to market value, if lower. Long-Lived Assets The Company applies the provisions of ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment , which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. ASC 360 requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying amounts. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the long-lived assets. Loss on long-lived assets to be disposed of is determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for the cost of disposal. Revenue Recognition Net sales include product sales, less excise taxes and customer programs and incentives. The Company recognizes revenue by applying the following steps in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company recognizes sales when merchandise is shipped from a warehouse directly to wholesale customers (except in the case of a consignment sale). For consignment sales, the Company recognizes sales upon the consignee s shipment to the customer. Postage and handling charges billed to customers are also recognized as sales upon shipment of the related merchandise. Shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point, and title passes to the customer at the time and place of shipment or purchase by customers at a retail location. For consignment sales, title passes to the consignee concurrent with the consignee s shipment to the customer. The customer has no cancellation privileges after shipment or upon purchase at retail locations, other than customary rights of return. The Company excludes sales tax collected and remitted to various states from sales and cost of sales 19 Table of Contents Deferred Income In some instances, the Company receives payments prior to delivery of its products, whereupon such revenues are deferred until the revenue recognition criteria are met. Stock-Based Compensation The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation . FASB ASC Topic 718 requires companies to measure compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation at fair value at the grant date and recognize the expense over the employee's requisite service period. The Company recognizes in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees and non-employees. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. Going Concern Our net losses through December 31, 2022 raise some or substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Recent Accounting Pronouncements During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company adopted ASC 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 47020) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entities Own Equity (Subtopic 81540). ASC 2020-06 reduces the number of acceptable methods of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stocks. The implementation of ASC 2020-06 had no material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. Competition We face extreme competition from both larger, better-financed national brands as well as an ever-increasing number of boutique service providers in the cannabis industry. We currently track sixty-nine (69) such providers in this space and are continually monitoring their progress and presence in the industry while working to continue to demonstrate our unique licensing offering. We also track eighty-eight (88) public companies that are either directly in or loosely involved in the cannabis industry. 20 Table of Contents Regulatory Considerations Marijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal laws. As of the date of this Prospectus 36 states and the District of Columbia allow its citizens to use Medical Marijuana. Additionally, 15 states and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis for recreational use by adults. The state laws are in conflict with the Federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level. The Biden Administration, if it follows Obama Administration policies, is not likely to use of resources to direct law federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana. However, there is no guarantee that the Administration will not change its stated policy regarding the low-priority enforcement of federal laws. Additionally, any new administration that follows could change this policy and decide to enforce the federal laws strongly. Any such change in the Federal Government s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us. The Department of Justice has stated that it will continue to enforce the Controlled Substance Act with respect to marijuana to prevent: the distribution of marijuana to minors; criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels receiving revenue from the sale of marijuana; the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law to other states; state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana; driving while impaired and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use; the growing of marijuana on public lands; and marijuana possession or use on federal property. Laws and regulations affecting the medical marijuana industry are constantly changing, which could detrimentally affect our proposed operations. Local, state and federal medical marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter its business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on its operations. It is also possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our business. These ever-changing regulations could even affect federal tax policies that may make it difficult to claim tax deductions on our returns. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on its business. Since the use of marijuana is illegal under federal law, most banks will not accept, for deposit, funds from businesses involved with marijuana. Consequently, businesses involved in the marijuana industry often have trouble finding a bank willing to accept their business. The inability to open bank accounts may make it difficult for us to operate. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk . As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hero Technologies Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the two-year period then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered net losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans regarding those matters are discussed in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB . We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and the significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Going Concern Due to the net loss and negative cash flows from operations for the year, the Company evaluated the need for a going concern. Auditing management s evaluation of a going concern can be a significant judgment given the fact that the Company uses management estimates on future revenues and expenses which are not able to be easily substantiated. To evaluate the appropriateness of the lack of going concern paragraph in our audit opinion, we examined and evaluated the financial information that was the initial cause for this consideration along with management s plans to mitigate the going concern. /s/ M K CPAS, PLLC We have served as the Company s auditor since 2020 March 31, 2023 Auditor Firm ID: F-2 Table of Contents HERO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act ), the Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO (the Company s principal financial and accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as of December 31, 2022, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our Chief Executive Officer, as the principal executive officer (chief executive officer) and principal financial officer (chief financial officer), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, our internal controls and procedures may not prevent or detect misstatements. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The framework used by management in making that assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment, our management has determined that as of December 31, 2022, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective for the purposes for which it is intended based on the following material weaknesses: Lack of internal audit function . During 2022, the Company, upon review of the independent auditors, made some adjustments to its financial statements, including, adjusting salary amounts and the related tax accruals, correcting warrant expense for a warrant issued to a related party, and adding the liability due to our attorney that should have been recorded. Management believes that the foregoing is due to the fact that the Company lacks qualified resources to perform the internal audit functions properly and that the scope and effectiveness of the internal audit function are yet to be developed. Specifically, the reporting mechanism between the accounting department and the Board of Directors and the CEO was not effective, therefore resulting in the delay of recording and reporting. No Segregation of Duties Ineffective controls over financial reporting : As of December 31, 2022, we had no full-time employees with the requisite expertise in the key functional areas of finance and accounting. As a result, there is a lack of proper segregation of duties necessary to insure that all transactions are accounted for accurately and in a timely manner. 22 Table of Contents Lack of a functioning audit committee : Due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, and no audit committee has been elected, the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures is inadequate. Written Policies Procedures : Due to lack of written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting, the Company did not establish a formal process to close our books monthly and account for all transactions. Lack of controls over related party transactions: As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not establish a formal written policy for the approval, identification and authorization of related party transactions. We are developing a plan to ensure that all information will be recorded, processed, summarized and reported accurately, and as of the date of this report, we have hired a payroll service firm to manage all payroll functions including tax withholdings. We will take the following steps to address the above-referenced material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting: 1. We will continue to educate our management personnel to increase its ability to comply with the disclosure requirements and financial reporting controls; and 2. We will increase management oversight of accounting and reporting functions in the future; and 3. As soon as we can raise sufficient capital or our operations generate sufficient cash flow, we will hire personnel to handle our accounting and reporting functions. While the first two steps of our remediation process are ongoing, we do not expect to remediate the weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting until the time when we start to commercialize a recombinant fiber (and, therefore, may have sufficient cash flow for hiring personnel to handle our accounting and reporting functions). This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting No change in our system of internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B. Other Information. The registrant must disclose under this item any information required to be disclosed in a report on Form 8-K during the fourth quarter of the year covered by this Form 10-K, but not reported, whether or not otherwise required by this Form 10-K. If disclosure of such information is made under this item, it need not be repeated in a report on Form 8-K which would otherwise be required to be filed with respect to such information or in a subsequent report on Form 10-K. 23 Table of Contents PART III Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance. MANAGEMENT The following table sets forth the names, ages and positions held with respect to each Director and Executive Officer of the Company. Name Age Position Director Since Gina Serkasevich 53 Chief Financial Officer, Chief Executive Officer, Sole Director 2020 Ms. Gina Serkasevich has been our since Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Sole Director since November 2020. Between 2014 and 2020 Ms. Serkasevich was our Chief Financial and Accounting Officer. Previously, she was our Financial Controller and has more than 30 years of domestic and international corporate accounting and finance experience. Since July 2013, she has served as U.S. Controller for EFLO Energy, Inc. (OTCQB), a company focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas assets in North America. Prior to 2012, Ms. Serkasevich worked in the Oil and Gas Tanker Transportation industry as a Regional Financial Manager for AET Inc. Limited (2011-2012), as a Financial Consultant for OSG Ship Management, Inc. (NYSE -OSG) (2009-2011) and as a Financial Controller/CFO for Stena Bulk LLC (1998-2008). During her 11-year tenure at Stena Bulk LLC she established the financial, accounting and reporting requirements for the new joint ventures and tanker pools with Sonanagol USA and held the Company Secretary position on both of those companies boards of directors. We believe Ms. Serkasevich is qualified to act as a director due to her long-standing relationship with us. We have not adopted a code of ethics since we only have one officer and director. There are currently no committees of the Board of Directors. Our board of directors believes it is appropriate for us not to have a standing nominating, audit, or compensation committee because we only have one director. Thus, the size of our board of directors does not require establishing separate committees. Our board of directors has performed, and will perform adequately, the functions of any specific committee. The Board assesses on an ongoing basis the risks faced by the Company. These risks include financial, technological, competitive, and operational risks. In addition, since we do not have an audit committee, the Board is also responsible for the assessment and oversight of the Company's financial risk exposures. We do not have any directors who are "independent" as such term is defined by the applicable listing standards of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. Item 11. Executive Compensation.
