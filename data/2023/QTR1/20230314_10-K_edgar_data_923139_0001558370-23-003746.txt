PART I As used in this Report, the words we, us, our and the Company are used to refer to Flushing Financial Corporation (the Holding Company and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, Flushing Bank (the Bank ), Flushing Service Corporation, FSB Properties Inc., and Flushing Preferred Funding Corporation, which was dissolved as of June 30, 2021. Item 1. Business. GENERAL Overview The Holding Company is a Delaware corporation organized in 1994. The Bank was organized in 1929 as a New York State-chartered mutual savings bank. Today the Bank operates as a full-service New York State commercial bank. Our primary business is the operation of the Bank. The Bank owned two subsidiaries during 2022: Flushing Service Corporation and FSB Properties Inc. The Bank also operates an internet branch (the Internet Branch ), which operates under the brands of iGObanking.com and BankPurely . The activities of the Holding Company are primarily funded by dividends, if any, received from the Bank, issuances of subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt, and issuances of equity securities. The Holding Company s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol FFIC. The Holding Company also owns Flushing Financial Capital Trust II, Flushing Financial Capital Trust III, and Flushing Financial Capital Trust IV (the Trusts ), which are special purpose business trusts formed to issue a total of 60.0 million of capital securities and 1.9 million of common securities (which are the only voting securities). The Holding Company owns 100 of the common securities of the Trusts. The Trusts used the proceeds from the issuance of these securities to purchase junior subordinated debentures from the Holding Company. The Trusts are not included in our consolidated financial statements as we would not absorb the losses of the Trusts if losses were to occur. Unless otherwise disclosed, the information presented in this Annual Report reflects the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. Management views the Company as operating a single unit a community bank. Therefore, segment information is not provided. At December 31, 2022, the Company had total assets of 8.4 billion, deposits of 6.5 billion and stockholders equity of 0.7 billion.

 On October 30, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of Empire Bancorp, Inc. Empire ), in a transaction valued at 87.5 million upon closing, all outstanding shares of Empire voting and non-voting common stock were exchanged for consideration consisting of 54.8 million in cash and 2,557,028 shares of Holding Company common stock. Goodwill of 1.5 million was recorded as a result of the Empire acquisition. Our principal business is attracting retail deposits from the general public and investing those deposits together with funds generated from ongoing operations and borrowings, primarily in (1) originations and purchases of multi-family residential properties loans, commercial business loans, commercial real estate mortgage loans and, to a lesser extent, one-to-four family loans (focusing on mixed-use properties, which are properties that contain both residential dwelling units and commercial units); (2) construction loans; (3) Small Business Administration SBA loans; (4) mortgage loan surrogates such as mortgage-backed securities; and (5) U.S. government securities, corporate fixed-income securities and other marketable securities. We also originate certain other consumer loans including overdraft lines of credit. At December 31, 2022, we had gross loans outstanding of 6,925.8 million, with gross mortgage loans totaling 5,380.9 million, or 77.7 of gross loans, and non-mortgage loans totaling 1,544.8 million, or 22.3 of gross loans. Mortgage loans are primarily multi-family, commercial and one-to-four family mixed-use properties, which represent 73.2 of gross loans. Our revenues are derived principally from interest on loans, our mortgage-backed securities portfolio, and interest and dividends on other investments in our securities portfolio. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank of New York FHLB-NY borrowings, principal and interest payments on loans, mortgage-backed, other securities and to a lesser extent proceeds from sales of securities and loans. The Bank s primary regulator is the New York State Department of Financial Services NYDFS ), and its primary federal regulator is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ). Deposits are insured to the maximum allowable amount by the FDIC. Additionally, the Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB system. According to the New York Department of Labor, the unemployment rate for the New York City region decreased to 5.9 at December 2022 from 8.8 at December 2021. Although, the unemployment rate improved year-over-year, the rate is still elevated compared to many parts of the United States. Non-performing loans totaled 32.4 million, 14.9 million, and 21.1 million at December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. We had net charge-offs of impaired loans in 2022 totaling 1.5 million compared to 3.1 million and 3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The Company recorded a provision (benefit) for credit losses on loans totaling 4.8 million, 4.9) million, and 22.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The provision recorded in 2022 was primarily due to loan growth, increased reserves on specific credits, coupled with the ongoing environmental uncertainty resulting from high and rising inflation including increasing interest rates. The benefit recorded in 2021 was primarily due to improving economic conditions. The provision recorded in 2020 was primarily due to deteriorating economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Market Area and Competition We are a community oriented commercial bank offering a wide variety of financial services to meet the needs of the communities we serve. The Bank s main office and its executive offices are in Uniondale, New York, located in Nassau County. At December 31, 2022, the Bank operated 25 full-service offices and the Internet Branch. We have offices located in the New York City Boroughs of Queens, Brooklyn, and Manhattan, and in Nassau and Suffolk County, New York. The vast majority of all of our mortgage loans are secured by properties located in the New York City metropolitan area.

 We face intense competition both in making loans and in attracting deposits. Our market area has a high density of financial institutions, many of which have greater financial resources, name recognition and market presence than we do, and all of which are competitors to varying degrees. Particularly intense competition exists for deposits, as we compete with 109 banks and thrifts in the counties in which we have branch locations. Our market share of deposits, as of June 30, 2022, in these counties was 0.30 of the total deposits of these FDIC insured competing financial institutions, and we are the 25th largest financial institution. 1 In addition, we compete with credit unions, the stock market and mutual funds for customers funds. Competition for deposits in our market and for national brokered deposits is primarily based on the types of deposits offered and rate paid on the deposits. Particularly intense competition also exists in all of the lending activities we emphasize. In addition to the financial institutions mentioned above, we compete against mortgage banks and insurance companies located both within our market and available on the internet. Competition for loans in our market is primarily based on the types of loans offered and the related terms for these loans, including fixed-rate versus adjustable-rate loans and the interest rate on the loan. For adjustable-rate loans, competition is also based on the repricing period, the index to which the rate is referenced, and the spread over the index rate. Also, competition is influenced by the ability of a financial institution to respond to customer requests and to provide the borrower with a timely decision to approve or deny the loan application. The internet banking arena also has many larger financial institutions which have greater financial resources, name recognition and market presence than we do. Our future earnings prospects will be affected by our ability to compete effectively with other financial institutions and to implement our business strategies. Our strategy for attracting deposits includes using various marketing techniques, delivering enhanced technology and customer friendly banking services, and focusing on the unique personal and small business banking needs of the multi-ethnic communities we serve. Our strategy for attracting new loans is primarily dependent on providing timely response to applicants and maintaining a network of quality brokers and other business sources. See Risk Factors The Markets in Which We Operate Are Highly Competitive included in Item 1A of this Annual Report. For a discussion of our business strategies, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Management Strategy included in Item 7 of this Annual Report. Lending Activities Loan Portfolio Composition . Our loan portfolio consists primarily of mortgage loans secured by multi-family residential, commercial real estate, one-to-four family mixed-use property, one-to-four family residential property, and commercial business loans. In addition, we also offer construction loans, SBA loans and other consumer loans. The vast majority of our mortgage loans are secured by properties located within our market area. At December 31, 2022, we had gross loans outstanding of 6,925.8 million. We have focused our loan origination efforts on multi-family residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate and commercial business loans with full banking relationships. All of these loan types generally include prepayment penalties that we collect if the loans pay in full prior to the contractual maturity. We expect to continue this emphasis through marketing and by maintaining competitive interest rates and origination fees. Our marketing efforts include frequent contact with mortgage brokers and other professionals who serve as referral sources.

 Fully underwritten one-to-four family residential mortgage loans generally are considered by the banking industry to have less risk than other types of loans. Multi-family residential, commercial real estate and one-to-four family mixed-use property mortgage loans generally have higher yields than one-to-four family residential property mortgage loans and shorter terms to maturity, but typically involve higher principal amounts and may expose the lender to a greater risk of credit loss than one-to-four family residential property mortgage loans. The greater risk associated with multi-family residential, commercial real estate and one-to-four family mixed-use property mortgage loans could require us to increase our provisions for credit losses and to maintain an allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans in excess of the allowance we currently maintain. We continually review the composition of our mortgage loan portfolio to manage the risk in the portfolio. See General Overview in this Item 1 of this Annual Report. Our loan portfolio consists of adjustable-rate ARM and fixed-rate loans. Interest rates we charge on loans are affected primarily by the demand for such loans, the supply of money available for lending purposes, the rate offered by our competitors and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Many of those factors are, in turn, affected by local, regional and national economic conditions, and the fiscal, monetary and tax policies of the federal, state and local governments. In general, consumers show a preference for ARM loans in periods of high interest rates and for fixed-rate loans when interest rates are low. In periods of declining interest rates, we may experience refinancing activity in ARM loans, as borrowers show a preference to lock-in the lower rates available on fixed-rate loans. In the case of ARM loans we originated, volume and adjustment periods are affected by the interest rates and other market factors as discussed above as well as consumer preferences. We have not in the past, nor do we currently, originate ARM loans that provide for negative amortization. The majority of our commercial business loans are generated by the Company s business banking group which focuses on loan and deposit relationships to businesses located within our market area. These loans are generally personally guaranteed by the owners, and may be secured by the assets of the business, which at times may include real estate. The interest rate on these loans are generally adjustable based on a published index. These loans, while providing us a higher rate of return, also present a higher level of risk. The greater risk associated with commercial business loans could require us to increase our provision for credit losses, and to maintain an allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans in excess of the allowance we currently maintain. At times, we may purchase whole or participations in loans from banks, mortgage bankers and other financial institutions when the loans complement our loan portfolio strategy. Loans purchased must meet our underwriting standards when they were originated. Our lending activities are subject to federal and state laws and regulations. See Regulation. The following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio at the dates indicated:

Loans secured by multi-family residential properties were 2,601.4 million, or 37.57 of gross loans, at December 31, 2022. Our multi-family residential mortgage loans had an average principal balance of 1.1 million at December 31, 2022, and the largest multi-family residential mortgage loan held in our portfolio had a principal balance of 24.9 million. We offer both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate multi-family residential mortgage loans, with maturities of up to 30 years. In underwriting multi-family residential mortgage loans, we review the expected net operating income generated by the real estate collateral securing the loan, the age and condition of the collateral, the financial resources and income level of the borrower and the borrower s experience in owning or managing similar properties. We typically require debt service coverage of at least 125 of the monthly loan payment. We generally originate these loans up to only 75 of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property, whichever is less. Any loan with a final loan-to-value ratio in excess of 75 must be approved by the Board of Directors of the Bank (the Bank Board of Directors or the Loan Committee as an exception to policy. We generally rely on the income generated by the property as the primary means by which the loan is repaid. However, personal guarantees may be obtained for additional security from these borrowers. We typically order an environmental report on our multi-family and commercial real estate loans. Loans secured by multi-family residential property generally involve a greater degree of risk than residential mortgage loans and carry larger loan balances. The increased credit risk is the result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a smaller number of loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic conditions on income producing properties and the increased difficulty in evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Furthermore, the repayment of loans secured by multi-family residential property is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related property, which is usually owned by a legal entity with the property being the entity s only asset. If the cash flow from the property is reduced, the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. If the borrower defaults, our only remedy may be to foreclose on the property, for which the market value may be less than the balance due on the related mortgage loan. Loans secured by multi-family residential property also may involve a greater degree of environmental risk. We seek to protect against this risk through obtaining an environmental report. See Asset Quality Environmental Concerns Relating to Loans.

 At December 31, 2022, 2,189.8 million, or 84.18 , of our multi-family mortgage loans consisted of ARM loans. We offer ARM loans with adjustment periods typically of five years and for terms of up to 30 years. Interest rates on ARM loans currently offered by us are adjusted at the beginning of each adjustment period based upon a fixed spread above the FHLB-NY corresponding Regular Advance Rate. From time to time, due to competitive forces, we may originate ARM loans at an initial rate lower than the fully indexed rate as a result of a discount on the spread for the initial adjustment period. Multi-family adjustable-rate mortgage loans generally are not subject to limitations on interest rate increases either on an adjustment period or aggregate basis over the life of the loan; however, the loans generally contain interest rate floors. We originated and purchased multi-family ARM loans totaling 392.0 million, 188.7 million, and 173.6 million during 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2022, 411.6 million, or 15.82 , of our multi-family mortgage loans consisted of fixed rate loans.

Loans secured by commercial real estate were 1,913.0 million, or 27.62 of gross loans, at December 31, 2022.

We offer ARM loans with adjustment periods of one to five years and generally for terms of up to 15 years. Interest rates on ARM loans currently offered by us are adjusted at the beginning of each adjustment period based upon a fixed spread above the FHLB-NY corresponding Regular Advance Rate. From time to time, we may originate ARM loans at an initial rate lower than the index as a result of a discount on the spread for the initial adjustment period. Commercial adjustable-rate mortgage loans generally are not subject to limitations on interest rate increases either on an adjustment period or aggregate basis over the life of the loan; however, the loans generally contain interest rate floors. We originated and purchased commercial ARM loans totaling 273.1 million, 148.8 million, and 134.0 million during 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

Table of Contents 
 At December 31, 2022, 358.1 million, or 64.60 , of our one-to-four family mixed-use property mortgage loans consisted of ARM loans. We offer adjustable-rate one-to-four family mixed-use property mortgage loans with adjustment periods typically of five years and for terms of up to 30 years. Interest rates on ARM loans currently offered by the Bank are adjusted at the beginning of each adjustment period based upon a fixed spread above the FHLB-NY corresponding Regular Advance Rate. From time to time, we may originate ARM loans at an initial rate lower than the index as a result of a discount on the spread for the initial adjustment period. One-to-four family mixed-use property adjustable-rate mortgage loans generally are not subject to limitations on interest rate increases either on an adjustment period or aggregate basis over the life of the loan; however, the loans generally contain interest rate floors. We originated and purchased one-to-four family mixed-use property ARM loans totaling 15.7 million, 15.1 million, and 10.0 million during 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2022, 196.2 million, or 35.40 , of our one-to-four family mixed-use property mortgage loans consisted of fixed-rate loans. Our fixed-rate one-to-four family mixed-use property mortgage loans are originated for terms of up to 15 years and are competitively priced based on market conditions and the Bank s cost of funds. We originated and purchased 21.9 million, 26.0 million, and 25.2 million of fixed-rate one-to-four family mixed-use property mortgage loans in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. One-to-Four Family Mortgage Lending Residential Properties. We offer mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties, including townhouses and condominium units. For purposes of the description contained in this section, one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, co-operative apartment loans and home equity loans are collectively referred to herein as residential mortgage loans. We offer both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans with maturities of up to 30 years and a general maximum loan amount of 1.0 million. Residential mortgage loans were 241.2 million, or 3.48 of gross loans, at December 31, 2022. We generally originate residential mortgage loans in amounts up to 80 of the appraised value or the sale price, whichever is less. Private mortgage insurance is required whenever loan-to-value ratios exceed 80 of the appraised value of the property securing the loan. At December 31, 2022, 215.8 million, or 89.45 , of our residential mortgage loans consisted of ARM loans. We offer ARM loans with adjustment periods of one, three, five, seven or ten years. Interest rates on ARM loans currently offered by us are adjusted at the beginning of each adjustment period based upon a fixed spread above the FHLB-NY corresponding Regular Advance Rate. From time to time, we may originate ARM loans at an initial rate lower than the index as a result of a discount on the spread for the initial adjustment period. ARM loans generally are subject to limitations on interest rate increases of 2 per adjustment period and an aggregate adjustment of 6 over the life of the loan and have interest rate floors. We originated and purchased residential ARM loans totaling 21.7 million, 70.2 million, and 18.3 million during 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The retention of ARM loans in our portfolio helps us reduce our exposure to interest rate risks. However, in an environment of rapidly increasing interest rates, it is possible for the interest rate increase to exceed the maximum aggregate adjustment on one-to-four family residential ARM loans and negatively affect the spread between our interest income and our cost of funds. ARM loans generally involve credit risks different from those inherent in fixed-rate loans, primarily because if interest rates rise, the underlying payments of the borrower rise, thereby increasing the potential for default. However, this potential risk is lessened by our policy of originating one-to-four family residential ARM loans with annual and lifetime interest rate caps that limit the increase of a borrower s monthly payment. At December 31, 2022, 25.4 million, or 10.55 , of our residential mortgage loans consisted of fixed-rate loans. Our fixed-rate residential mortgage loans typically are originated for terms of 15 and 30 years and are competitively priced based on market conditions and our cost of funds. We originated and purchased 3.3 million, 0.8 million, and 4.2 million in fixed-rate residential mortgages in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2022, home equity loans totaled 22.6 million, or 0.33 , of gross loans. Home equity loans are included in our portfolio of residential mortgage loans. These loans are offered as adjustable-rate home equity lines of credit on which interest only is due for an initial term of 10 years and thereafter principal and interest payments sufficient to liquidate the loan are required for the remaining term, not to exceed 30 years. These adjustable home equity lines of

 credit may include a floor and/or a ceiling on the interest rate that we charge for these loans. These loans also may be offered as fully amortizing closed-end fixed-rate loans for terms up to 15 years. The majority of home equity loans originated are owner occupied one-to-four family residential properties and condominium units. To a lesser extent, home equity loans are also originated on one-to-four residential properties held for investment and second homes. All home equity loans are subject to an 80 loan-to-value ratio computed on the basis of the aggregate of the first mortgage loan amount outstanding and the proposed home equity loan. They are generally granted in amounts from 25,000 to 300,000. Construction Loans. At December 31, 2022, construction loans totaled 71.0 million, or 1.02 , of gross loans. Our construction loans primarily are adjustable-rate loans to finance the construction of one-to-four family residential properties, multi-family residential properties and owner-occupied commercial properties. We also, to a limited extent, finance the construction of commercial properties. Our policies provide that construction loans may be made in amounts up to 70 of the estimated value of the developed property and only if we obtain a first lien position on the underlying real estate. Construction loans are generally made with terms of two years or less. Advances are made as construction progresses and inspection warrants, subject to continued title searches to ensure that we maintain a first lien position. We originated and purchased construction loans totaling 31.6 million, 38.1 million, and 21.9 million during 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Construction loans involve a greater degree of risk than other loans because, among other things, the underwriting of such loans is based on an estimated value of the developed property, which can be difficult to ascertain in light of uncertainties inherent in such estimations. In addition, construction lending entails the risk that the project may not be completed due to cost overruns or changes in market conditions. Small Business Administration Lending . At December 31, 2022, SBA loans totaled 23.3 million, representing 0.34 of gross loans. These loans are extended to small businesses and are guaranteed by the SBA up to a maximum of 85 of the loan balance for loans with balances of 150,000 or less, and to a maximum of 75 of the loan balance for loans with balances greater than 150,000. We also provide term loans and lines of credit up to 350,000 under the SBA Express Program, on which the SBA provides a 50 guaranty. The maximum loan size under the SBA guarantee program is 5.0 million, with a maximum loan guarantee of 3.75 million. All SBA loans are underwritten in accordance with SBA Standard Operating Procedures which requires collateral and the personal guarantee of the owners with more than 20 ownership from SBA borrowers. Typically, SBA loans are originated in the range of 25,000 to 2.0 million with terms ranging from one to seven years and up to 25 years for owner occupied commercial real estate mortgages. SBA loans are generally offered at adjustable-rates tied to the prime rate (as published in the Wall Street Journal with adjustment periods of one to three months. At times, we may sell the guaranteed portion of certain SBA term loans in the secondary market, realizing a gain at the time of sale, and retaining the servicing rights on these loans, collecting a servicing fee of approximately 1 . The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act created the SBA Paycheck Protection Program SBA PPP ). The SBA guarantees 100 of the amounts loaned by preferred banks. These loans are extended to small businesses with less than 500 employees that were in business prior to February 15, 2020 with loan amounts of 10.0 million or less to cover their payroll costs, health care benefits (including paid sick or medical leave, and insurance premiums), mortgage interest obligations of business, rent obligations, utility payments, interest on other debt obligations with terms ranging up to two years with no interest payments required for six months from the date of disbursement. We originated and purchased SBA loans totaling 3.5 million, 143.4 million (including 138.7 million of SBA PPP loans), and 112.4 million (including 111.6 million of SBA PPP loans), during 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

 Commercial Business and Other Lending. At December 31, 2022, commercial business and other loans totaled 1,521.5 million, or 21.97 , of gross loans. We originate and purchase commercial business loans and other loans for business, personal, or household purposes. Commercial business loans are provided to businesses in the New York City metropolitan area with annual sales of up to 250.0 million. Our commercial business loans include lines of credit and term loans including owner occupied mortgages. These loans are secured by business assets, including accounts receivables, inventory, equipment and real estate and generally require personal guarantees. The Bank also enters into participations/syndications on senior secured commercial business loans, which are serviced by other banks. Commercial business loans are generally originated in a range of 100,000 to 10.0 million. We generally offer adjustable-rate loans with adjustment periods of five years for owner occupied mortgages and for lines of credit the adjustment period is generally monthly. Interest rates on adjustable-rate loans currently offered by us are adjusted at the beginning of each adjustment period based upon a fixed spread above the FHLB-NY corresponding Regular Advance Rate for owner occupied mortgages and a fixed spread above the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR or Prime Rate for lines of credit. Beginning in mid-2023 these loans will no longer reprice using LIBOR and will reprice on an alternative index, such as Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), which is intended to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. Commercial business adjustable-rate loans generally are not subject to limitations on interest rate increases either on an adjustment period or aggregate basis over the life of the loan, however they generally are subject to interest rate floors. Our fixed-rate commercial business loans are generally originated for terms up to 20 years and are competitively priced based on market conditions and our cost of funds. We originated and purchased 637.0 million, 540.4 million, and 397.7 million of commercial business loans during 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Other loans generally consist of overdraft lines of credit. Generally, unsecured consumer loans are limited to amounts of 5,000 or less for terms of up to five years. We originated and purchased 4.4 million, 4.6 million, and 10.0 million of other loans during 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The underwriting standards employed by us for consumer and other loans include a determination of the applicant s payment history on other debts and assessment of the applicant s ability to meet payments on all of his or her obligations. In addition to the creditworthiness of the applicant, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral, if any, to the proposed loan amount. Unsecured loans tend to have higher risk, and therefore command a higher interest rate. Loan Extensions, Renewals, Modifications and Restructuring . Extensions, renewals, modifications or restructuring a loan, other than a loan that is classified as troubled debt restructured TDR ), requires the loan to be fully underwritten in accordance with our policy. The borrower must be current to have a loan extended, renewed, or restructured. Our policy for modifying a mortgage loan due to the borrower s request for changes in the terms will depend on the changes requested. The borrower must be current and have a good payment history to have a loan modified. If the borrower is seeking additional funds, the loan is fully underwritten in accordance with our policy for new loans. If the borrower is seeking a reduction in the interest rate due to a decline in interest rates in the market, we generally limit our review as follows: (1) for income producing properties and commercial business loans, to a review of the operating results of the property/business and a satisfactory inspection of the property, and (2) for one-to-four residential properties, to a satisfactory inspection of the property. Our policy on restructuring a loan when the loan will be classified as a TDR requires the loan to be fully underwritten in accordance with Company policy. The borrower must demonstrate the ability to repay the loan under the new terms. When the restructuring results in a TDR, we may waive some requirements of Company policy provided the borrower has demonstrated the ability to meet the requirements of the restructured loan and repay the restructured loan. While our formal lending policies do not prohibit making additional loans to a borrower or any related interest of the borrower who is past due in principal or interest more than 90 days, it has been our practice not to make additional loans to a borrower or a related interest of the borrower if the borrower is past due more than 90 days as to principal or interest. During the most recent three fiscal years, we did not make any additional loans to a borrower or any related interest of the borrower who was past due in principal or interest more than 90 days. All extensions, renewals, restructurings, and modifications must be approved by the appropriate Loan Committee. Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. The Board of Directors of the Company (the Board of Directors approved lending policies establishing loan approval requirements for our various types of loan products. Our Residential Mortgage Lending Policy (which applies to all one-to-four family mortgage loans, including residential and mixed-use property) establishes authorized levels of approval. One-to-four family mortgage loans that do not exceed 750,000 require two signatures for approval, one of which must be from either the President, Senior Executive Vice President Chief of Real Estate Lending, the Executive Vice President of Residential, Mixed Use Small Multi-family Lending or Executive Vice President Real Estate Credit Center (collectively, Authorized Officers and the other from a Senior Underwriter,

Loan proposals in excess of 5.0 million up to and including 25.0 million that are approved by Management Loan Committee will subsequently be submitted to either the Directors Loan Committee and/or the Board of Directors for their approval. Construction loans in excess of 25.0 million require the subsequent approval of the Bank Board of Directors. Any loan, regardless of type, that deviates from our written credit policies must be approved by the Director s Loan Committee or the Bank Board of Directors. For all loans originated by us, upon receipt of a completed loan application, a credit report is ordered, and certain other financial information is obtained. An appraisal of the real estate intended to secure the proposed loan is required to be received. An independent appraiser designated and approved by us currently performs such appraisals. Our staff appraisers review all appraisals. The Bank Board of Directors annually approves the independent appraisers used by the Bank and approves the Bank s appraisal policy. It is our policy to require borrowers to obtain title insurance and hazard insurance on all real estate loans prior to closing. For certain borrowers, and/or as required by law, the Bank may require escrow funds on a monthly basis together with each payment of principal and interest to a mortgage escrow account from which we make disbursements for items such as real estate taxes and, in some cases, hazard insurance premiums. Loan Concentrations. The maximum amount of credit that the Bank can extend to any single borrower or related group of borrowers generally is limited to 15 of the Bank s unimpaired capital and surplus, or 137.3 million at December 31, 2022. Applicable laws and regulations permit an additional amount of credit to be extended, equal to 10 of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. See -Regulation. However, it is currently our policy not to extend such additional credit. At December 31, 2022, there were no loans in excess of the maximum dollar amount of loans to one borrower that the Bank was authorized to make. At that date, the Bank s three largest aggregate amount of outstanding loans to one borrower were 109.4 million, 83.3 million, and 76.5 million for each of the three borrowers, all of which were performing according to their terms.

 Loan Servicing . At December 31, 2022, we were servicing 52.1 million of loans for others. Our policy is to retain the servicing rights to the mortgage and SBA loans that we sell in the secondary market, other than sales of delinquent loans, which are sold with servicing released to the buyer. On mortgage loans and commercial business loan participations purchased by us for whom the seller retains the servicing rights, we receive monthly reports with which we monitor the loan portfolio. Based upon servicing agreements with the servicers of the loans, we rely upon the servicer to contact delinquent borrowers, collect delinquent amounts and initiate foreclosure proceedings, when necessary, all-in accordance with applicable laws, regulations and the terms of the servicing agreements between us and our servicing agents. The servicers are required to submit monthly reports on their collection efforts on delinquent loans. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we held 460.0 million and 653.4 million, respectively, of loans that were serviced by others. Asset Quality Loan Collection . When a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan, except for serviced loans as described above, we take a number of steps to induce the borrower to cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status. In the case of mortgage loans, personal contact is made with the borrower after the loan becomes 30 days delinquent. We take a proactive approach to managing delinquent loans, including conducting site examinations, and encouraging borrowers to meet with one of our representatives. When deemed appropriate, we develop short-term payment plans that enable borrowers to bring their loans current, generally within six to nine months. We review delinquencies on a loan-by-loan basis, diligently exploring ways to help borrowers meet their obligations and return them back to current status. In the case of commercial business or other loans, we generally send the borrower a written notice of non-payment when the loan is first past due. In the event payment is not then received, additional letters and phone calls generally are made in order to encourage the borrower to meet with one of our representatives to discuss the delinquency. If the loan still is not brought current and it becomes necessary for us to take legal action, which typically occurs after a loan is delinquent 90 days or more, we may attempt to repossess personal or business property that secures a SBA loan, commercial business loan or consumer loan. When the borrower has indicated that they will be unable to bring the loan current, or due to other circumstances which, in our opinion, indicate the borrower will be unable to bring the loan current within a reasonable time, the loan is classified as non-performing. All loans classified as non-performing, which includes all loans past due 90 days or more, are on non-accrual status unless there is, in our opinion, compelling evidence the borrower will bring the loan current in the immediate future. At December 31, 2022, there was one loan for 2.6 million that was past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest. Upon classifying a loan as non-performing, we review available information and conditions that relate to the status of the loan, including the estimated value of the loan s collateral and any legal considerations that may affect the borrower s ability to continue to make payments. Based upon the available information, we will consider the sale of the loan or retention of the loan. If the loan is retained, we may continue to work with the borrower to collect the amounts due or start foreclosure proceedings. If a foreclosure action is initiated and the loan is not brought current, paid in full, or refinanced before the foreclosure sale, the real property securing the loan is sold at foreclosure or by us as soon thereafter as practicable. Once the decision to sell a loan is made, we determine what we would consider adequate consideration to be obtained when that loan is sold, based on the facts and circumstances related to that loan. Investors and brokers are then contacted to seek interest in purchasing the loan. We have been successful in finding buyers for our non-performing loans offered for sale that are willing to pay what we consider to be adequate consideration. Terms of the sale include cash due upon closing of the sale, no contingencies or recourse to us, servicing is released to the buyer and time is of the essence. These sales usually close within a reasonably short time period. This strategy of selling non-performing loans has allowed us to optimize our return by quickly converting our non-performing loans to cash, which can then be reinvested in earning assets. This strategy also allows us to avoid lengthy and costly legal proceedings that may occur with non-performing loans. There can be no assurances that we will continue this strategy in the future, or if continued, we will be able to find buyers to pay adequate consideration.

For borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties, we have restructured certain problem loans by: reducing the interest rate until the next reset date, extending the amortization period thereby lowering the monthly payments, deferring a portion of the interest payment, and/or changing the loan to interest only payments for a limited time period. At times, certain problem loans have been restructured by combining more than one of these options. These restructurings have not included a reduction of principal balance. We believe that restructuring these loans in this manner will allow certain borrowers to become and remain current on their loans. These restructured loans are classified TDR. Loans which have been current for six consecutive months at the time they are restructured as TDR remain on accrual status. Loans which were delinquent at the time they are restructured as a TDR are placed on non-accrual status until they have made timely payments for six consecutive months. The following table shows loans classified as TDR at amortized cost that are performing according to their restructured terms at the periods indicated:

At December 31, 2021, there were no loans which were restructured as TDR not performing in accordance with its restructured terms. Delinquent Loans and Non-performing Assets . We generally discontinue accruing interest on delinquent loans when a loan is 90 days past due. At that time, previously accrued but uncollected interest is reversed from income. Loans in default 90 days or more as to their maturity date but not their interest payments, however, continue to accrue interest as long as the borrower continues to timely remit interest payments.

We aggressively market our Other Real Estate Owned OREO properties. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we held no OREO. We may obtain physical possession of residential real estate collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan via foreclosure through an in-substance repossession. During the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, we did not foreclose any real estate property. Included within net loans as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, was a recorded investment of 5.2 million and 8.7 million, respectively, of consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process according to local requirements of the applicable jurisdiction. Environmental Concerns Relating to Loans. We currently obtain environmental reports in connection with the underwriting of commercial real estate loans, and typically obtain environmental reports in connection with the underwriting of multi-family loans. For all other loans, we obtain environmental reports only if the nature of the current or, to the extent known to us, prior use of the property securing the loan indicates a potential environmental risk. However, we may not be aware of such uses or risks in any case, and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that real estate acquired by us in foreclosure is free from environmental contamination nor that we will not have any liability with respect thereto. Classified Assets. Our policy is to review our assets, focusing primarily on the loan portfolio, OREO, and the investment portfolios, to ensure that the credit quality is maintained at the highest levels. When weaknesses are identified, immediate action is taken to correct the problem through direct contact with the borrower or issuer. We then monitor these assets, and, in accordance with our policy and current regulatory guidelines, we designate them as Special Mention, which is considered a Criticized Asset, and Substandard, Doubtful, or Loss which are considered Classified Assets, as deemed necessary. If a loan does not fall within one of the previous mentioned categories and management believes weakness is evident then we designate the loan as Watch , all other loans would be considered Pass . These loan designations are updated quarterly. We designate an asset as Substandard when a well-defined weakness is identified that jeopardizes the orderly liquidation of the debt. We designate an asset as Doubtful when it displays the inherent weakness of a Substandard asset with the added provision that collection of the debt in full, on the basis of existing facts, is highly improbable. We designate an asset as Loss if it is deemed the debtor is incapable of repayment. We do not hold any loans designated as loss, as loans that are designated as Loss are charged to the Allowance for Credit Losses. Assets that are non-accrual are designated as Substandard, Doubtful or Loss. We designate an asset as Special Mention if the asset does not warrant designation within one of the other categories but contains a potential weakness that deserves closer attention. Our Criticized and Classified Assets totaled 88.9 million at December 31, 2022, an increase of 10.6 million from 78.3 million at December 31, 2021.

Loans are charged off against that ACL when management believes that a loan balance is uncollectable based on quarterly analysis of credit risk. As of January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 326 Credit Losses . The amount of the ACL is based upon a loss rate model that considers multiple factors which reflects management s assessment of the credit quality of the loan portfolio. Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The factors are both quantitative and qualitative in nature including, but not limited to, historical losses, economic conditions, trends in delinquencies, value and adequacy of underlying collateral, volume and portfolio mix, and internal loan processes.

Table of Contents 
 The quantitative allowance is calculated using a number of inputs and assumptions. The process and guidelines were developed using, among other factors, the guidance from federal banking regulatory agencies and GAAP. The results of this process, support management s assessment as to the adequacy of the ACL at each balance sheet date. The process for calculating the allowance for credit losses begins with our historical losses by portfolio segment. The losses are then incorporated into reasonable and supportable forecast to develop the quantitative component of the allowance for credit losses. In calculating the ACL, the Company specifies both the reasonable and supportable forecast and reversion periods in three economic conditions (expansion, transition, contraction). During 2022, the Company made an adjustment to decrease the reversion period to adjust for the model using a more favorable forecast based on national statistics compared to the Bank s primary market area, the New York Tri-State area, where economic improvements lag behind the nation. When calculating the ACL estimate for December 31, 2022, the reasonable and supportable forecast was for a period of two quarters and the reversion period was four quarters. At December 31, 2022, the ACL for loans totaled 40.4 million. Non-performing loans totaled 32.4 million and 14.9 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Bank s underwriting standards generally require a loan-to-value ratio of no more than 75 at the time the loan is originated. At December 31, 2022, the outstanding principal balance of our non-performing loans was 36.0 of the estimated current value of the supporting collateral, after considering the charge-offs that have been recorded. We incurred total net charge-offs of 1.5 million and 3.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company recorded a provision (benefit) for credit losses on loans totaling 4.8 million and 4.9) million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The provision recorded in 2022 was primarily due to loan growth, increased reserves on specific credits, coupled with the ongoing economic uncertainty resulting from high and rising inflation including increasing interest rates. The benefit recorded in 2021 was primarily due to improving economic conditions. We believe that at December 31, 2022, the allowance was sufficient to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses represented 0.58 and 0.56 of gross loans outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The allowance for credit losses represented 124.9 and 248.7 of non-performing loans at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company modified one investment security totaling 21.0 million as TDR by granting a payment forbearance. The non-performing investment security and attendant loan are collateralized by a commercial condominium located in Manhattan with a combined LTV of approximately 63 . At December 31, 2022, this security is reported as non-accrual and non-performing. The ACL for held-to-maturity securities totaled 1.1 million and 0.9 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Our investment policy is designed primarily to manage the interest rate sensitivity of our overall assets and liabilities, to generate a favorable return without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk, to complement our lending activities and to provide and maintain liquidity. In establishing our investment strategies, we consider our business and growth strategies, the economic environment, our interest rate risk exposure, our interest rate sensitivity gap position, the types of securities to be held, and other factors. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Management Strategy in Item 7 of this Annual Report. Although we have authority to invest in various types of assets, we primarily invest in mortgage-backed securities, securities issued by mutual or bond funds that invest in government and government agency securities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds and collateralized loan obligations CLO ). We did not hold any issues of foreign sovereign debt on December 31, 2022, and 2021. Our ALCO Investment Committee meets quarterly to monitor investment transactions and to establish investment strategy. The Board of Directors reviews the investment policy on an annual basis and investment activity monthly.

Table of Contents 
 Investment securities are classified as available for sale when management intends to hold the securities for an indefinite period, or when the securities may be utilized for tactical asset/liability purposes and may be sold from time to time to effectively manage interest rate exposure and resultant prepayment risk and liquidity needs. Securities are classified as held-to-maturity when management intends to hold the securities until maturity. We carry some of our investments under the fair value option totaling 13.0 million and 14.6 million at December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Unrealized gains and losses for investments carried under the fair value option are included in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale, are excluded from earnings and included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes. Securities held-to-maturity are carried at their amortized cost basis. As of December 31, 2022, we had 735.4 million in available for sale securities and 73.7 million in held-to-maturity securities, together they represented 9.60 of total assets. Total securities had an aggregate market value that approximated 1.2 times the amount of our equity as of December 31, 2022. The Company s estimate of expected credit losses for held-to-maturity debt securities is based on historical information, current conditions, and a reasonable and supportable forecast. On December 31, 2022 the Company s held to maturity portfolio composition was four securities totaling 74.8 million (before allowance for credit losses). The first two are structured similar to a commercial owner occupied loan, and modeled for credit losses similarly to commercial business loans secured by real estate; the third is under forbearance and is individually evaluated for allowance for credit loss; and the fourth issued and guaranteed by Fannie Mae, which is a government sponsored enterprise that has a credit rating and perceived credit risk comparable to the U.S. government. Accordingly, the Company assumes a zero loss expectation from the Fannie Mae security. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company modified one investment security totaling 21.0 million as TDR by granting a payment forbearance. At December 31, 2022, this security is reported as non-accrual and non-performing.

 Mortgage-backed securities . At December 31, 2022, we had available for sale and held-to-maturity mortgage-backed securities with a market value totaling 391.3 million, of which 10.9 million was invested in adjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities. The mortgage loans underlying these adjustable-rate securities generally are subject to limitations on annual and lifetime interest rate increases. We anticipate that investments in mortgage-backed securities may continue to be used in the future to supplement mortgage-lending activities. Mortgage-backed securities are more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used more easily to collateralize our obligations, including collateralizing of the governmental deposits of the Bank. The following table sets forth our available for sale mortgage-backed securities purchases, sales and principal repayments for the years indicated:

 (1) Does not include allowance for credit losses totaling 1.1 million. Sources of Funds Gene ral . Deposits, FHLB-NY borrowings, other borrowings, principal and interest payments on loans, mortgage-backed and other securities, and proceeds from the sale of loans and securities are our primary sources of funds for lending, investing and other general purposes. De posits . We offer a variety of deposit accounts having a range of interest rates and terms. Our deposits primarily consist of savings accounts, money market accounts, demand accounts, NOW accounts and certificates of deposit. We have a relatively stable retail deposit base drawn from our market area through our 25 full-service offices and our Internet Branch. We seek to retain existing depositor relationships by offering quality service and competitive interest rates, while keeping deposit growth within reasonable limits. It is management s intention to balance its goal to maintain competitive interest rates on deposits while seeking to manage its cost of funds to finance its strategies. In addition to our full-service offices, we operate the Internet Branch and a government banking unit. The Internet Branch currently offers savings accounts, money market accounts, checking accounts, and certificates of deposit. This allows us to compete on a national scale without the geographical constraints of physical locations. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, total deposits at our Internet Branch were 154.6 million and 188.0 million, respectively. The government banking unit provides banking services to public municipalities, including counties, cities, towns, villages, school districts, libraries, fire districts, and the various courts throughout the New York City metropolitan area. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, total deposits in our government banking unit totaled 1,653.3 million and 1,618.8 million, respectively.

 Our core deposits, consisting of savings accounts, NOW accounts, money market accounts, and non-interest bearing demand accounts, are typically more stable and lower costing than other sources of funding. However, the flow of deposits into a particular type of account is significantly influenced by general economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, and competition. We experienced an increase in our due to depositors during 2022 of 103.7 million, primarily due to growth in our certificate of deposits, partially offset by a decline in core deposits. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the cost of our interest-bearing due to depositors accounts increased 50 basis points to 0.88 from 0.38 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the cost of deposits was primarily due to the Company s response to the Federal Reserve increasing rates. While we are unable to predict the direction of future interest rate changes, if interest rates would rise during 2023, the result could be an increase in our cost of deposits, which could reduce our net interest margin. Similarly, if interest rates decline in 2023, we could see a decline in our cost of deposits, which could increase our net interest margin. Included in deposits are certificates of deposit with balances of 250,000 or more (excluding brokered deposits issued in 1,000 amounts under a master certificate of deposit) was 377.4 million and 217.5 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We utilize brokered deposits as an additional funding source and to assist in the management of our interest rate risk. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had 856.3 million and 626.3 million, respectively, classified as brokered deposits. We obtained brokered certificates of deposit when the interest rate on these deposits is below the prevailing interest rate for non-brokered certificates of deposit with similar maturities in our market, or when obtaining them allowed us to extend the maturities of our deposits at favorable rates compared to borrowing funds with similar maturities, when we are seeking to extend the maturities of our funding to assist in the management of our interest rate risk. Brokered certificates of deposit provide funds for us at a lower operating cost as compared to non-brokered certificates of deposit since we only have one account to maintain versus several accounts with multiple interest and maturity checks. The Depository Trust Company DTC is used as the clearing house, maintaining each deposit under the name of CEDE Co. These deposits are transferable just like a stock or bond investment and the customer can open the account with only a phone call, just like buying a stock or bond. Unlike non-brokered certificates of deposit, where the deposit amount can be withdrawn with a penalty for any reason, including increasing interest rates, a brokered certificate of deposit can only be withdrawn in the event of the death, or court declared mental incompetence, of the depositor. These instruments allow us to better manage the maturity of our deposits and our interest rate risk. At times, we also utilize brokers to obtain money market deposits. The rate we pay on brokered money market accounts is similar to the rate we pay on non-brokered money market accounts, and the rate is agreed to in a contract between the Bank and the broker. These accounts are similar to brokered certificates of deposit accounts in that we only maintain one account for the total deposit per broker, with the broker maintaining the detailed records of each depositor. We also offer access to FDIC insurance coverage in excess of 250,000 through the IntraFi Network which arranges for the placement of funds into certificate of deposit accounts, demand accounts or money market accounts issued by other member banks within the network in increments of less than 250,000. This allows us to accept deposits in excess of 250,000 from a depositor and to place the deposits through the network to other member banks to provide full FDIC deposit insurance coverage. We may receive deposits from other member banks in exchange for the deposits we place into the network. We may also obtain deposits from other network member banks without placing deposits into the network. We obtain these types of deposits primarily as a short-term funding source. We can also place deposits with other member banks without receiving deposits from other member banks. Depositors are allowed to withdraw funds, with a penalty, from these accounts at one or more of the member banks that hold the deposits. Additionally, we place a portion of our government deposits in the IntraFi Network money market and demand accounts which does not require us to provide collateral. This allows us to invest our funds in higher yielding assets. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank held IntraFi Network money market and demand deposits totaling 654.2 million and 817.6 million, respectively, of which 55.0 million were classified as brokered deposits at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, none of these deposits were classified as brokered deposits.

Although deposits are our primary source of funds, we also use borrowings as an alternative and cost effective source of funds for lending, investing and other general purposes. The Bank is a member of, and is eligible to obtain advances from, the FHLB-NY. Such advances generally are secured by a blanket lien against the Bank s mortgage portfolio and the Bank s investment in the stock of the FHLB-NY. In addition, the Bank may pledge mortgage-backed securities to obtain advances from the FHLB-NY. See Regulation Federal Home Loan Bank System. The maximum amount that the FHLB-NY will advance fluctuates from time to time in accordance with the policies of the FHLB-NY. The Bank may enter into repurchase agreements with broker-dealers and the FHLB-NY. These agreements are recorded as financing transactions and the obligations to repurchase are reflected as a liability in our consolidated financial statements. The Bank also has unsecured lines of credit with other commercial banks. In addition, we issued junior subordinated debentures with a total par of 61.9 million in 2007. These junior subordinated debentures are carried at fair value in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition. In 2022 and 2021, the Company issued subordinated debt with aggregated principal amounts of 65.0 million and 125.0 million, respectively.

Omnibus Incentive Plan The 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan 2014 Omnibus Plan became effective on May 20, 2014 after adoption by the Board of Directors and approval by the stockholders. The 2014 Omnibus Plan authorizes the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee to grant a variety of equity compensation awards as well as long-term and annual cash incentive awards. To the extent that an award under the 2014 Omnibus Plan is 
 29 

Table of Contents 
 cancelled, expired, forfeited, settled in cash, settled by issuance of fewer shares than the number underlying the award, or otherwise terminated without delivery of shares to a participant in payment of the exercise price or taxes relating to an award, the shares retained by or returned to the Company will be available for future issuance under the 2014 Omnibus Plan. The 2014 Omnibus Plan originally covered the issuance of 1,100,000 shares, which was increased. On May 31, 2017, stockholders approved an amendment to the 2014 Omnibus Plan authorizing an additional 672,000 shares available for future issuance. In addition, that amendment eliminated, in the case of stock options and stock appreciation rights, the ability to recycle shares used to satisfy the exercise price or taxes for such awards. On May 18, 2021, stockholders approved a further amendment of the 2014 Omnibus Plan to authorize an additional 1,100,000 shares for future issuance. Including the additional shares authorized from the amendments, 968,657 shares remained available for future issuance under the 2014 Omnibus Plan at December 31, 2022. For additional information concerning this plan, see Note 12 Stock-Based Compensation of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report. REGULATION General The Bank is a New York State-chartered commercial bank and its deposit accounts are insured under the Deposit Insurance Fund (the DIF of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC up to applicable legal limits. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the New York State Department of Financial Services NYDFS ), as its chartering agency, by the FDIC, as its insurer of deposits, and to a lesser extent by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB ), which was created under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ). The Bank must file reports with the NYDFS, the FDIC, and the CFPB concerning its activities and financial condition, in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions. Furthermore, the Bank is periodically examined by the NYDFS and the FDIC to assess compliance with various regulatory requirements, including safety and soundness considerations. This regulation and supervision established a comprehensive framework of activities in which a commercial bank can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with its supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss allowances for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulation, whether by the NYDFS, the FDIC, or through legislation, could have a material adverse impact on the Company, the Bank and its operations, and the Company s shareholders. While the regulatory environment has entered a period of rebalancing of the post financial crisis framework, we expect that our business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision. The Company is required to file certain reports under, and otherwise comply with, the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (the FRB ), the FDIC, the NYDFS, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC under federal securities laws. In addition, the FRB periodically examines the Company. Certain of the regulatory requirements applicable to the Bank and the Company are referred to below or elsewhere herein. However, such discussion is not meant to be a complete explanation of all laws and regulations and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations. COVID-19 Legislation In March 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law in response to the coronavirus pandemic. This legislation aimed at providing relief for individuals and businesses that have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (the CAA was signed into law, providing for, among other things, further suspension of the exception for loan modifications to not be classified as TDRs if certain criteria are 
 30 

Table of Contents 
 met, as described below. The CARES Act, as amended by the CAA, includes a provision for the Company to opt out of applying the TDR accounting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ASC 310-40 for certain loan modifications. Loan modifications made between March 1, 2020, and the earlier of (i) January 2, 2022, or (ii) 60 days after the President declared a termination of the COVID-19 national emergency were eligible for this relief if the related loans were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019. Accordingly, this relief ended on January 2, 2022. As discussed below, the Company applied the guidance to qualifying loan modifications. The CARES Act includes the Paycheck Protection Program PPP ), a program to aid small and medium- sized businesses through federally guaranteed loans distributed through banks and other financial institutions. These loans were intended to guarantee eight weeks of payroll and other costs to help those businesses remain viable and allow their workers to pay their bills. Impact of COVID-19 Overview During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have actively assisted our customers by providing short-term forbearances in the form of deferrals of interest, principal and/or escrow for terms ranging from one to twelve months. At December 31, 2022, we had four active forbearances for loans with an aggregate outstanding loan balance of approximately 9.9 million resulting in total deferment of 0.6 million in principal, interest and escrow. We actively participated in the PPP, closing 5.2 million and 138.7 million of these loans during the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. We were one of nine banks in the State of New York that participated in the Main Street Lending Program. We were also a proud participant in the FHLB-NY Small Business Recovery Grant Program, helping our customers and communities navigate through the current environment. Impact on Our Financial Statements and Results of Operations Financial institutions are dependent upon the ability of their loan customers to meet their loan obligations and the availability of their workforce and vendors. Early in the second quarter of 2020, shelter-at-home mandates and other remediation from the COVID-19 pandemic were enacted. The pandemic and these remediation measures have directly impacted the communities we serve, where commercial activity decreased significantly. As of December 31, 2022, that commercial activity had improved and returned to pre-pandemic levels. In addition, the economic pressures and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in changes in consumer spending behaviors in the communities we serve, which impacted and may continue to impact the demand for loans and other services we offer. However, the Company s capital and financial resources have not been materially impacted by the pandemic, as our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income, which benefited from the actions taken by the Federal Reserve to counteract the negative economic impact of the pandemic. Future operating results and near-and-long-term financial condition are subject to significant uncertainty. Our funding sources have not changed significantly, and we expect to continue to be able to timely service our debts and its obligations. The Company elected to consider loans temporarily modified for borrowers directly impacted by COVID-19 not to be TDRs where CARES Act and/or CAA criteria were deemed to have been met. As such, these loans were considered current and continued to accrue interest on their original contractual terms.

 The Dodd-Frank Act The Dodd-Frank Act has significantly impacted the current bank regulatory structure and is expected to continue to affect, into the immediate future, the lending and investment activities and general operations of depository institutions and their holding companies. In addition to creating the CFPB, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the FRB to establish minimum consolidated capital requirements for bank holding companies that are as stringent as those required for insured depository institutions; the components of Tier 1 capital will be restricted to capital instruments that are currently considered to be Tier 1 capital for insured depository institutions. In addition, the proceeds of trust preferred securities will be excluded from Tier 1 capital unless (i) such securities are issued by bank holding companies with assets of less than 500 million, or (ii) such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010, by bank or savings and loan holding companies with assets of less than 15 billion. The Dodd-Frank Act created a new supervisory structure for oversight of the U.S. financial system, including the establishment of a new council of regulators, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, to monitor and address systemic risks to the financial system. Non-bank financial companies that are deemed to be significant to the stability of the U.S. financial system and all bank holding companies with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets will be subject to heightened supervision and regulation. The FRB will implement prudential requirements and prompt corrective action procedures for such companies. The Dodd-Frank Act made many additional changes in banking regulation, including: authorizing depository institutions, for the first time, to pay interest on business checking accounts; requiring originators of securitized loans to retain a percentage of the risk for transferred loans; establishing regulatory rate-setting for certain debit card interchange fees; and establishing a number of reforms for mortgage lending and consumer protection. The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments not to be based on deposits, but on the average consolidated total assets less the tangible equity capital of an insured institution. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions, and credit unions to 250,000 per depositor, per FDIC insured bank, per ownership category. Basel III The Company and the Bank are subject to a comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations that was issued by the FDIC and FRB in July 2013 (the Basel III Capital Rules ), subject to phase-in periods for certain components and other provisions. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios are: 4.5 Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 to risk-weighted assets; 6.0 Tier 1 capital that is CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets; 8.0 Total Capital that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and 4.0 Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the leverage ratio ). 
 The Basel III Capital Rules also introduced a capital conservation buffer, composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The Bank s capital conservation buffer currently is 6.37 . Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets below the effective minimum (4.5 plus the capital conservation buffer) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. As of December 31, 2022, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules. Together with the FDIC, the Federal Reserve has issued proposed rules that would simplify the capital treatment of certain capital deductions and adjustments, and the final phase-in period for these capital deductions and adjustments has been indefinitely delayed. In addition, in December 2018, the federal banking agencies finalized rules that would permit bank holding companies and banks to phase-in, for regulatory capital purposes, the day-one impact of the new current expected credit loss accounting rule on retained earnings over a period of three years.

 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the Economic Growth Act provides certain regulatory relief, including to community banks, which are generally characterized in the statute as banking organizations with less than 10 billion in total consolidated assets and with limited trading activities. The Economic Growth Act requires the federal banking agencies to develop a community bank leverage ratio (the ratio of a bank s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for financial institutions with assets of less than 10 billion. A financial institution can elect to be subject to this new definition. The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have issued a rule pursuant to the Economic Growth Act to establish for institutions with assets of less than 10 billion a community bank leverage ratio (the ratio of a bank s tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets) of 9 that such institutions may elect to use in lieu of the generally applicable leverage and risk-based capital requirements under Basel III. The Bank has elected not to be subject to this new definition. See FDIC Regulations Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. The Truth in Lending Act TILA is the commonly used name for Title I of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, passed by Congress in 1968, which is the consumer protection law specifying what information lenders must share with borrowers before giving them a loan or line of credit. This information includes the annual percentage rate, loan terms, and total cost of the loan. Section 101 of the Economic Growth Act amended the TILA to add a safe harbor for plain vanilla mortgage loans originated by banking organizations and credit unions with less than 10 billion in total consolidated assets under existing qualified mortgage and ability to pay rules. Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule, generally prohibits insured depository institutions and any company affiliated with an insured depository institution from engaging in proprietary trading and from acquiring or retaining ownership interests in, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with a hedge fund or private equity fund. Under the Economic Growth Act, community banks, (which for this purpose are generally characterized in the statute as banking organizations with less than 10 billion in total consolidated assets with limited trading activities), are exempt from the Volcker Rule and its proprietary trading prohibitions. New York State Law The Bank derives its lending, investment, and other authority primarily from the applicable provisions of New York State Banking Law and the regulations of the NYDFS, as limited by FDIC regulations. Under these laws and regulations, banks, including the Bank, may invest in real estate mortgages, consumer and commercial loans, certain types of debt securities (including certain corporate debt securities, and obligations of federal, state, and local governments and agencies), certain types of corporate equity securities, and certain other assets. The lending powers of New York State-chartered commercial banks are not subject to percentage-of-assets or capital limitations, although there are limits applicable to loans to individual borrowers. The exercise by an FDIC-insured commercial bank of the lending and investment powers under New York State Banking Law is limited by FDIC regulations and other federal laws and regulations. In particular, the applicable provisions of New York State Banking Law and regulations governing the investment authority and activities of an FDIC-insured state-chartered savings bank and commercial bank have been effectively limited by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 FDICIA and the FDIC regulations issued pursuant thereto. With certain limited exceptions, a New York State-chartered commercial bank may not make loans or extend credit for commercial, corporate, or business purposes (including lease financing) to a single borrower, or related group of borrowers, the aggregate amount of which would exceed 15 of the bank s net worth. An additional amount may be loaned up to an additional 10 of the bank s net worth, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which is defined to include certain financial instruments, but generally does not include real estate. The Bank currently complies with all applicable loans-to-one-borrower limitations. At December 31, 2022, the Bank s largest aggregate amount of outstanding loans to one borrower was 109.4 million, all of which were performing according to their terms. See General Lending Activities. Under New York State Banking Law, New York State-chartered stock-form commercial banks may declare and pay dividends out of its net profits, unless there is an impairment of capital, but approval of the NYDFS Superintendent (the Superintendent is required if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in a calendar year would exceed the 
 33 

Table of Contents 
 total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years less prior dividends paid. New York State Banking Law gives the Superintendent authority to issue an order to a New York State-chartered banking institution to appear and explain an apparent violation of law, to discontinue unauthorized or unsafe practices, and to keep prescribed books and accounts. Upon a finding by the NYDFS that any director, trustee, or officer of any banking organization has violated any law or has continued unauthorized or unsafe practices in conducting the business of the banking organization after having been notified by the Superintendent to discontinue such practices, such director, trustee, or officer may be removed from office after notice and opportunity to be heard. The Superintendent also has authority to appoint a conservator or a receiver for a savings or commercial bank under certain circumstances. The Superintendent of the NYDFS has the authority to appoint a receiver or liquidator of any state-chartered bank or trust company under specified circumstances, including where (i) the bank is conducting its business in an unauthorized or unsafe manner, (ii) the bank has suspended payment of its obligations, or (iii) the bank cannot with safety and expediency continue to do business. The NYDFS has issued cybersecurity regulations in Part 500 of Title 23 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations Part 500 ), which cover five basic areas. Governance: The regulation requires senior management and boards of directors to adopt a cybersecurity policy for protecting information systems and most sensitive information. Covered companies are also required to designate a Chief Information Security Officer (the CISO ), who must report to the board annually. Testing: The regulation requires the conduct of cybersecurity tests and analyses, including a risk assessment to evaluate and categorize risks, evaluate the integrity and confidentiality of information systems and non-public information, and develop a process to mitigate any identified risks. Ongoing Requirements: The regulation imposes substantial day-to-day and technical requirements. Among others, we are required to develop and/or maintain access controls for our information systems, ensure the physical security of our computer systems, encrypt or protect personally identifiable information, perform reviews of in-house and externally created applications, train employees, and build an audit trail system. Vendors: The regulation also regulates third-party vendors with access to our information technology or non-public information. We are required to develop and implement written policies and procedures to ensure the security of our information technology systems or non-public information that can be accessed by our vendors, including identifying the risks from third-party access, imposing minimum cybersecurity practices for vendors, and creating a due-diligence process for evaluating those vendors. Reports: The regulation imposes a notification process for any material cybersecurity event. Within 72 hours, a cybersecurity event that has a reasonable likelihood of materially harming us or that must be reported to another government or self-regulating agency must be reported to the NYDFS. In addition, an annual compliance certification to the NYDFS from either the board or a senior officer is required. On November 9, 2022, the NYDFS released proposed amendments to Part 500 that covered entities would be required to notify the NYDFS within 72 hours of (i) any cybersecurity event that has a reasonable likelihood of disrupting or degrading any part of a company s normal operations, (ii) any unauthorized access to a privileged account or deployment of ransomware within a material part of the company s information systems, and (iii) any cybersecurity event at a third party service provider that affects a covered entity. In addition, covered entities would be required to notify the NYDFS within 24 hours of an extortion payment made in connection with a cybersecurity event involving the covered entity. Also, within 90 days of a cybersecurity event, covered entities would be required to provide the NYDFS of information requested by the NYDFS regarding the investigation of the cybersecurity event and a continuing obligation to update and supplement the information provided. The proposed amendments would also create a new category of Class A companies that would be subject to certain heightened requirements, including at least annually to conduct an independent external audit of their cybersecurity 
 34 

Table of Contents 
 programs, and, at least once every three years, use external experts to conduct a risk assessment. Also, the proposed amendments would require the senior governance bodies (the Board or a Committee thereof), the CISO and highest-ranking executive to take additional actions and reports and create new requirements with respect to cybersecurity policies and procedures, reports to the NYDFS, and specify what could be violations of Part 500 and the consequences for such violations. U.S Patriot Act and Money Laundering The Bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act BSA ), which incorporates several laws, including the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the USA PATRIOT Act and related regulations. The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government powers to address money laundering and terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the BSA, Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act implemented measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain provisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act. Among other things, Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act and the related regulations require: Establishment of anti-money laundering compliance programs that include policies, procedures, and internal controls; the designation of a BSA officer; a training program; and independent testing; Filing of certain reports to Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and law enforcement that are designated to assist in the detection and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing activities; Establishment of a program specifying procedures for obtaining and maintaining certain records from customers seeking to open new accounts, including verifying the identity of customers; In certain circumstances, compliance with enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money-laundering, terrorist financing and other suspicious activity; Monitoring account activity for suspicious transactions; and A heightened level of review for certain high-risk customers or accounts. 
 The USA PATRIOT Act also includes prohibitions on correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks and requires compliance with record keeping obligations with respect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks. The bank regulatory agencies have increased the regulatory scrutiny of the BSA and anti-money laundering programs maintained by financial institutions. Significant penalties and fines, as well as other supervisory orders may be imposed on a financial institution for non-compliance with these requirements. In addition, for financial institutions engaging in a merger transaction, federal bank regulatory agencies must consider the effectiveness of the financial institution s efforts to combat money laundering activities. The Bank has adopted policies and procedures to comply with these requirements. FDIC Regulations Capital Requirements. The FDIC has adopted risk-based capital guidelines to which the Bank is subject. The guidelines establish a systematic analytical framework that makes regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations. The Bank is required to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital in relation to regulatory risk-weighted assets. The ratio of such regulatory capital to regulatory risk-weighted assets is referred to as a risk-based capital ratio. Risk-based capital ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance- 
 35 

Table of Contents 
 sheet items to risk-weighted categories ranging from 0 to 1250 , with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk. These guidelines divide an institution s capital into two tiers. The first tier Tier 1 includes common equity, retained earnings, certain non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (excluding auction rate issues), and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and other intangible assets (except mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships subject to certain limitations). Supplementary Tier 2 capital includes, among other items, cumulative perpetual and long-term limited-life preferred stock, mandatorily convertible securities, certain hybrid capital instruments, term subordinated debt, and the ACL, subject to certain limitations, and up to 45 of pre-tax net unrealized gains on equity securities with readily determinable fair market values, less required deductions. See Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action below. The regulatory capital regulations of the FDIC and other federal banking agencies provide that the agencies will take into account the exposure of an institution s capital and economic value to changes in interest rate risk in assessing capital adequacy. According to such agencies, applicable considerations include the quality of the institution s interest rate risk management process, overall financial condition, and the level of other risks at the institution for which capital is needed. Institutions with significant interest rate risk may be required to hold additional capital. The agencies have issued a joint policy statement providing guidance on interest rate risk management, including a discussion of the critical factors affecting the agencies evaluation of interest rate risk in connection with capital adequacy. Institutions that engage in specified amounts of trading activity may be subject to adjustments in the calculation of the risk-based capital requirement to assure sufficient additional capital to support market risk. Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe, for the depository institutions under its jurisdiction, standards that relate to, among other things, internal controls; information and audit systems; loan documentation; credit underwriting; the monitoring of interest rate risk; asset growth; compensation; fees and benefits; and such other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness (the Guidelines to implement these safety and soundness standards. The Guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the Guidelines, the agency may require the institution to provide it with an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard, as required by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended, (the FDI Act ). The regulations establish deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans. Real Estate Lending Standards. The FDIC and the other federal banking agencies have adopted regulations that prescribe standards for extensions of credit that are (i) secured by real estate, or (ii) made for the purpose of financing construction or improvements on real estate. The FDIC regulations require each institution to establish and maintain written internal real estate lending standards that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices, and appropriate to the size of the institution and the nature and scope of its real estate lending activities. The standards also must be consistent with accompanying FDIC guidelines. The institution s standards establish requirements for loan portfolio diversification, prudent underwriting (including loan-to-value limits) that are clear and measurable, loan administration procedures, documentation, approval and reporting requirements. The real estate lending policies must reflect consideration of the federal bank regulators Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate Lending Policies. Institutions are also permitted to make a limited amount of loans that do not conform to the proposed loan-to-value limitations so long as such exceptions are reviewed and justified appropriately. The FDIC guidelines also list a number of lending situations in which exceptions to the loan-to-value standard are justified. The FDIC and the FRB have also jointly issued the Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices (the CRE Guidance ). The CRE Guidance, which addresses land development, construction, and certain multi-family loans, as well as commercial real estate loans, does not establish specific lending limits but rather reinforces and enhances these agencies existing regulations and guidelines for such lending and portfolio management. Specifically, the CRE Guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in lending if (1) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100 or more of total risk-based capital; or (2) total reported loans secured by multi-family properties, non-farm non-residential properties (excluding those that are owner-occupied), and loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 300 or more of total risk-based capital and the bank s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50 or more during the prior 36 months. If a concentration is 
 36 

Table of Contents 
 present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address key elements, including board and management oversight, strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, along with maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending. Dividend Limitations . The FDIC has authority to use its enforcement powers to prohibit a commercial bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Federal law prohibits the payment of dividends that will result in the institution failing to meet applicable capital requirements on a pro forma basis. The Bank is also subject to dividend declaration restrictions imposed by New York State law as previously discussed under New York State Law. Investment Activities . Since the enactment of FDICIA, all state-chartered financial institutions, including commercial banks and their subsidiaries, have generally been limited to such activities as principal and equity investments of the type, and in the amount, authorized for national banks. State law, FDICIA, and FDIC regulations permit certain exceptions to these limitations. In addition, the FDIC is authorized to permit institutions to engage in state-authorized activities or investments not permitted for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) for institutions that meet all applicable capital requirements if it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the FDIC insurance fund. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the GLBA and FDIC regulations impose certain quantitative and qualitative restrictions on such activities and on a bank s dealings with a subsidiary that engages in specified activities. Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take prompt corrective action with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For such purposes, the law establishes five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. Under current FDIC regulations, a bank is deemed to be well capitalized if the bank has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10 or greater, has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8 or greater, has a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5 or greater, has a leverage ratio of 5 or greater, and is not subject to any order or final capital directive by the FDIC to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. A bank may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it received an unsatisfactory safety and soundness examination rating. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank was a well-capitalized bank, as applicably defined. The Dodd-Frank Act made permanent the standard maximum amount of FDIC deposit insurance at 250,000 per depositor. In addition, the deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF. In this regard, insured depository institutions are required to pay quarterly deposit insurance assessments to the DIF. Under the FDIC s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based upon supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital level, and certain other factors, with less risky institutions paying lower assessments based on the assigned risk levels. An institution s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned and certain other factors. Assessment rates range from 1.5 to 40 basis points of the institution s assessment base, which is calculated as average total assets minus average tangible equity. Enforcement. Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, or condition imposed by the FDIC. The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority to correct unsafe or unsound practices and violations of law or regulation. Such authority includes the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, assessment of civil money penalties and removal of officers and directors. The FDIC may also appoint a conservator or receiver for a non-member bank under specified circumstances, such as where (i) the bank s assets are less than its obligations to creditors, (ii) the bank is likely to be unable to pay its obligations or meet depositors demands in the normal course of business, or (iii) a substantial dissipation of bank assets or earnings has occurred due to a violation of law of regulation or unsafe or unsound practices. Management does not know of any practice, condition, or violation that would lead to termination of the deposit insurance for the Bank. Brokered Deposits FDIC and other regulations generally limit the ability of an insured depository institution to accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless the institution s capital category is well capitalized or, with the FDIC s approval,

 adequately capitalized. Pursuant to the regulations the Bank, as a well-capitalized institution, may accept brokered deposits. Incentive Compensation Guidance Federal banking agencies and the NYDFS have issued comprehensive guidance intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations, including bank holding companies, do not undermine the safety and soundness of those organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The incentive compensation guidance sets expectations for banking organizations concerning their incentive compensation arrangements and related risk-management, control and governance processes. In addition, in October 2022, the SEC finalized a rule that directs stock exchanges to require listed companies to implement claw-back policies to recover incentive-based compensation from current or former executive officers in the event of certain financial restatements and requires companies to disclose their claw-back policies and their actions under those policies. Transactions with Affiliates Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and FRB s Regulation W generally: Limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any affiliate; limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with all affiliates; and require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least favorable to, the bank or subsidiary, as those provided to a non-affiliate. 
 An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the bank. The term covered transaction includes the making of loans to the affiliate, the purchase of assets from the affiliate, the issuance of a guarantee on behalf of the affiliate, the purchase of securities issued by the affiliate, and other similar types of transactions. A bank s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and greater than 10 percent shareholders, as well as entities controlled by such persons, is subject to Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O promulgated thereunder by the FRB. Among other things, these loans must be made on terms (including interest rates charged and collateral required) substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals or be made as part of a benefit or compensation program and on terms widely available to employees and must not involve a greater than normal risk of repayment. In addition, the amount of loans a bank may make to these persons is based, in part, on the bank s capital position, and specified approval procedures must be followed in making loans which exceed specified amounts. Community Reinvestment Act Federal Regulation. Under the Community Reinvestment Act CRA ), as implemented by FDIC regulations, an institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions, nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the FDIC, in connection with its examinations, to assess the institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution. The CRA requires public disclosure of an institution s CRA rating and further requires the FDIC to provide a written evaluation of an institution s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. The Bank received a CRA rating of Outstanding in its most recent completed CRA examination, the report for which was prepared as of July 9, 2021 and approved by the FDIC on April 7, 2022. In June 2022, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC issued a proposal to amend their regulations implementing the CRA. The proposed rules would materially revise the current CRA framework, including new assessment area requirements, new methods of calculating credit for lending, investment, and service activities, and 
 38 

Table of Contents 
 additional data collection and reporting requirements, including an increase in the thresholds for receiving Outstanding ratings in the future. New York State Regulation. The Bank is also subject to provisions of the New York State Banking Law that impose continuing and affirmative obligations upon a banking institution organized in New York State to serve the credit needs of its local community (the NYCRA ). Such obligations are substantially similar to those imposed by the CRA. The NYCRA requires the NYDFS to make a periodic written assessment of an institution s compliance with the NYCRA, utilizing a four-tiered rating system, and to make such assessment available to the public. The NYCRA also requires the Superintendent to consider the NYCRA rating when reviewing an application to engage in certain transactions, including mergers, asset purchases, and the establishment of branch offices or ATMs, and provides that such assessment may serve as a basis for the denial of any such application. Federal Home Loan Bank System The Bank is a member of the FHLB-NY, one of 11 regional FHLBs comprising the FHLB system. Each regional FHLB manages its customer relationships, while the 11 FHLBs use its combined size and strength to obtain its necessary funding at the lowest possible cost. As a member of the FHLB-NY, the Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of FHLB-NY capital stock. Pursuant to this requirement, at December 31, 2022, the Bank was required to maintain 45.8 million of FHLB-NY stock. Holding Company Regulations The Company is subject to examination, regulation, and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHCA ), as administered by the FRB. The Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Prior FRB approval would be required for the Company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after giving effect to such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5 of any class of voting shares of such bank or bank holding company. In addition, before any bank acquisition can be completed, prior approval thereof may also be required to be obtained from other agencies having supervisory jurisdiction over the bank to be acquired, including the NYDFS. FRB regulations generally prohibit a bank holding company from engaging in, or acquiring, direct or indirect control of more than 5 of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the FRB to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling Bank as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the FRB has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking are: (i) making or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing discount brokerage services; (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment, or financial advisor; (v) leasing personal or real property; (vi) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (vii) acquiring a savings and loan association. The FRB has adopted capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies (on a consolidated basis). The Dodd-Frank Act required the FRB to issue consolidated regulatory capital requirements for bank holding companies that are at least as stringent as those applicable to insured depository institutions. Such regulations eliminated the use of certain instruments, such as cumulative preferred stock and trust preferred securities, as Tier 1 holding company capital. At December 31, 2022, the Company s consolidated capital exceeded these requirements. Bank holding companies are generally required to give the FRB prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding twelve months, is equal to 10 or more of the Company s consolidated net worth. The FRB may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, FRB order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the FRB. The FRB has adopted an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions.

 The FRB has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the FRB s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. The FRB s policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity, and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. The Dodd-Frank Act codifies the source of financial strength policy and requires regulations to facilitate its application. Under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions. Under the FDI Act, a depository institution may be liable to the FDIC for losses caused to the DIF if a commonly controlled depository institution were to fail. The Bank is commonly controlled within the meaning of that law. The status of the Company as a registered bank holding company under the BHCA does not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws. The Company, the Bank, and their respective affiliates will be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of various agencies of the United States Government, including the Federal Reserve System. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, it is difficult for management to accurately predict future changes in monetary policy or the effect of such changes on the business or financial condition of the Company or the Bank. Acquisition of the Holding Company Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act CIBCA ), a notice must be submitted to the FRB if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire 10 or more of the Company s shares of outstanding common stock, unless the FRB has found that the acquisition will not result in a change in control of the Company. Under the CIBCA, the FRB generally has 60 days within which to act on such notices, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer; the convenience and needs of the communities served by the Company and the Bank; and the anti-trust effects of the acquisition. Under the BHCA, any company would be required to obtain approval from the FRB before it may obtain control of the Company within the meaning of the BHCA. Control generally is defined to mean the ownership or power to vote 25 or more of any class of voting securities of the Company or the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of the Company s directors. An existing bank holding company would, under the BHCA, be required to obtain the FRB s approval before acquiring more than 5 of the Company s voting stock. In addition to the CIBCA and the BHCA, New York State Banking Law generally requires prior approval of the New York State Banking Board before any action is taken that causes any company to acquire direct or indirect control of a banking institution that is organized in New York. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Created under the Dodd-Frank Act, and given extensive implementation and enforcement powers, the CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that (1) materially interfere with a consumer s ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service, or (2) take unreasonable advantage of a consumer s (a) lack of financial savvy, (b) inability to protect himself or herself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services, or (c) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer s interests. The CFPB has the authority to investigate possible violations of federal consumer financial law, hold hearings and commence civil litigation. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws. The CFPB may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or an injunction.

 Mortgage Banking and Related Consumer Protection Regulations The retail activities of the Bank, including lending and the acceptance of deposits, are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Loan operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as: The federal Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z issued by the FRB, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C issued by the FRB, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; The Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B issued by the FRB, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; The Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V issued by the FRB, governing the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies; The Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and The guidance of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws. 
 Deposit operations also are subject to: The Truth in Savings Act and Regulation DD issued by the FRB, which requires disclosure of deposit terms to consumers; Regulation CC issued by the FRB, which relates to the availability of deposit funds to consumers; The Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain the confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; and The Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E issued by the FRB, which governs automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services. 
 In addition, the Bank and its subsidiaries may also be subject to certain state laws and regulations designed to protect consumers. Many of the foregoing laws and regulations are subject to change resulting from the provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act, which in many cases calls for revisions to implementing regulations. In addition, oversight responsibilities of these and other consumer protection laws and regulations will, in large measure, transfer from the Bank s primary regulators to the CFPB. We cannot predict the effect that being regulated by a new, additional regulatory authority focused on consumer financial protection, or any new implementing regulations or revisions to existing regulations that may result from the establishment of this new authority, will have on our businesses. Data Privacy Federal and state laws contain extensive consumer privacy protection provisions. The GLBA requires financial institutions to periodically disclose their privacy practices and policies relating to sharing such information and enable 
 41 

Table of Contents 
 retail customers to opt out of the Bank s ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. The GLBA also requires financial institutions to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information. Cybersecurity The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (the CISA is intended to improve cybersecurity in the U.S. through sharing of information about security threats between the U.S. government and private sector organizations, including financial institutions such as the Bank. The CISA also authorizes companies to monitor their own systems, notwithstanding any other provision of law, and allows companies to carry out defensive measures on their own systems from potential cyber-attacks. In addition, effective April 2022, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC issued a rule that, among other things, requires a banking organization to notify its primary federal regulators within 36 hours after identifying a computer-security incident that the banking organization believes in good faith could materially disrupt, degrade or impair its business or operations in a manner that would, among other things, jeopardize the viability of its operations, result in customers being unable to access their deposit and other accounts, result in a material loss of revenue, profit or franchise value, or pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States. Federal Restrictions on Acquisition of the Company Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the FRB if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire 10 or more of the Company s shares of outstanding common stock, unless the FRB has found that the acquisition will not result in a change in control of the Company. Federal Securities Laws The Company s common stock is registered with the SEC and listed for trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq ). Accordingly, the Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules of Nasdaq. In August 2021, the SEC approved new Nasdaq listing rules regarding board diversity and disclosure. Beginning with the Company s proxy statement for its annual meeting of shareholders in 2022, the Company will commence disclosing board diversity data annually. In addition, under new Nasdaq listing rules, the Company will be required to have, or explain why it does not have, (i) one diverse director by the later of August 6, 2023, or the date it files its proxy statement for its annual meeting shareholders in 2023, and (ii) two diverse directors by the later of August 6, 2025, or the date it files its proxy statement for its annual meeting of shareholders in 2025. A listed issuer may meet these diversity requirements by having two female directors or one female director and one director who is an underrepresented minority or LGBTQ+. The Company presently meets these requirements. Available Information We are a reporting company and file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors. In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report, the following factors and other considerations should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business. Changes in Interest Rates May Impact Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations Our primary source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income generated by our interest-earning assets (consisting primarily of multi-family residential loans, commercial business loans and commercial real estate mortgage loans) and the interest expense paid on our interest-bearing liabilities (consisting primarily of deposits and borrowings). The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities, along with the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by such external factors as the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board (the FOMC ), and market interest rates. The FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate seven times during 2022 from a range of 0.25 to 0.50 in March to a range of 4.25 to 4.50 in December. The FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate an additional 25 basis points in February of 2023 to 4.50 to 4.75 , and it is currently expected that during the remainder of 2023 the FOMC may increase the target range for federal funds rate several more times. There can be no assurances as to any future FOMC decisions on interest rates. A significant portion of our loans have fixed interest rates (or, if adjustable, are initially fixed for periods of five to 10 years) and longer terms than our deposits and borrowings. Our net interest income could be adversely affected if the rates we pay on deposits and borrowings increase more rapidly than the rates we earn on loans. Our interest rate risk is exacerbated in the short term by the fact that approximately 67 of our certificates of deposit accounts and borrowings will reprice or mature during the next year. As a result of our historical focus on the origination of multi-family residential mortgage loans, commercial business loans and commercial real estate mortgage loans, the majority of our loans are adjustable rate, however, many adjust at periods of five to 10 years. In addition, a large percentage of our investment securities and mortgage-backed securities have fixed interest rates and are classified as available for sale. As is the case with many financial institutions, our emphasis on increasing the generation of core deposits, those with no stated maturity date, has resulted in our interest-bearing liabilities having a shorter duration than our interest-earning assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility because interest rates change over time and during the first quarter of 2022 were at historical low levels. As interest rates increase, our cost of funds increases more rapidly than the yields on a substantial portion of our interest-earning assets. In addition, the estimated fair value of our fixed-rate assets, such as our securities portfolios, would decline (and our unrealized gains on such assets would ordinarily decrease and unrealized losses would ordinarily increase) if interest rates increase, all as occurred in 2022 and could continue to occur in 2023. However, the derivative portfolio increases in fair value as interest rates increase, partially mitigating the effects of the securities portfolio. In line with the foregoing, we have experienced and may continue to experience an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities primarily due to raising the rates we pay on some of our deposit products to stay competitive within our market and an increase in borrowing costs from increases in the federal funds rate. Prevailing interest rates also affect the extent to which borrowers repay and refinance loans. In a declining interest rate environment, the number of loan prepayments and loan refinancing may increase, as well as prepayments of mortgage-backed securities. Call provisions associated with our investment in U.S. government agency and corporate securities may also adversely affect yield in a declining interest rate environment. Such prepayments and calls may adversely affect the yield of our loan and securities portfolios as we reinvest the prepaid funds in a lower interest rate environment. However, we typically receive additional loan fees when existing loans are refinanced, which partially offset the reduced yield on our loan portfolio resulting from prepayments. In periods of low interest rates, our level of core deposits also may decline if depositors seek higher-yielding instruments or other investments not offered by us, which in turn may increase our cost of funds and decrease our net interest margin to the extent alternative funding sources are utilized. An increasing interest rate environment would tend to extend the average lives of lower yielding fixed rate mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, which could adversely affect net interest income. Also, in an increasing interest rate environment, mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities may prepay at slower rates than experienced in the past, which could result in a reduction of prepayment penalty income. In addition, depositors tend to open longer term, higher costing certificate of deposit accounts which could adversely affect our net interest income if rates were to subsequently decline. Additionally, adjustable-rate mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities generally contain interim and 
 43

 lifetime caps that limit the amount the interest rate can increase or decrease at repricing dates. Significant increases in prevailing interest rates may significantly affect demand for loans and the value of the Bank s collateral. See Local Economic Conditions. Our Lending Activities Involve Risks that May Be Exacerbated Depending on the Mix of Loan Types At December 31, 2022, our gross loan portfolio was 6,925.8 million, of which 77.7 was mortgage loans secured by real estate. The majority of these real estate loans were secured by multi-family residential property 2,601.4 million), commercial real estate property 1,913.0 million) and one-to-four family mixed-use property 554.3 million), which combined represent 73.2 of our loan portfolio. Our loan portfolio is concentrated in the New York City metropolitan area. Multi-family residential, one-to-four family mixed-use property, commercial real estate mortgage loans, commercial business loans and construction loans, are generally viewed as exposing the lender to a greater risk of loss than fully underwritten one-to-four family residential mortgage loans and typically involve higher principal amounts per loan. Multi-family residential, one-to-four family mixed-use property and commercial real estate mortgage loans are typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related property, which is usually owned by a legal entity with the property being the entity s only asset. If the cash flow from the property is reduced, the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. If the borrower defaults, our only remedy may be to foreclose on the property, for which the market value may be less than the balance due on the related mortgage loan. We attempt to mitigate this risk by generally requiring a loan-to-value ratio of no more than 75 at a time the loan is originated, except for one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, where we require a loan-to value ratio of no more than 80 . Repayment of construction loans is contingent upon the successful completion and operation of the project. The repayment of commercial business loans (the increased origination of which is part of management s strategy), is contingent on the successful operation of the related business. Changes in local economic conditions and government regulations, which are outside the control of the borrower or lender, also could affect the value of the security for the loan or the future cash flow of the affected properties. We continually review the composition of our mortgage loan portfolio to manage the risk in the portfolio. COVID-19 and Other Adverse External Events The Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, us, our customers, employees and third-party service providers. During 2022 most employees of the Company worked three days in the office and two days remotely from home, and in the last quarter of 2022 these employees worked four days in the office and one day remotely. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to adversely affect us will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be predicted with certainty and many of which are outside of our control. These future developments may include the continued scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of new variants of COVID-19, the possibility of future resurgences of the COVID-19 pandemic, the continued effectiveness of the Company s business continuity plan including work-from-home arrangements and staffing at branches and certain other facilities, the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company s customers, employees, third-party service providers, as well as on other market participants, actions taken, or that may yet be taken, by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The financial markets have rebounded from the significant declines that occurred earlier in the pandemic and global economic conditions improved in 2021. However, the financial markets declined substantially in 2022 as the FOMC raised interest rates substantially to respond to high inflation (see above), many of the circumstances that arose or became more pronounced after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic persisted. Those circumstances include: volatility in financial and capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates; heightened cybersecurity, information security, and operational risks as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption resulting from the pandemic given increased online and remote activity, including as a result of work-from-home arrangements, all of which could disrupt our business; decreased demands for our products and services. The continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, military conflicts such as Russia s invasion of Ukraine, terrorism and other detrimental or destabilizing global and national events on general economic and market conditions, consumer and corporate spending and investment and borrowing patterns, there is a risk that adverse conditions could occur. These adverse conditions include, but are not limited to, increased cyber attacks; supply chain disruptions; higher inflation; decreased demand for the our products and services or those of our borrowers, which could increase credit risk;

 challenges related to maintaining sufficient qualified personnel due to labor shortages, talent attrition, willingness to return to work; and disruptions to business operations at the Company and at counterparties, vendors and other service providers. Even after such events fully subside, the U.S. economy may experience a prolonged economic slowdown or recession, and we anticipate that our operations would be materially and adversely affected by a prolonged economic slowdown or recession. To the extent that pandemics, acts of war, or terrorism and other detrimental external events adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital, loans, asset quality or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Risk Factors section of this Form 10-K. Failure to Effectively Manage Our Liquidity Could Significantly Impact Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations Our liquidity is critical to our ability to operate our business. Our primary sources of liquidity are deposits, both retail deposits from our branch network including our Internet Branch and brokered deposits, as well as borrowed funds, primarily wholesale borrowing from the FHLB-NY. Additionally, we have unsecured lines of credit with other commercial banks. Funds are also provided by the repayment and sale of securities and loans. Our ability to obtain funds are influenced by many external factors, including but not limited to, local, regional and national economic conditions, the direction of interest rates and competition for deposits in the markets we serve. Additionally, changes in the FHLB-NY underwriting guidelines may limit or restrict our ability to borrow effectively. A decline in available funding caused by any of the above factors could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, or fulfill our obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands. Our Ability to Obtain Brokered Deposits as an Additional Funding Source Could be Limited We utilize brokered deposits as an additional funding source and to assist in the management of our interest rate risk. The Bank had 856.3 million or 13.2 of total deposits and 626.3 million, or 9.8 of total deposits, in brokered deposit accounts at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We have obtained brokered certificates of deposit when the interest rate on these deposits is below the prevailing interest rate for non-brokered certificates of deposit with similar maturities in our market, or when obtaining them allowed us to extend the maturities of our deposits at favorable rates compared to borrowing funds with similar maturities, when we are seeking to extend the maturities of our funding to assist in the management of our interest rate risk. Brokered certificates of deposit provide a large deposit for us at a lower operating cost as compared to non-brokered certificates of deposit since we only have one account to maintain versus several accounts with multiple maturity checks. Unlike non-brokered certificates of deposit where the deposit amount can be withdrawn with a penalty for any reason, including increasing interest rates, a brokered certificate of deposit can only be withdrawn in the event of the death or court declared mental incompetence of the depositor. This allows us to better manage the maturity of our deposits and our interest rate risk. We also at times utilize brokers to obtain money market account deposits. The rate we pay on brokered money market accounts is similar to the rate we pay on non-brokered money market accounts, and the rate is agreed to in a contract between the Bank and the broker. These accounts are similar to brokered certificates of deposit accounts in that we only maintain one account for the total deposit per broker, with the broker maintaining the detailed records of each depositor. Additionally, we place a portion of our government deposits in the IntraFi Network money market or demand product, allowing us to invest our funds in higher yielding assets without providing collateral. As of December 31, 2022, total deposit balances include brokered deposits of money market deposits of 329.0 million, certificates of deposits of 446.8 million, and NOW deposits of 80.4 million. For December 31, 2021, total deposit balances include brokered deposits of money market deposits of 251.1 million, certificates of deposits of 196.2 million, and NOW deposits of 178.9 million. The FDIC has promulgated regulations implementing limitations on brokered deposits. Under the regulations, well-capitalized institutions are not subject to brokered deposit limitations, while adequately capitalized institutions are able to accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits only with a waiver from the FDIC and subject to restrictions on the interest rate that can be paid on such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions are not permitted to accept brokered deposits. Pursuant to the regulation, the Bank, as a well-capitalized institution, may accept brokered deposits. Should our capital ratios decline, this could limit our ability to replace brokered deposits when they mature. At December 31, 2022, the Bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized for purposes of these regulations. However, there can be no assurance that the Bank will continue to meet those requirements. Limitations on the Bank s ability to accept brokered deposits for any reason (including regulatory limitations on the amount of brokered deposits in total or as a percentage of total assets) in the future could materially adversely impact our funding costs and liquidity.

 The maturity of brokered certificates of deposit could result in a significant funding source maturing at one time. Should this occur, it might be difficult to replace the maturing certificates with new brokered certificates of deposit. We have used brokers to obtain these deposits which results in depositors with whom we have no other relationships since these depositors are outside of our market, and there may not be a sufficient source of new brokered certificates of deposit at the time of maturity. In addition, upon maturity, brokers could require us to offer some of the highest interest rates in the country to retain these deposits, which would negatively impact our earnings. The Markets in Which We Operate Are Highly Competitive We face intense and increasing competition both in making loans and in attracting deposits. Our market area has a high density of financial institutions, many of which have greater financial resources, name recognition and market presence than us, and all of which are our competitors to varying degrees. Particularly intense competition exists for deposits and in all of the lending activities we emphasize. Our competition for loans comes principally from other commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, finance companies and credit unions. Management anticipates that competition for mortgage loans will continue to increase in the future. Our most direct competition for deposits historically has come from savings banks, other commercial banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions. In addition, we face competition for deposits from products offered by brokerage firms, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries, such as money market and other mutual funds and annuities. Consolidation in the banking industry and the lifting of interstate banking and branching restrictions have made it more difficult for smaller, community-oriented banks, such as us, to compete effectively with large, national, regional and super-regional banking institutions. Our Internet Branch provides us with access to consumers in markets outside our geographic branch locations. The internet banking arena exposes us to competition with many larger financial institutions that have greater financial resources, name recognition and market presence than we do. Our Results of Operations May Be Adversely Affected by Changes in National, Regional and/or Local Economic Conditions Our operating results are affected by national, regional and local economic and competitive conditions, including changes in market interest rates, the strength of the local economy, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Adverse economic conditions can result in borrowers defaulting on their loans or withdrawing their funds on deposit at the Bank to meet their financial obligations. A decline in the local, regional or national economy or the New York City metropolitan area real estate market could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, including through decreased demand for loans or increased competition for good loans, increased non-performing loans and credit losses resulting in additional provisions for credit losses and for losses on real estate owned. Many factors could require additions to our allowance for credit losses in future periods above those currently maintained. These factors include, but are not limited to: (1) adverse changes in economic conditions and changes in interest rates that may affect the ability of borrowers to make payments on loans, (2) changes in the financial capacity of individual borrowers, (3) changes in the local real estate market and the value of our loan collateral, and (4) future review and evaluation of our loan portfolio, internally or by regulators. The amount of our allowance for credit losses at any time represents good faith estimates that are susceptible to significant changes due to changes in appraisal values of collateral, national and local economic conditions, prevailing interest rates and other factors. See Business General Allowance for Credit Losses in Item 1 of this Annual Report. These same factors could cause delinquencies to increase for the mortgages which are the collateral for the mortgage-backed securities we hold in our investment portfolio. Combining increased delinquencies with liquidity problems in the market could result in a decline in the market value of our investments in privately issued mortgage-backed securities. There can be no assurance that a decline in the market value of these investments will not result in other-than-temporary impairment charges in our financial statements. Changes in Laws and Regulations Could Adversely Affect Our Business From time to time, legislation, is enacted or regulations are promulgated that have the effect of increasing the cost of doing business, limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks and other financial institutions are frequently made in Congress, in the New York legislature and before various bank regulatory agencies. There can be no assurance as to the impact that any laws, regulations or governmental programs

Table of Contents 
 that may be introduced or implemented in the future will have on the financial markets and the economy, any of which could adversely affect our business. For a discussion of regulations affecting us, see Business Regulation and Business Federal, State and Local Taxation in Item 1 of this Annual Report. Current Conditions in, and Regulation of, the Banking Industry May Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Results of Operations Financial institutions have been the subject of significant legislative and regulatory changes, including the adoption of The Dodd Frank Act, which imposes a wide variety of regulations affecting us, and may be the subject of further significant legislation or regulation in the future, none of which is within our control. Significant new laws or regulations or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws or regulations, including those with respect to federal and state taxation, may cause our results of operations to differ materially. In addition, the cost and burden of compliance, over time, have significantly increased and could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. The Bank faces several minimum capital requirements imposed by federal regulation. Failure to adhere to these minimums could limit the dividends the Bank may pay, including the payment of dividends to the Company, and could limit the annual growth of the Bank. Under the Dodd Frank Act, banks with assets greater than 100.0 billion in total assets are required to complete stress tests, which predict capital levels under certain stress levels. See Regulation. At the New York State level, the Bank is subject to extensive supervision, regulation and examination by the New York State Department of Financial Services NYDFS and the FDIC. The Company is subject to similar regulations and oversight by the Federal Reserve Bank. Such regulations limit the manner in which the Company and Bank conduct business, undertake new investments and activities and obtain financing. The regulatory structure also provides the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to capital levels, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject the Company and Bank to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment of significant civil money penalties against the Company and/or the Bank. The FDIC regulations are designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and the Bank s depositors, and not to benefit the Company, the Bank, or its creditors. The fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Changes in Federal Reserve or governmental policies are beyond the Company s control and difficult to predict; consequently, the impact of these changes on the Company s activities and results of operations is also difficult to predict. See Changes in Interest Rates may impact our Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Factor in this Form 10-K. A Failure in or Breach of Our Operational or Security Systems or Infrastructure, or Those of Our Third Party Vendors and Other Service Providers, Including as a Result of Cyber-attacks, Could Disrupt Our Business, Result in the Disclosure or Misuse of Confidential or Proprietary Information, Damage Our Reputation, Increase Our Costs and Cause Losses We depend upon our ability to process, record, and monitor our client transactions on a continuous basis. As client, public and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting and data processing systems, or other operating systems and facilities, may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there could be electrical or telecommunications outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and floods; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as described below, cyber-attacks. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and clients. Information security risks for financial institutions such as ours have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct 
 47 

Table of Contents 
 financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties. Threat actor organizations are becoming more formal and now frequently include specialized departments within an organization. These include access specialists, lateral movement specialists, and initial access brokers. These functions combine together to sell the access to interested parties, and the parties purchasing the access are installing malware and infiltrating data. This increases cyber risk as indicators of an attack may be spread across multiple detection platforms and coming from distributed sources. As noted above, our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission, and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks. Our business relies on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software and networks to conduct its operations. In addition, to access our products and services, our clients may use personal smartphones, tablet PC s, personal computers and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Although we have information security procedures and controls in place, our technologies, systems, networks and our clients devices may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our clients confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our clients or other third parties business operations. We may be subject to increasingly more risk related to cyber security for our Internet Branch as we expand our suite of online direct banking products, acquire new or outsource some of our business operations, expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications, and otherwise attempt to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the financial services industry. We rely on external infrastructure, proprietary information technology and third-party systems and services to conduct business, including customer service, marketing and sales activities, customer relationship management, producing financial statements and technology/data centers. In addition, we store and process confidential and proprietary business information on both company-owned and third-party and/or vendor managed systems, including cloud service providers. We increasingly rely on the internet in order to conduct business and may be adversely impacted by outages in critical infrastructure such as electric grids, undersea cables, satellites or other communications used by us or our third parties. This reliance includes consumer access to the internet and communications systems due to more work taking place outside of corporate locations. The failure of our or any third party s information technology, infrastructure or other internal and external systems, for any reason, could disrupt our operations, result in the loss of business and adversely impact our profitability. Any compromise of the security of our or any third party s systems that results in the disclosure of personally identifiable customer or employee information could damage our reputation, deter customers from purchasing or using our products and services, expose us to litigation, increase regulatory scrutiny and require us to incur significant technical, legal and other expenses. We may also be adversely impacted by successful cyberattacks of our partners, third-party vendors and others in our supply chain with whom we conduct business or share information. Financial services companies are regularly targeted by cyber criminals, resulting in unauthorized access to confidential information, theft of funds from online accounts, disruption or degradation of service or other damage. These attacks may take a variety of forms, including web application attacks, denial of service attacks, ransomware, other malware, and social engineering, including phishing. As automation and machine intelligence technologies progress, attackers are adopting this technology to speed up their reconnaissance and attacks while reducing their costs. This improved efficiency and tooling means that a lower-skilled adversary is able to perform more attacks at a higher complexity level than in the past. Economic and political instability offers a fertile ground for adversaries to recruit new talent. This could be either people looking for financial gains amid job losses and high inflation, politically motivated actors driven by state conflicts or internal political unrest, or other personal reasons. In addition, the reengineering and reuse of prior attack methodologies is made easier by advances in these technologies. Information security incidents may also occur due to the failure to control access to, and use of, sensitive systems or information by our workforce. Employee risk exposure remains high as cybersecurity awareness training must be continuously refined and updated as technology advances and threat actors become increasingly more sophisticated. Additionally, there is a potential increase in this threat due to the increase in remote work. The failure of our controls (such as policies, procedures, security controls and monitoring, automation and backup plans) designed to prevent, or limit the effect of, failure, inadvertent use or abuse could result in disruptions or breaches beyond our control. Although to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature of these threats. As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a focus for us. As technology evolves, we can increase our ability to detect and prevent cyber-attacks through automation and the implementation of security controls which leverage machine

Table of Contents 
 learning and artificial intelligence. As threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities. Additionally, information security vulnerabilities can pose increased cyber-risk as they can be combined and chained together more easily with machine learning technology. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and clients, or cyberattacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our clients use to access our products and services could result in significant legal and financial exposure, client attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs and/or additional compliance costs, a loss of confidence in the security of our systems, any of which may not be covered by insurance and could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, in 2017, the NYDFS established comprehensive cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies, including us, and the NYDFS has proposed additional changes to such regulations. See Regulation New York State Law. Changes in Cybersecurity or Privacy Regulations may Increase our Compliance Costs, Limit Our Ability to Gain Insight from Data and Lead to Increased Scrutiny We collect, process, store, share, disclose and use information from and about our customers, plan participants and website and application users, including personal information and other data. Any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, privacy-related obligations to customers or third parties, data disclosure and consent obligations or privacy or security-related legal obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements critical of us. Such actual or perceived failures could also cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Restrictions on data collection and use may limit opportunities to gain business insights useful to running our business and offering innovative products and services. We are subject to numerous federal, state, and international regulations regarding the privacy and security of personal information. These laws vary widely by jurisdiction. Privacy regulations with a significant impact on our operations include the NYDFS 23 NYCRR Part 500 Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Title V Subtitle A- Safeguards Rule, and FDIC Part 364 Appendix B- Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards. Similar legislation is being enacted around the world with requirements and protections specific to data security requirements, notification requirements for data breaches, the right to access personal data and the right to be forgotten. In one such recent development applicable to us, effective April 2022, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC issued a rule that, among other things, requires a banking organization to notify its primary federal regulators within 36 hours after identifying a computer-security incident that the banking organization believes in good faith could materially disrupt, degrade or impair its business or operations in a manner that would, among other things, jeopardize the viability of its operations, result in customers being unable to access their deposit and other accounts, result in a material loss of revenue, profit or franchise value, or pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States. Further, in November 2022, the NYDFS released proposed amendments to Part 500 that covered entities would be required to notify the NYDFS within 72 hours of (i) any cybersecurity event that has a reasonable likelihood of disrupting or degrading any part of a company s normal operations, (ii) any unauthorized access to a privileged account or deployment of ransomware within a material part of the company s information systems, and (iii) any cybersecurity event at a third party service provider that affects a covered entity In addition covered entities would be required to notify the NYDFS within 24 hours of an extortion payment made in connection with a cybersecurity event involving the covered entity. Also, within 90 days of a cybersecurity event, covered entities would be required to provide information requested by the NYDFS regarding the investigation of the cybersecurity event and would have a continuing obligation to update and supplement the information provided. These and other changes in cybersecurity and privacy regulations or the enactment of new regulations may increase our compliance costs and failure to comply with these regulations may lead to reputational damage, fines or civil damages and increased regulatory scrutiny . We May Experience Increased Delays in Foreclosure Proceedings Foreclosure proceedings face increasing delays. While we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any delay in foreclosure sales, we may be subject to additional borrower and non-borrower litigation and governmental and regulatory 
 49 

Table of Contents 
 scrutiny related to our past and current foreclosure activities. Delays in foreclosure sales, including any delays beyond those currently anticipated could increase the costs associated with our mortgage operations and make it more difficult for us to prevent losses in our loan portfolio. Our Inability to Hire or Retain Key Personnel Could Adversely Affect Our Business Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain and attract key personnel. We face intense competition from commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, finance companies and credit unions. As a result, it could prove difficult to retain and attract key personnel. The inability to hire or retain key personnel may result in the loss of customer relationships and may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. We Are Not Required to Pay Dividends on Our Common Stock Holders of shares of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. A reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. There is Uncertainty Surrounding the Elimination of LIBOR and the Proposed Transition to SOFR or Other Adjustable or Reference Rate Formulas In 2017, the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR ). Consequently, LIBOR and other inter-bank offered rates around the world are undergoing a transition to other reference rates. In March 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority announced that LIBOR would no longer be published on a representative basis after December 31, 2021, with the exception of the most commonly used tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR, which will no longer be published on a representative basis after June 30, 2023. There is still uncertainty around how quickly different alternative rates will develop sufficient liquidity and industry-wide usage, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments. The U.S. Federal Reserve, based on the recommendations of the New York Federal Reserve s Alternative Reference Rate Committee (comprised of major derivative market participants and their regulators), began publishing in April 2018 a Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), which is intended to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. Proposals for alternative reference rates have also been announced or have already begun publication. Markets are developing in response to these new rates. We have undertaken an enterprise-wide effort to address the transition to minimize the potential for adverse impacts. On March 15, 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022, which includes the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, or LIBOR Act, was signed into law in the U.S. This legislation establishes a uniform benchmark replacement process for financial contracts maturing after June 30, 2023 that do not contain clearly defined or practicable fallback provisions. Under the LIBOR Act, such contracts will automatically transition as a matter of law to a SOFR-based replacement rate identified by the Federal Reserve Board. The legislation also creates a safe harbor that shields lenders from litigation if they choose to utilize a replacement rate recommended by the Federal Reserve. The effect of any changes to LIBOR or discontinuation of LIBOR on new or existing financial instruments, liabilities or operational processes will vary depending on a number of factors. Examples of potential factors include, but are not limited to: fallback provisions in contracts; adoption of replacement language in contracts where such language is currently absent; legislative remedies that address fallback provisions; potential changes in spreads causing valuation changes; treatment of hedge effectiveness and impacts on models and systems. We are identifying, assessing and monitoring market and regulatory developments; assessing agreement terms and continue to execute our operational readiness. We have loans, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR could create additional costs and risks. Since proposed alternative rates 
 50 

Table of Contents 
 are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates may differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition will change our market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, systems, contracts, valuation tools, and product design. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation and potentially introduce additional legal risks. As of December 31, 2022, we have exposure to approximately 1.8 billion of financial assets and liabilities, including off-balance sheet instruments, which are LIBOR-based. We do not yet know whether, and if so the extent to which, the elimination of LIBOR will have any material impact on these instruments. The transition to other reference rates may affect the value of certain derivatives, loans and floating rate securities we hold, floating rate financial instruments we have issued and the profitability of certain lending activity. Additionally, pricing activities, models and the profitability of certain businesses may also be impacted. Our Financial Results May be Adversely Impacted by Global Climate Changes. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have increased dramatically since the industrial revolution, resulting in a gradual increase in average global temperatures and an increase in the frequency and severity of weather patterns and natural disasters. These trends are expected to continue in the future and have the potential to impact nearly all sectors of the economy to varying degrees. We cannot predict the long-term impacts of climate change, but we will continue to monitor new developments in the future. Potential impacts may include the following: Changes in temperatures and air quality may adversely impact the health, welfare, economic and other prospects of customers in our target markets. For example, increases in the level of pollution and airborne allergens in local industrial areas may cause an increase in upper respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Such impacts may adversely change the long-term prospects for the communities we serve and the investing and banking services these communities seek. Climate change may impact asset prices, as well as general economic conditions. For example, rising sea levels may lead to decreases in real estate values in at-risk areas. Additionally, government policies to slow climate change (e.g., setting limits on carbon emissions) may have an adverse impact on sectors such as utilities, transportation and manufacturing. Changes in asset prices may impact the value of our fixed income, real estate and commercial mortgage investments. Although we seek to manage our investment risks by maintaining a diversified portfolio and monitor our investments on an ongoing basis, allowing us to adjust our exposure to sectors and/or geographical areas that face severe risks due to climate change, there can be no assurances that our efforts will be successful. Our Financial Results May be Adversely Impacted by ESG Requirements Our financial and operational results could be impacted by emerging risk and changes to the regulatory landscape in areas like environmental, social and governance ESG requirements. We closely monitor and respond to topics related to ESG that include longer lifespans, income and wealth inequalities, environmental challenges and opportunities to expand global access to the financial system across all segments of the population. Updated and changing regulatory and societal environment requirements could impact financial and operational results. We currently obtain environmental reports in connection with the underwriting of commercial real estate loans, and typically obtain environmental reports in connection with the underwriting of multi-family loans. For all other loans, we obtain environmental reports only if the nature of the current or, to the extent known to us, prior use of the property securing the loan indicates a potential environmental risk. However, we may not be aware of such uses or risks in any particular case, and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that real estate acquired by us in foreclosure is free from environmental contamination nor we will not have any liability with respect thereto. Changes and uncertainty in United States legislation, policy or regulation regarding climate risk management or other ESG practices may result in higher regulatory and compliance costs, increased capital expenditures, and changes in regulations may impact security asset prices, resulting in realized or unrealized losses on our investments. Physical risks and transitional risks could increase the Company s cost of doing business and actual or perceived failure to adequately address ESG expectations of our various stakeholders could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of customers and clients.

 Stock Performance Graph The following graph shows a comparison of cumulative total stockholder return on the Company s common stock since December 31, 2017 with the cumulative total returns of a broad equity market index as well as comparative published industry indices. The broad equity market index chosen was the Nasdaq Composite and the comparative published industry indices used were the S P U.S. MidCap Banks Index and the S P U.S. BMI Banks - Mid-Atlantic Region Index. The S P U.S. BMI Banks - Mid-Atlantic Region Index was chosen for inclusion in the Company s Stock Performance Graph because the Company believes it provides valuable comparative information reflecting the Company s geographic peer group. The S P U.S. MidCap Banks Index was chosen for inclusion in the Company s Stock Performance Graph because it uses a broader group of banks and therefore more closely reflects the Company s size. The Company believes that both geographic area and size are important factors in analyzing the Company s performance against its peers. The graph below reflects historical performance only, which is not indicative of possible future performance of the common stock. The total return assumes 100 invested on December 31, 2017 and all dividends reinvested through the end of the Company s fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.

The Bank s deposits are insured to the maximum allowable amount by the FDIC. The Holding Company also owns Flushing Financial Capital Trust II, Flushing Financial Capital Trust III, and Flushing Financial Capital Trust IV (the Trusts ), which are special purpose business trusts formed during 2007 to issue a total of 60.0 million of capital securities, and 1.9 million of common securities (which are the only voting securities). The Holding Company owns 100 of the common securities of the Trusts. The Trusts used the proceeds from the issuance of these securities to purchase junior subordinated debentures from the Holding Company. The Trusts are not included in our consolidated financial statements, as we would not absorb the losses of the Trusts if losses were to occur. The following discussion of financial condition and results of operations includes the collective results of the Holding Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company ), but reflects principally the Bank s activities. Management views the Company as operating as a single unit - a community bank. Therefore, segment information is not provided. Overview Our principal business is attracting retail deposits from the general public and investing those deposits together with funds generated from ongoing operations and borrowings, primarily in (1) originations and purchases of multi-family residential properties, commercial business loans, commercial real estate mortgage loans and, to a lesser extent, one-to-four family (focusing on mixed-use properties, which are properties that contain both residential dwelling units and commercial units); (2) construction loans; (3) Small Business Administration SBA loans; (4) mortgage loan surrogates such as mortgage-backed securities; and (5) U.S. government securities, corporate fixed-income securities and other marketable securities. We also originate certain other consumer loans including overdraft lines of credit. Our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income, which is the difference between the income earned on its interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is the result of our interest rate margin, which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, adjusted for the difference in the average balance of interest-earning assets as compared to the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. We also generate non-interest income from loan fees, service charges on deposit accounts, mortgage servicing fees, and other fees, income earned on Bank Owned Life Insurance BOLI ), dividends on Federal Home Bank of New York FHLB-NY stock and net gains and losses on sales of securities and loans. Our operating expenses consist principally of employee compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, other general and

 administrative expenses and income tax expense. Our results of operations can also be significantly affected by our periodic provision for credit losses and specific provision for losses on real estate owned. Management Strategy. Our strategy is to continue our focus on being an institution serving consumers, businesses, and governmental units in our local markets. To achieve this objective, we intend to: manage cost of funds and continue to improve funding mix; add loans with appropriate risk adjusted returns; enhance earnings power by improving scalability and efficiency; manage credit risk; remain well capitalized; increase our commitment to the multi-cultural marketplace, with a particular focus on the Asian community; attract, retain and develop human capital; and manage enterprise-wide risk. 
 There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively implement this strategy. Our strategy is subject to change by the Board of Directors. Manage cost of funds and continue to improve funding mix. We have a relatively stable retail deposit base drawn from our market area through our full-service offices. Although we seek to retain existing deposits and maintain depositor relationships by offering quality service and competitive interest rates to our customers, we also seek to keep deposit growth within reasonable limits and our strategic plan. In order to implement our strategic plan, we have built multi-channel deposit gathering capabilities. In addition to our full-service branches we gather deposits through our Internet Branch and a government banking unit. The Internet Branch currently offers savings accounts, money market accounts, checking accounts, and certificates of deposit. This allows us to compete on a national scale without the geographical constraints of physical locations. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, total deposits at our Internet Branch were 154.6 million and 188.0 million, respectively. The government banking unit provides banking services to public municipalities, including counties, cities, towns, villages, school districts, libraries, fire districts, and the various courts throughout the New York City metropolitan area. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, total deposits in our government banking unit totaled 1,653.3 million and 1,618.8 million, respectively. Additionally, we have a business banking group which was designed specifically to develop full business relationships thereby bringing in lower-costing checking and money market deposits. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, deposits balances in the business banking group were 386.6 million and 540.4 million, respectively. We also obtain deposits through brokers and the IntraFi Network. Management intends to balance its goal to maintain competitive interest rates on deposits while seeking to manage its overall cost of funds to finance its strategies. We generally rely on our deposit base as our principal source of funding. During 2022, we realized an increase in due to depositors (excluding escrow accounts) of 103.7 million, as certificates of deposits increased 579.8 million and core deposits decreased 476.1 million. We continue to focus on obtaining additional deposits from our lending customers and originating additional loans to our deposit customers. Product offerings were expanded and are expected to be further expanded to accommodate perceived customer demands. In addition, specific employees are assigned responsibilities of generating these additional deposits and loans by coordinating efforts between lending and deposit gathering departments.

 Management has added loans with appropriate risk adjusted returns. During 2022, gross loans increased by 291.9 million, or 4.4 to 6,925.8 million at December 31, 2022, from 6,633.9 million at December 31, 2021. Multi-family residential and commercial real estate accounted for 37.57 and 27.62 , respectively, of the balances in 2022. We have emphasized the strategic growth of multi-family residential mortgage loans, non-owner occupied commercial mortgage loans, and floating rate commercial business loans. The commercial business and other loans have increased to 21.97 of the gross loan portfolio as of December 31, 2022 compared to 20.19 at December 31, 2021. The following table shows loan originations and purchases during 2022, and loan balances as of December 31, 2022. 

Loan Loan Balances Originations and December 31, Percent of Purchases 2022 Gross Loans (Dollars in thousands) Multi-family residential 474,409 2,601,384 37.57 Commercial real estate 308,455 1,913,040 27.62 One-to-four family mixed-use property 37,598 554,314 8.00 One-to-four family residential 25,059 241,246 3.48 Construction 31,592 70,951 1.02 Small Business Administration 3,461 23,275 0.34 Commercial business and Other 641,420 1,521,548 21.97 Total 1,521,994 6,925,758 100.00 At December 31, 2022, multi-family residential, commercial business and other loans and commercial real estate loans, totaled 87.2 of our gross loans. We have repositioned our loan growth to reduce credit risk; however, our concentration in these types of loans could require us to increase our provisions for credit losses and to maintain an allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans in excess of the allowance currently maintained. Enhance earnings power by improving scalability and efficiency. We are improving scalability and efficiency by converting our branches to the Universal Banker model with our unique video banker service that gives customers face-to-face video chat access 24 hours daily, seven days per week, at our ATM terminals. The Universal Banker model provides customers with cutting-edge technology, including state-of-the-art ATMs and a higher-quality service experience, all while further reducing overall costs. In 2022, we completed this conversion effort. Nearly 50 of customer transactions were completed at our high powered ATMs. Manage credit risk. By adherence to our conservative underwriting standards, we have been able to minimize net losses from non-performing loans. We recorded net charge-offs of 1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to net charge-offs of 3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. We seek to minimize losses by adhering to our defined underwriting standards, which among other things generally requires a debt service coverage ratio of at least 125 and loan to value ratio of 75 or less. The average loan to value for the real estate dependent loan portfolio was less than 37 and the average loan to value for non-performing loans collateralized by real estate was 36.0 at December 31, 2022. We seek to maintain our loans in performing status through, among other things, disciplined collection efforts, and consistently monitoring non-performing assets in an effort to return them to performing status. To this end, we review the quality of our loans and report to the Loan Committee of the Board of Directors of the Bank on a monthly basis. We sold seven delinquent loans totaling 6.9 million, 33 delinquent loans totaling 28.6 million, and two delinquent loans totaling 0.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. There can be no assurances that we will continue this strategy in future periods, or if continued, we will be able to find buyers to pay adequate consideration. Non-performing loans totaled 32.4 million and 14.9 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.63 and 0.19 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Remain well capitalized. The Bank faces several minimum capital requirements imposed by federal regulation. Failure to adhere to these minimums could limit the dividends the Bank is allowed to pay, including the payment of dividends to the Holding Company, and could limit the annual growth of the Bank. Under the Dodd Frank Act, banks with assets greater than 10 billion in total assets are required to complete stress tests, which predict capital levels under certain 
 57 

Table of Contents 
 stress levels. Although, our total assets are currently 8.4 billion, as a best practice, we completed these tests. As of December 31, 2022, under our stress scenarios, we remained well capitalized per current regulations. Increase Our Commitment to the Multi-Cultural Marketplace, with a Particular Focus on the Asian Community. Our branches are all located in the New York City metropolitan area with particular concentration in the borough of Queens. Queens is characterized with a high level of ethnic diversity. An important element of our strategy is to service multi-ethnic consumers and businesses. We have a particular presence and concentration in Asian communities, including in particular the Chinese and Korean populations. Both groups are noted for high levels of savings, education and entrepreneurship. In order to service these and other important ethnic groups in our market, our staff speaks more than 20 languages. We have an Asian advisory board to help broaden our links to the community by providing guidance and fostering awareness of our active role in the local community. As of December 31, 2022, we had seven branches which have a particular focus on the Asian community, of which five are in the borough of Queens, one is in the borough of Manhattan and one on Long Island, with deposits and loans totaling 1,072.4 million and 800.6 million, respectively, in these locations. Manage Enterprise-Wide Risk. We identify, measure and attempt to mitigate risks that affect, or have the potential to affect, our business. Due to past economic crises and recent increases in government regulation, we devote significant resources to risk management. We have a seasoned risk officer to provide executive risk leadership, and an enterprise-wide risk management program. Several enterprise risk management analytical products are in use which include key risk indicators. We also have had a chief information security officer even before one was required by NYDFS rulemaking. Our management of enterprise-wide risk enables us to recognize and monitor risks and establish procedures to disseminate the risk information across our organization and to our Board of Directors. The objective is to have a robust and focused risk management process capable of identifying and mitigating emerging threats to the Bank s safety and soundness. Trends and Contingencies. Our operating results are significantly affected by national, regional and local economic and competitive conditions, including changes in market interest rates, the strength of the local and regional economy, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. We have remained strategically focused on the origination of multi-family residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and commercial business loans with a full banking relationship. Because of this strategy, we were able to continue to achieve a higher yield on our mortgage portfolio than we would have otherwise experienced . Loan originations and purchases were 1,521.9 million, 1,254.0 million, and 1,004.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. While we primarily rely on originating our own loans, we purchased 275.7 million, 262.1 million, and 193.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. We purchase loans when the loans complement our loan portfolio strategy. Loans purchased must meet our underwriting standards when they were originated. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, the allocation of our loan portfolio has remained fairly consistent with a steady increase in non-mortgage loans. The majority of our loans are collateralized by real estate, which comprised 77.7 of our portfolio at December 31, 2022 compared to 78.4 at December 31, 2021 and 78.0 at December 31, 2020, while non-mortgage loans comprised 22.3 of our portfolio at December 31, 2022 compared to 21.6 at December 31, 2021 and 22.0 at December 31, 2020. Due to depositors increased 103.7 million, 242.8 million, and 1,068.7 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Core deposits decreased 476.1 million in 2022, but increased 434.6 million, and 1,368.2 million in 2021, and 2020, respectively. Certificates of deposit increased 579.8 million during 2022 compared to decreases of 191.8 million during 2021 and 299.5 million in 2020. Brokered deposits represented 13.2 , 9.8 , and 17.5 of total deposits at December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, reciprocal deposits totaled 659.5 million, 763.7 million, and 735.4 million, respectively. Prevailing interest rates affect the extent to which borrowers repay and refinance loans. In a declining interest rate environment, the number of loan prepayments and loan refinancing tends to increase, as do prepayments of mortgage-backed securities. Call provisions associated with our investments in U.S. government agency and corporate securities may also adversely affect yield in a declining interest rate environment. Such prepayments and calls may adversely affect the yield of our loan portfolio and mortgage-backed and other securities as we reinvest the prepaid funds in a lower interest rate environment. However, we typically receive additional loan fees when existing loans are refinanced, which partially 
 58 

Table of Contents 
 offsets the reduced yield on our loan portfolio resulting from prepayments. In periods of low interest rates, our level of core deposits also may decline if depositors seek higher-yielding instruments or other investments not offered by us, which in turn may increase our cost of funds and decrease our net interest margin to the extent alternative funding sources, are utilized. By contrast, an increasing interest rate environment would tend to extend the average lives of lower yielding fixed rate mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, which could adversely affect net interest income. In addition, depositors tend to open longer term, higher costing certificate of deposit accounts which could adversely affect our net interest income if rates were to subsequently decline. Additionally, adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities generally contain interim and lifetime caps that limit the amount the interest rate can increase at re-pricing dates. Net interest income decreased 4.4 million or 1.8 to 243.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 from 248.0 million for the prior year, as a 13 basis points decrease in the net interest margin to 3.11 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 more than offset the 162.7 million increase in average earning assets. The decrease in the net interest margin for 2022 was primarily due to an increase in our funding costs, partially offset by an increase in the yield of our interest-earning assets. The increase in the yield of our interest earning assets was primarily due to loans being both originated and repriced at higher rates. During 2022, the cost of borrowed funds increased 30 basis points to 2.54 from 2.24 in the comparable prior period while the cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 50 basis points to 0.87 from 0.37 for the prior year. The cost of money market, NOW and certificates of deposits accounts increased 52 basis points, 53 basis points, and 51 basis points, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 from the prior year. The cost of deposits rose as we increased the rates we pay resulting from the Federal Reverse raising rates. We are unable to predict the direction or timing of future interest rate changes. Approximately 67 of our certificates of deposit accounts and borrowings will reprice or mature during the next year. Also, in an increasing interest rate environment, mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities may prepay at slower rates than experienced in the past, which could result in a reduction of prepayment penalty income. Interest Rate Risk Economic Value of Equity Analysis . The Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ), which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in fair value of certain investments due to changes in interest rates. Generally, the fair value of financial investments such as loans and securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. As a result, increases in interest rates could result in decreases in the fair value of the Company s interest-earning assets which could adversely affect the Company s results of operations if such assets were sold, or, in the case of securities classified as available for sale, decreases in the Company s stockholders equity, if such securities were retained. The Company quantifies the net portfolio value should interest rates immediately go up or down 200 basis points, assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other. Net portfolio value is defined as the market value of assets net of the market value of liabilities. The market value of assets and liabilities is determined using a discounted cash flow calculation. The net portfolio value ratio is the ratio of the net portfolio value to the market value of assets. The changes in value are measured as percentage changes from the net portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario. The base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Various estimates regarding prepayment assumptions are made at each level of rate shock. The following table presents the Company s interest rate shock as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: 

Net Portfolio Value Net Portfolio Value Ratio Change in Interest Rate 2022 2021 2022 2021 -200 Basis points (1) 5.69 - 12.51 - -100 Basis points 3.20 (4.36) 12.47 11.53 Base interest rate - - 12.33 12.27 +100 Basis points (5.80) (5.41) 11.85 11.86 +200 Basis points (11.55) (11.33) 11.35 11.36 (1) For 2021 the -200 basis points scenario was not calculated.

 Income Simulation Analysis. The Company manages the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities on a continuous basis to maximize return and adjust its exposure to interest rate risk. On a quarterly basis, management provides a report for review by the ALCO Investment Committee of the Board of Directors. This report quantifies the potential changes in net interest income and net portfolio value through various interest rate scenarios. The starting point for the net interest income simulation is an estimate of the next twelve month s net interest income assuming that both interest rates and the Company s interest-sensitive assets and liabilities remain at period-end levels. The report quantifies the potential changes in net interest income should interest rates go up or down 100 or 200 basis points (shocked), assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other. All changes in income are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income at the base interest rate scenario. The base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Various estimates regarding prepayment assumptions are made at each level of rate shock. However, prepayment penalty income is excluded from this analysis. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. The following table presents the Company s interest rate shock compared to Net Interest Income as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: 

Projected Percentage Change In Net Interest Income Change in Interest Rate 2022 2021 -200 Basis points (1) 5.73 -100 Basis points 3.64 0.41 Base interest rate - +100 Basis points (7.31) (7.49) +200 Basis points (14.61) (15.01) (1) For 2021 the -200 basis points scenario was not calculated. 
 Another net interest income simulation assumes that changes in interest rates change gradually in equal increments over the twelve-month period. Prepayment penalty income is excluded from this analysis. Based on these assumptions, net interest income would be reduced by 8.6 from a 200 basis point increase in rates over the next twelve months. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. At December 31, 2022, the Company had a derivative portfolio with a notional value totaling 1.4 billion. This portfolio is designed to provide protection against rising interest rates. See Note 21 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. A portion of this portfolio is comprised of forward swaps on certain short-term advances and brokered deposits totaling 871.5 million. At December 31, 2022, 591.5 million of the forward swaps are effective swaps at a weighted average rate of 2.41 . Of this, 295.8 million at an average rate of 2.23 will mature by the end of 2023 and will be replaced by forward starting swaps totaling 230.0 million that become effective at different points through 2023, at an average rate of 0.70 . The net interest income simulation incorporates the next twelve months (through December 31, 2023) and only a portion of the effective swap maturities and the forward starting swaps are included in this period. Assuming another equal increment ramp of 100 basis points increase in rates in the second year (through December 31, 2024), for a total of 200 basis points over two years, the total derivative portfolio has a 4.7 benefit to net interest income (versus the base case) in the first year and a cumulative benefit of 9.6 by the second year.

 Analysis of Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends upon the relative amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rate earned or paid on them. The following table sets forth certain information relating to our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the periods indicated. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown. Average balances are derived from average daily balances. The yields include amortization of fees that are considered adjustments to yields.

 Rate/Volume Analysis The following table presents the impact of changes in interest rates and in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities on the Company s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to (1) changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by the prior rate), (2) changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by the prior volume) and (3) the net change. The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate.

Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 was 76.9 million, a decrease of 4.8 million, or 5.9 , compared to 81.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. Diluted earnings per common share were 2.50 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of 0.09, or 3.5 , from 2.59 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. Return on average equity decreased to 11.44 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, from 12.60 for the comparable prior year period. Return on average assets decreased to 0.93 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 from 1.00 for the comparable prior year period. Interest Income . Interest income increased 28.1 million, or 9.7 , to 316.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 288.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase of 162.7 million in the average balance of interest-earning assets to 7,835.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 7,673.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and an increase of 28 basis points in the yield of interest-earning assets to 4.05 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 3.77 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The 28 basis point increase in the yield of interest-earning assets was primarily due to a 22 basis point increase in the yield on loans to 4.35 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 4.13 in the prior year, an increase in the yield of total securities to 2.22 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 1.72 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and an increase in the yield on interest-earning deposits and federal funds sold of 172 basis points to 1.83 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 0.11 in for the comparable prior year period. These rate increases were all driven by the rising

Table of Contents 
 interest rate environment experienced in 2022. Excluding prepayment penalty income from loans and securities, net recoveries/(reversals) of interest from non-accrual loans, net gains (losses) from fair value adjustments on qualifying hedges, and purchase accounting adjustments, the yield on total loans, net, increased 25 basis points to 4.20 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 3.95 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Interest Expense . Interest expense increased 32.4 million, or 79.9 , to 73.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 40.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase of 50 basis points in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 1.13 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 0.63 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The 50 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to the 50 basis point increase in the yield on interest-bearing deposits to 0.87 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 0.37 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to the Company s response to the Federal Reserve increasing rates. Additionally, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased due to a rise of 107.1 million in the average balance of higher costing borrowed funds to 1,012.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 905.1 million for the comparable prior year period. Net Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled 243.6 million, a decrease of 4.4 million, or 1.8 , from 248.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to a 22 basis point decrease in the net interest spread to 2.92 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 from 3.14 for the comparable prior year period. The net interest margin decreased 13 basis points to 3.11 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 3.24 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Included in net interest income was prepayment penalty and net recovered interest income from loans and securities totaling 6.4 million and 6.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, net gains from fair value adjustments on qualifying hedges totaling 0.8 million and 2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and purchase accounting income adjustments of 2.5 million and 3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Excluding all of these items, the net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 2.99 , a decrease of 9 basis points, from to 3.08 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Provision (Benefit) for Credit Losses . Provision for credit losses was 5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a benefit for credit losses of 4.9 million during the prior year. The provision recorded in 2022 was primarily due to loan growth, increased reserves on specific credits, coupled with the ongoing environmental uncertainty resulting from high and rising inflation including increasing interest rates. The benefit recorded in 2021 was primarily due to improving economic conditions. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, non-accrual loans increased 17.4 million to 32.4 million from 14.9 million at December 31, 2021. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Bank recorded net charge-offs totaling 1.5 million compared to 3.1 million recorded in the comparable prior year period. The average loan-to-value ratio for our non-performing assets collateralized by real estate was 52.3 at December 31, 2022. The Bank continues to maintain conservative underwriting standards. Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 was 10.0 million, an increase of 6.3 million, or 171.5 , from 3.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. Non-interest income increased primarily due to an increase in non-cash net gains from fair value adjustments of 18.7 million and life insurance proceeds of 1.8 million, partially offset by an 11.1 million change in net loss on the sale of securities for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. During 2022, the Company decided to sell low yielding securities recognizing a loss of 10.9 million and redeploying the proceeds into higher yielding securities. Non-Interest Expense . Non-interest expense was 143.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of 3.6 million, or 2.5 , from 147.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in non-interest expense was primarily due to a 3.9 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits, primarily due to a 1.4 million employee retention tax credit refund and a 2.8 million reduction in expense from benefit plans due to an increase in the discount rate used to calculate the outstanding liability. Income Tax Provisions. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 0.4 million, or 1.5 , to 27.9 million, compared to 27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the effective tax rate to 26.6 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 25.2 in the prior year, partially offset by the 4.4 million decrease in income before income taxes during the same period. The increase in the 
 63 

Table of Contents 
 effective tax rate was primarily due to the Bank s average assets for 2022 exceeding 8.0 billion, resulting in the loss of certain tax deductions. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act IRA of 2022 was signed into law to implement new tax provisions and provide various incentives and tax credits. The IRA created a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax and an excise tax of 1 on stock repurchases from publicly traded United States corporations, among other changes. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has determined that neither this Act nor changes to income tax laws or regulations in other jurisdictions have a significant impact on income tax expense. Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (1) Liquidity, Regulatory Capital and Capital Resources Liquidity and Capital Resources . Liquidity is the ability to economically meet current and future financial obligations. The Company s primary objectives in terms of managing liquidity is to maintain the ability to originate and purchase loans, repay borrowings as they mature, satisfy financial obligations that arise in the normal course of business and meet our customer s deposit withdrawal needs. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, principal and interest payments on loans, mortgage-backed and other securities, and proceeds from sales of securities and loans. Deposit flows and mortgage prepayments, however, are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The Company has other sources of liquidity, including unsecured overnight lines of credit, brokered deposits and other types of borrowings. Liquidity management is both a short and long-term function of business management. During 2022, funds were provided by the Company s operating and financing activities, which were used to fund our investing activities. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which include cash and due from banks, overnight interest-earning deposits and federal funds sold with original maturities of 90 days or less. The level of these assets is dependent on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents totaled 151.8 million, an increase of 70.0 million from December 31, 2021. We also held marketable securities available for sale with a market value of 735.4 million at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, the Bank was able to borrow up to 3,800.1 million from the FHLB-NY in Federal Home Loan Bank advances and letters of credit. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank had 1,889.2 million outstanding in combined balances of FHLB-NY advances and letters of credit. At December 31, 2022, the Bank also has unsecured lines of credit with other commercial banks totaling 1,108.0 million, with none outstanding. In addition, the Holding Company has subordinated debentures with a principal balance totaling 190.0 million and junior subordinated debentures with a face amount of 61.9 million and a carrying amount of 50.5 million. (See Note 10 Borrowed Funds of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.) Management believes its available sources of funds are sufficient to fund current operations. At December 31, 2022, we had commitments to extend credit of 55.1 million and open lines of credit for borrowers of 383.4 million. Since generally all of the loan commitments are expected to be drawn upon, the total loan commitments approximate future cash requirements, whereas the amounts of lines of credit may not be indicative of our future cash requirements. The loan commitments generally expire in 90 days, while construction loan lines of credit mature within 18 months and home equity loan lines of credit mature within 10 years. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments. (See Note 17 Commitment and Contingencies in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report).

 Our total interest expense and non-interest expense in 2022 were 73.0 million and 143.7 million, respectively. We maintain three postretirement defined benefit plans for our employees: a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan which was frozen as of September 30, 2006, a contributory medical plan, and a noncontributory life insurance plan. The life insurance plan was amended to discontinue providing life insurance benefits to future retirees after January 1, 2010 and the medical plan was frozen to employees hired after January 1, 2011. We also maintain a noncontributory defined benefit plan for certain of our non-employee directors, which was frozen as of January 1, 2004. The employee pension plan is the only plan that we have funded. During 2022, we incurred cash expenditures of 0.1 million for each of the medical and life insurance plans and the non-employee director plan. We did not make a contribution to the employee pension plan in 2022. We expect to pay similar amounts for these plans in 2023. (See Note 13 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.) The amounts reported in our financial statements are obtained from reports prepared by independent actuaries and are based on significant assumptions. The most significant assumption is the discount rate used to determine the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation APBO for these plans. The APBO is the present value of projected benefits that employees and retirees have earned to date. The discount rate is a single rate at which the liabilities of the plans are discounted into today s dollars and could be effectively settled or eliminated. The discount rate used is based on the FTSE Pension Discount Curve (formerly the Citigroup Pension Liability Index) and reflects a rate that could be earned on bonds over a similar period that we anticipate the plans liabilities will be paid. An increase in the discount rate would reduce the APBO, while a reduction in the discount rate would increase the APBO. During the past several years, when interest rates have been at historically low levels, the discount rate used for our plans has declined from 7.25 for 2001 to 4.93 for 2022. This decline in the discount rate has resulted in an increase in our APBO. The Company s actuaries use several other assumptions that could have a significant impact on our APBO and periodic expense for these plans. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, expected rate of return on plan assets, future increases in medical and life insurance premiums, turnover rates of employees, and life expectancy. The accounting standards for postretirement plans involve mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility of earnings by allowing changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations to be amortized over time when actual results differ from the assumptions used, there are changes in the assumptions used, or there are plan amendments. At December 31, 2022, our employee pension plan had an unrecognized loss of 3.9 million. The medical and life insurance plan and non-employee director plan had unrecognized gains of 2.5 million and 1.0 million, respectively. The change in the discount rate, the pension plan s mortality table and the reduction in medical premiums are the only significant changes made to the assumptions used for these plans for each of the three years ended December 31, 2022. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the actual (loss) return on the employee pension plan assets was approximately (658 ), (154 ), and 311 , respectively, of the assumed return used to determine the periodic pension expense for that respective year. The market value of the assets of our employee pension plan is 19.1 million at December 31, 2022, which is 1.9 million more than the projected benefit obligation. We do not anticipate a change in the market value of these assets which would have a significant effect on liquidity, capital resources, or results of operations. At the time of the Bank s conversion from a federally chartered mutual savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank, the Bank was required by its primary regulator to establish a liquidation account which is reduced as and to the extent that eligible account holders reduce their qualifying deposits. Upon completion of the merger, the liquidation account was assumed by the Bank. The balance of the liquidation account at December 31, 2022 was 0.3 million. In the unlikely event of a complete liquidation of the Bank, each eligible account holder will be entitled to receive a distribution from the liquidation account. The Bank is not permitted to declare or pay a dividend or to repurchase any of its capital stock if the effect would be to cause the Bank s regulatory capital to be reduced below the amount required for the liquidation account but approval of the NYDFS Superintendent (the Superintendent is required if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years less prior dividends paid. The Holding Company is subject to the same regulatory restrictions on the declaration of dividends as the Bank. We have significant obligations that arise in the normal course of business. We finance our assets with deposits and borrowings. We also use borrowings to manage our interest-rate risk. Borrowings with call provisions are included in 
 65 

Table of Contents 
 the period of the next call date. We have the means to refinance these borrowings as they mature or are called through financing arrangements with the FHLB-NY and our ability to arrange repurchase agreements with broker-dealers and the FHLB-NY. (See Note 9 Deposits and Note 10 Borrowed Funds in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report. At December 31, 2022, we had borrowings obligations of 1,053.0 million of which 815.5 million represents our current obligations within one year. At December 31, 2022, we had deposit obligations of 6,485.3 million of which 5,818.6 million represents our current obligations within one year. At December 31, 2022, the Bank had 25 branches, which were all leased. In addition, we lease our executive offices. We currently outsource our data processing, loan servicing and check processing functions. We believe that this is the most cost effective method for obtaining these services. These arrangements are usually volume dependent and have varying terms. The contracts for these services usually include annual increases based on the increase in the consumer price index. At December 31, 2022, we had operating lease and purchasing obligations totaling 70.1 million. Pension and other postretirement benefits reflects our directors pension plan and amounts due under our plan for medical and life insurance benefits for retired employees. At December 31, 2022, we had pension and other postretirement benefits obligations totaling 5.4 million. We currently provide a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for officers who have achieved the designated level and completed one year of service. However, certain officers who have not reached the designated level but were already participants remain eligible to participate in the Plan. In addition to the amounts deferred by the officers, we match 50 of their contributions, generally up to a maximum of 5 of the officer s salary. These plans generally require the deferred balance to be credited with earnings at a rate earned by certain mutual funds. At December 31, 2022, we had deferred compensation plan obligations of 25.8 million. This expense is provided in the Consolidated Statements of Income, and the liability has been provided in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Regulatory Capital Position. Under applicable regulatory capital regulations, the Bank and the Company are required to comply with each of four separate capital adequacy standards: leverage capital, common equity Tier I risk-based capital, Tier I risk-based capital and total risk-based capital. Such classifications are used by the FDIC and other bank regulatory agencies to determine matters ranging from each institution s quarterly FDIC deposit insurance premium assessments, to approvals of applications authorizing institutions to grow their asset size or otherwise expand business activities. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank and the Company exceeded each of their four regulatory capital requirements. (See Note 15 Regulatory Capital of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.) Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statement in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting policies that require us to make significant judgments or estimates are described below. For more information on these critical accounting policies and other significant accounting policies, see the Note titled Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company s accounting policies are integral to understanding the results of operations and statement of financial condition. These policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Several of these policies require management s judgment to determine the value of the Company s assets and liabilities. The Company has established detailed written policies and control procedures to ensure consistent application of these policies. The Company has identified four accounting policies that require significant management valuation judgment: the allowance for credit losses, fair value of financial instruments, goodwill impairment and income taxes. Allowance for Credit Losses. An allowance for credit losses ACL is provided to absorb probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Management reviews the adequacy of the ACL by reviewing individual loans when it has disparate risk characteristics from the rest of the loan portfolio. These loans include non-accrual and troubled debt restructured TDR loans, while the remainder of the portfolio is grouped by categories with similar risk characteristics. The amount of the ACL is based upon a loss rate model that considers multiple factors which reflects management s 
 66 

Table of Contents 
 assessment of the credit quality of the loan portfolio. Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The factors are both quantitative and qualitative in nature including, but not limited to, historical losses, economic conditions, trends in delinquencies, value and adequacy of underlying collateral, volume and portfolio mix, and internal loan processes Judgment is required to determine how many years of historical loss experience are to be included when reviewing historical loss experience. A full credit cycle must be used, or loss estimates may be inaccurate. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available. The quantitative allowance is calculated using a number of inputs and assumptions. The process and guidelines were developed using, among other factors, the guidance from federal banking regulatory agencies and GAAP. The results of this process, support management s assessment as to the adequacy of the ACL at each balance sheet date. In determining the allowance for credit losses, assumptions are input for economic forecasts, baseline loss rates, prepayment rates, utilization rates for off-balance sheet commitments, and forecast and reversion periods. The allowance for credit losses is estimated utilizing internal and external data, information derived from historical events, current conditions, and economic forecasts. Historically observed credit loss experience adjusted for prepayment and macro-economic variables, provide the basis for the estimation of quantitatively modeled expected credit losses. The Company includes quantitative factors in the allowance model which include (1) amortized costs, (2) collective and individual loan evaluations, (3) contractual terms, (4) prepayments, (5) basis for credit loss estimates, (6) recoveries, (7) reasonable and supportable forecast assumptions, and (8) off balance sheet commitments. Notwithstanding the judgment required in assessing the components of the ACL, the Company believes that the ACL is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The policy has been applied on a consistent basis for all periods presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Notes 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and 4 Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The Company carries certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value under the fair value option. Fair value is considered the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The securities portfolio also consists of mortgage-backed and other securities for which the fair value election was not selected. These securities are classified as available for sale or held-to-maturity. Securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, with changes in fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Securities held-to-maturity are carried at their amortized cost in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Financial assets and financial liabilities reported at fair value are required to be measured based on the following alternatives: (1) quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments (Level 1), (2) significant other observable inputs (Level 2), or (3) significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). Judgment is required in selecting the appropriate level to be used to determine fair value. The majority of financial assets and financial liabilities for which the fair value election was made, and the majority of investments classified as available for sale and held-to-maturity, were measured using Level 2 inputs, which require judgment to determine the fair value. The trust preferred securities held in the investment portfolio, and the Company s junior subordinated debentures, were measured using Level 3 inputs due to the inactive market for these securities. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s trust preferred securities and junior subordinated debentures valued under Level 3 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, are the effective yields used in the cash flow models. Significant increases or decreases in the effective yield in isolation would results in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. See Notes 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ), 7 Securities and 20 Fair Value of Financial Instruments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Goodwill Impairment. Goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite life and is tested for impairment, rather than amortized, on at least an annual basis. For the purpose of goodwill impairment testing, management has concluded that 
 67 

Table of Contents 
 Company has one reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, there is no impairment of goodwill. Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are to be used as the basis for measurement, when available. Other acceptable valuation methods include an asset approach, which determines a fair value based upon the value of assets net of liabilities, an income approach, which determines fair value using one or more methods that convert anticipated economic benefits into a present single amount, and a market approach, which determines a fair value based on the similar businesses that have been sold. As described above, fair value of our reporting unit is derived using a combination of an asset approach, an income approach and a market approach. These valuation techniques consider several other factors beyond our market capitalization, such as the estimated future cash flows of our reporting unit, the discount rate used to present value such cash flows and the market multiples of comparable companies. Changes to input assumptions used in the analysis could result in materially different evaluations of goodwill impairment. See Notes 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Income Taxes. The Company estimates its income taxes payable based on the amounts it expects to owe to the various taxing authorizes (i.e., federal, state and local). In estimating income taxes, management assesses the relative merits and risks of the tax treatment of transactions, taking into account statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the Company s tax position. Management also relies on tax opinions, recent audits, and historical experience. The Company also recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. A valuation allowance is required for deferred tax assets that the Company estimates are more likely than not to be unrealizable, based on evidence available at the time the estimate is made. These estimates can be affected by changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates, and future income levels.

Accordingly, the Company assumes a zero loss expectation from the Fannie Mae security. At December 31, 2021, the Company s portfolio was made up of securities: which is structured similar to a commercial owner occupied loan, and modeled for credit losses similar to commercial business loans secured by real estate; the second is under forbearance and is individually evaluated for allowance for credit loss; and the third issued and guaranteed by Fannie Mae, which is a government sponsored enterprise that has a credit rating and perceived credit risk comparable to the U.S. government.

If the Company evaluates any decline in the fair value is due to credit loss factors and this valuation indicates that a credit loss exists, then the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security is compared to the amortized cost basis of security. If the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. The Company recorded tax exempt interest income totaling million during both years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The accrual of income on loans is generally discontinued when certain factors, such as contractual delinquency of 90 days or more, indicate reasonable doubt as to the timely collectability of such income. Uncollected interest previously recognized on non-accrual loans is reversed from interest income at the time the loan is placed on non-accrual status. A non-accrual loan can be returned to accrual status when contractual delinquency returns to less than 90 days delinquent. Payments received on non-accrual loans that do not bring the loan to less than 90 days delinquent are recorded on a cash basis. Payments can also be applied first as a reduction of principal until all principal is recovered and then subsequently to interest, if in management s opinion, it is evident that recovery of all principal due is likely to occur. The Company recognizes a loan as non-performing when the borrower has demonstrated the inability to bring the loan current, or due to other circumstances which, in management s opinion, indicate the borrower will be unable to bring the loan current within a reasonable time. All loans classified as non-performing, which includes all loans past due 90 days or more, are classified as non-accrual unless the loan is well secured and there is, in our opinion, compelling

Once the Company has decided to sell a loan, the sale usually closes in a short period of time, generally within the same quarter. Loans designated held for sale are reclassified from loans held for investment to loans held for sale. At the time of transfer, loans are written down to their fair value by recording a charge-off to the allowance for credit losses. Terms of sale include cash due upon the closing of the sale, no contingencies or recourse to the Company and servicing is released to the buyer. Additionally, at times the Company may sell participating interests in performing loans.

 (1) Includes million, and million of SBA Payment Protection Program SBA PPP loans at December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The majority of our loan portfolio is invested in multi-family residential, commercial real estate and commercial business and other loans, which totaled and of our gross loans at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our concentration in these types of loans increases the overall level of credit risk inherent in our loan portfolio. The greater risk associated with these types of loans could require us to increase our allowance and provision for credit losses and to maintain an ACL as a percentage of total loans in excess of the allowance currently maintained. In addition to our loan portfolio, at December 31, 2022, we were servicing million of loans for others. Loans secured by multi-family residential property and commercial real estate generally involve a greater degree of risk than residential mortgage loans and generally carry larger loan balances. The increased credit risk is the result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a smaller number of loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic conditions on income producing properties and the increased difficulty in evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Furthermore, the repayments of loans secured by these types of properties are typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related property, which is usually owned by a legal entity with the property being the entity s only asset. If the cash flow from the property is reduced, the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. If the borrower defaults, our only remedy may be to foreclose on the property, for which the market value may be less than the balance due on the related mortgage loan. Loans secured by commercial business and other loans involve a greater degree of risk for the same reasons as for multi-family residential and commercial real estate loans with the added risk that many of the loans are not secured by improved properties. To minimize the risks involved in the origination of multi-family residential, commercial real estate and commercial business and other loans, the Company adheres to defined underwriting standards, which include reviewing the expected net operating income generated by the real estate collateral securing the loan, the age and condition of the collateral, the financial resources and income level of the borrower and the borrower s experience in owning or managing similar properties. We typically require debt service coverage of at least of the monthly loan payment. We generally originate these loans up to a maximum of of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property, whichever is less. Any loan with a final loan-to-value ratio in excess of must be approved by the Bank s Board of Directors or the Loan Committee as an exception to policy. We generally rely on the income generated by the property as the primary means by which the loan is repaid. However, personal guarantees may be obtained for additional security from these borrowers. Additionally, for commercial business and other loans which are not secured by improved properties, the Bank will secure these loans with business assets, including accounts receivables, inventory and real estate and generally require personal guarantees.

We designate a loan as Substandard when a well-defined weakness is identified that may jeopardize the orderly liquidation of the debt. We designate a loan Doubtful when it displays the inherent weakness of a Substandard loan with the added provision that collection of the debt in full, on the basis of existing facts, is highly improbable. We designate a loan as Loss if it is deemed the debtor is incapable of repayment. The Company does not hold any loans designated as Loss, as loans that are designated as Loss are charged to the Allowance for Credit Losses.

Commitments in process reflect loans not on the Company s books but rather negotiated loan / line of credit terms and rates that the Company has offered to customers and is committed to honoring. In reference to in process credits, the Company defines an unfunded commitment as a credit that has been offered to and accepted by a borrower, which has not closed and by which the obligation is not unconditionally cancellable. The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the company is exposed to credit risk through a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The Company uses similar assumptions and risk factors that are developed for collectively evaluated financing receivables. This estimates includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments to be funded over its estimated life. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, allowance for off-balance-sheet credit losses was million and million, respectively, which is included in the Other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.

 million and million, respectively. At December 31, 2021, the Company carried financial assets and financial liabilities under the fair value option with fair values of million and million, respectively. The Company did not purchase or sell any financial assets or liabilities under the fair value option during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Management selected the fair value option for certain investment securities, and certain borrowed funds as the yield, at the time of election, on the financial assets was below-market, while the rate on the financial liabilities was above-market rate. Management also considered the average duration of these instruments, which, for investment securities, was longer than the average for the portfolio of securities, and, for borrowings, primarily represented the longer-term borrowings of the Company. Choosing these instruments for the fair value option adjusted the carrying value of these financial assets and financial liabilities to their current fair value, and more closely aligned the financial performance of the Company with the economic value of these financial instruments. Management believed that electing the fair value option for these financial assets and financial liabilities allows them to better react to changes in interest rates. At the time of election, Management did not elect the fair value option for investment securities and borrowings with shorter duration, adjustable-rates, and yields that approximated the then current market rate, as management believed that these financial assets and financial liabilities approximated their economic value.

 Sales approach Reduction for planned expedited disposal to Certain delinquent loans Discounted Cashflow Discount Rate Probability of Default The Company did t have any liabilities that were carried at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The methods and assumptions used to estimate fair value at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows: Securities: The fair values of securities are contained in Note 7 Securities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities and adjusted for differences between the quoted instrument and the instrument being valued. When there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the valuation, securities are valued using discounted cash flows. Certain Delinquent Loans: For certain delinquent loans, fair value is generally estimated by discounting management s estimate of future cash flows with a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with such assets or, for collateral dependent loans, of the appraised or internally estimated value of the property. Other Real Estate Owned and Other Repossessed Assets: The fair value for OREO is based on appraised value through a current appraisal, or sometimes through an internal review, additionally adjusted by the estimated costs to sell the property. The fair value for other repossessed assets are based upon the most recently reported arm s length sales transaction. When there is no recent sale activity, the fair value is calculated using capitalization rates. Junior Subordinated Debentures: The fair value of the junior subordinated debentures was developed using a credit spread based on the subordinated debt issued by the Company adjusting for differences in the junior subordinated debt s credit rating, liquidity and time to maturity. The unrealized net gain/loss attributable to changes in our own credit risk was determined by adjusting the fair value as determined in the proceeding sentence by the average rate of default on debt instruments with a similar debt rating as our junior subordinated debentures, with the difference from the original calculation and this calculation resulting in the instrument-specific unrealized gain/loss. Interest Rate Swaps: The fair value of interest rate swaps is based upon broker quotes.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, derivatives with a combined notional amount of million and million were designated as fair value hedges. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, derivatives with a combined notional amount of million and million, respectively, were designated as cash flow hedges. For cash flow hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivative is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged forecasted transaction effects earnings. During the year ended December 31, 2022, million was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest expense.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and our report dated March 14, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

 Allowance for Credit losses As described in Notes 2 and 4 to the Company s consolidated financial statements, the Company had a gross loan portfolio of 6.9 billion and related allowance for credit losses of 40.4 million as of December 31, 2022. The allowance for credit losses consists of quantitative and qualitative components. The Company considers historical loss experience, current economic and business conditions, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts to develop the quantitative component. This quantitative component is then adjusted for qualitative risk factors. These components involve significant estimates and assumptions that require a high degree of management s judgment. We identified the significant assumptions used to develop the quantitative component of the allowance, including the reasonable and supportable forecast period, and the reversion to historical loss period; and, the assumptions around the determination of qualitative risk factors as a critical audit matter. Auditing these assumptions involved especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit evidence and effort required to address these matters, including the extent of specialized skill and knowledge needed. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: 
 Testing the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to determination of reasonable and supportable forecast period, and reversion to historical loss period, as well as assumptions around the determination of qualitative risk factors. Testing the completeness and accuracy of the input data used in determining the qualitative risk factors and evaluating the sources of data used, considering contradictory evidence, in developing the quantitative component. Assessing the reasonableness of the qualitative risk factors using corroborating and contradictory source data to challenge management s qualitative risk factors. Utilizing personnel with specialized skill and knowledge in valuation to assist with evaluating the appropriateness of economic cycle, the reasonable and supportable forecast period, and the reversion to historical loss period assumptions used to develop the quantitative component. /S/ We have served as the Company s auditor since 2015.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /S/ BDO USA, LLP New York, New York March 14, 2023

Exhibit 10.17 Flushing Financial Corporation FFC Annual Incentive Plan for Executives and Senior Officers 1) Purpose The purpose of the Annual Incentive Plan is to provide annual incentive payments to Executives and Senior Officers who contribute to the successful performance of Flushing Financial Corporation (the Bank during the year. 2) Funding The program will be funded as a portion of a pool of pre-tax Net Income. The CEO recommends and the Compensation Committee (the Committee approves the pre-tax performance required to fund the Bank s annual incentive pool; funding levels will include: - A threshold level of performance required to fund the pool; performance below threshold will result in no funding of the pool, and no annual incentive being paid to Senior Officers; - Target and stretch target levels of performance; and, - A maximum level of performance that will be considered to fund the pool; performance beyond the maximum will result in no additional funding of the pool. The pool will be divided into two parts, in portions to be determined by the Compensation Committee (the Committee and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) - One portion of the pool funds annual incentive awards to Senior Officers, as discussed in this document; and, - The other portion of the pool funds annual incentive awards to Vice Presidents and other eligible employees who are not eligible for any other incentive plans of the Bank, as determined by the CEO, to be addressed in a separate document. 3) Eligibility Eligibility for annual incentive payments under this plan is limited to Senior Officers defined as President/CEO, Senior Executive Vice Presidents, Executive Vice President, and Senior Vice Presidents I II. 4) Performance Measures Before or shortly after the commencement of the fiscal year, but not later than the 90 th day of the fiscal year, the CEO recommends and the Committee approves performance measures for the determination of annual incentive payments to Senior Officers. Performance measures may be established to measure performance versus internally-derived goals, external comparisons to a peer group, or a combination of the internally-derived goals and external comparisons, as defined in the Bank s 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Performance measures for the CEO and Senior Executive Vice Presidents without direct departmental Profit Loss (P L) responsibility are based on the overall Bank performance. Performance measures for Executive Vice Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents without direct departmental Profit Loss (P L) responsibility are based on the overall Bank performance and department specific management by objectives. At the recommendation of the CEO, and with the approval of the Committee, performance measures for Senior Officers with direct departmental P L responsibility may be based on a combination of Bank and Departmental performance. 
 1 

5) Targets and Awards Determinations of award targets and actual awards for Senior Officers are typically based solely on actual performance versus pre-established performance measures and, for Senior Officers named in the proxy (Named Officers), are structured so as to comply for with the criteria under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as discussed in the Bank s 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan. - For the CEO, targets and awards (i.e., Threshold, Target, Stretch Target and Maximum) are developed by the Committee and approved by the Board - For the other Senior Officers, targets and awards are recommended by the CEO and approved by the Committee - The Committee has the discretion to reduce, but not to increase, payment levels from established targets The 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan also permits the Committee to grant awards to Named Officers (and all Senior Officers) that are discretionary and not structured to be compliant with the criteria under Section 162(m) 1 . 6) Payment Payment will be typically made in cash, as soon as possible after Committee approval and no later than 75 days after the close of the fiscal year. Unless otherwise provided below or in an individual employment agreement, to receive payment a Senior Officer must be actively employed and in good standing on the date of payment. Subject to the Committee s discretion to reduce (but not increase) any amount payable in respect of awards as set forth in the Bank s 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan, in the event of the Officer s termination of employment prior to the payment date on account of death, disability, retirement or termination by the Bank without cause, the Senior Officer shall be entitled to receive: (i) the earned but unpaid bonus for the year prior to the year of termination, which shall be paid at the same time as bonuses for such year are paid to active employees; and (ii) a pro rata portion of the Officer s bonus for the year of termination determined by multiplying the amount of the bonus which would have been earned by the Officer for the year of termination if the Officer had remained in employment through the end of the year (but only to the extent of achievement of the applicable performance standards for such year) by the number of full months of employment during the year of termination, and dividing by 12, which amount shall be paid at the same time as bonuses for such year are paid to active employees. 7) Additional Discussion The Annual Incentive Plan is governed by the provisions of the shareholder-approved 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Each year a schedule shall be developed by the CEO and approved by the Committee regarding for that fiscal year: - The funding of the overall Bank s annual incentive pool, including the portioning of the overall pool, as discussed above; and, - Performance measures and payment targets for Senior Officers 
 1 For example, the Committee may choose to grant discretionary awards in the cases of: (i) not attaining an Earnings per Share metric due to an unplanned acquisition; and/or (ii) not attaining a Return on Assets metric due to a balance sheet restructuring these may be further defined. 

Each year a schedule regarding the CEO s performance measures and annual incentive targets for that fiscal year shall be developed and recommended by the Committee and approved by the Board.

Exhibit A Performance Goals The PRSUs shall be earned, if at all, based on the achievement of the following two equally weighted Performance Goals during the Performance Period (i.e., the three-year period from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025), as determined by the Committee in its absolute and sole discretion: Total Charge-offs Weighted at 50 of Target PRSU award Below Threshold Threshold Target Maximum 

Total Charge-offs above 0.23 0.23 0.20 0.17 Earned PRSUs 0 50 100 150 
 Total Charge-offs means the net loans charged-off for the three year period divided by average loans over the same three year period. PRSUs will be earned at the target-level for this metric if for the three-year Performance Period, Total Charge-offs are 20 basis points. Increase Tangible Book Value per Share Weighted at 50 of Target PRSU award Below Threshold Threshold Target Maximum Increase Tangible Book Value per Share below 10.40 10.40 13.00 14.30 Earned PRSUs 0 50 100 150 
 Increase Tangible Book Value means the increase in tangible book value for the three-year Performance Period. PRSUs will be earned at the target-level for this metric if the Tangible Book Value increases 13.00 over the three-year Performance Period. Performance below the threshold-level during the Performance Period results in no PRSUs being earned with respect to the applicable Performance Goal. Performance above the maximum-level results in no more than the maximum PRSUs being earned with respect to the applicable Performance Goal. Performance between the threshold-level and maximum-level will be calculated using linear interpolation.

request and your failure or refusal to do so will entitle the Company to an inference that you have violated or intend to violate the non-solicitation provisions set forth in this Agreement. You acknowledge that in carrying out the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, you may learn confidential or proprietary information about the Company and its subsidiaries or third parties. Confidential or proprietary information includes, among other things, any nonpublic information concerning the Company or its subsidiaries, including their respective business, financial performance, marketing or strategic plans, customers, and product pricing information, as well as any nonpublic information provided by a third party with the expectation that the information will be kept confidential and used solely for the business purpose for which it was conveyed (collectively, Confidential Information ).

If, at any time, the provisions of this Section 11 shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable, by reason of being vague or unreasonable as to area, duration or scope of activity, this Section 11 shall be considered divisible and shall become and be immediately amended to only such area, duration and scope of activity as shall be determined to be reasonable and enforceable by the court or other body having jurisdiction over the matter; and you agree that this Section 11 as so amended shall be valid and binding as though any invalid or unenforceable provision had not been included herein.

In the event of a breach or a threatened breach by you of any of the terms of this Section 11, the Company will be entitled to an injunction restraining you from such breach or threatened breach (without the necessity of providing the inadequacy as a remedy of money damages or the posting of bond); provided, however, that the right to injunctive relief will not be construed as prohibiting the Company from pursuing any other available remedies, whether at law or in equity, for such breach or threatened breach. In addition to any other rights or remedies available to the Company, any breach of these restrictions will result in an immediate forfeiture of your award and shall entitle the Company to recover any shares of Common Stock previously delivered to you and to recover the proceeds from the sale or disposition of any such shares.
