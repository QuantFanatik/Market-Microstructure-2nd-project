 Re: Corporate Backed Trust Certificates, Goldman Sachs Capital I Securities-Backed Series 2004-6 Trust (the Trust Ladies
and Gentlemen: We have examined assertions of SCS LABS Corporation (formerly known
as Lehman ABS Corporation), (the Depositor and U.S. Bank Trust National Association, (the Trustee and, together with the Depositor, the Management that the Depositor and the Trustee have complied, in all
material respects, with the provisions of the Standard Terms for Trust Agreements dated as of January 16, 200 I, as supplemented by a series supplement dated as of March 19, 2004 (together, the Trust Agreement in respect of
the Corporate Backed Trust Certificates, Goldman Sachs Capital I Securities-Backed Series 2004-6 Trust (the Trust ), during the period covered by the annual report on
 Form 10-K filed by the Depositor on behalf of the Trust for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the Annual Report ). Management is responsible for compliance with the Trust Agreement. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on Management s assertions based on our examination. 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Depositor and the Trustee have complied with the Trust Agreement during the period covered by the Annual Report and Management s assertions with
respect to such compliance are fairly stated, in all material respects. An examination involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about management s assertion. The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of Management s assertion whether due to fraud or error, and performing such other procedures as considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that the evidence
we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Up to August 2022, the Depositor was a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
which filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York on September 15, 2008. On December 6, 2011, the Bankruptcy Court
entered an order confirming the Modified Third Amended Chapter 11 Plan of Lehman Brothers Holdings lnc. and its Affiliated Debtors (the Plan ). And, on March 6, 2012, the Plan became effective and a notice of the Effective Date of the
Plan was filed with the Bankruptcy Court. From August 2022, the Depositor, SCS LABS Corporation (formerly known as Lehman ABS Corporation) is no longer a
subsidiary of Lehman Brother Holdings Inc., LBHI ). In addition, The Trust assets are held by the Trustee through an account at the
Depository Trust Company. No liens, encumbrances, or adverse interests have been placed upon the assets of the Trust. In our opinion, the Depositor and
the Trustee have complied, in all material respects, with the Trust Agreement during the period covered by the Annual Report and Management s assertions with respect to such compliance are fairly stated, in all material respects, for the year
ended December 31, 2022.
