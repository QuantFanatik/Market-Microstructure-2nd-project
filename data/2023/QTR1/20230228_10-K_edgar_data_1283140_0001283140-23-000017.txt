Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 Holly Energy Partners, L.P. HEP is a Delaware limited partnership engaged principally in the business of operating a system of petroleum product and crude pipelines, storage tanks, distribution terminals and loading rack facilities in Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming and refinery processing units in Utah and Kansas. We were formed in Delaware in 2004 and maintain our principal corporate offices at 2828 N. Harwood, Suite 1300, Dallas, Texas 75201-1507. Our telephone number is 214-871-3555 and our internet website address is www.hollyenergy.com . The information contained on our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A copy of this Annual Report on Form 10-K will be provided without charge upon written request to the Vice President, Investor Relations at the above address. A direct link to our filings at the SEC website is available on our website on the Investors page. Also available on our website are copies of our Governance Guidelines, Audit Committee Charter, Compensation Committee Charter, and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, all of which will be provided without charge upon written request to the Vice President, Investor Relations at the above address. In this document, the words we, our, ours and us refer to HEP and its consolidated subsidiaries or to HEP or an individual subsidiary and not to any other person. HF Sinclair refers to HF Sinclair Corporation and its subsidiaries, excluding HEP and its subsidiaries and Holly Logistic Services, L.L.C. HLS ), a subsidiary of HF Sinclair that is the ultimate general partner of HEP and manages HEP. 
 
 On March 14, 2022 (the Closing Date ), HollyFrontier Corporation HFC and HEP announced the establishment of HF Sinclair Corporation, a Delaware corporation HF Sinclair ), as the new parent holding company of HFC and HEP and their subsidiaries, and the completion of their respective acquisitions of Sinclair Oil Corporation (now known as Sinclair Oil LLC Sinclair Oil )) and Sinclair Transportation Company LLC Sinclair Transportation from The Sinclair Companies (now known as REH Company and referred to herein as REH Company ). On the Closing Date, pursuant to that certain Business Combination Agreement, dated as of August 2, 2021 (as amended on March 14, 2022, the Business Combination Agreement ), by and among HFC, HF Sinclair, Hippo Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of HF Sinclair Parent Merger Sub ), REH Company, and Hippo Holding LLC (now known as Sinclair Holding LLC), a wholly owned subsidiary of REH Company (the Target Company ), HF Sinclair completed its acquisition of the Target Company by effecting (a) a holding company merger in accordance with Section 251(g) of the Delaware General Corporation Law whereby HFC merged with and into Parent Merger Sub, with HFC surviving such merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of HF Sinclair (the HFC Merger ), and (b) immediately following the HFC Merger, a contribution whereby REH Company contributed all of the equity interests of the Target Company to HF Sinclair in exchange for shares of HF Sinclair, resulting in the Target Company becoming a direct wholly owned subsidiary of HF Sinclair (together with the HFC Merger, the HFC Transactions ). 
 
 Additionally, on the Closing Date and immediately prior to consummation of the HFC Transactions, HEP acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Sinclair Transportation from REH Company in exchange for 21 million newly issued common limited partner units of HEP (the HEP Units ), representing 16.6 of the pro forma outstanding HEP Units with a value of approximately 349 million based on HEP s fully diluted common limited partner units outstanding and closing unit price on March 11, 2022, and cash consideration equal to 329.0 million, inclusive of final working capital adjustments for an aggregate transaction value of 678.0 million (the HEP Transaction and together with the HFC Transactions, the Sinclair Transactions ). The cash consideration was funded through a draw under HEP s senior secured revolving credit facility. The HEP Transaction was conditioned on the closing of the HFC Transactions, which occurred immediately following the HEP Transaction. 
 
 Sinclair Transportation, together with its subsidiaries, owned REH Company s integrated crude and refined products pipelines and terminal assets, including approximately 1,200 miles of integrated crude and refined product pipeline supporting the REH Company refineries and other third-party refineries, eight product terminals and two crude terminals with approximately 4.5 million barrels of operated storage. In addition, HEP acquired Sinclair Transportation s interests in three pipeline joint ventures for crude gathering and product offtake including: Saddle Butte Pipeline III, LLC (25.06 non-operated interest); Pioneer Investments Corp. (49.995 non-operated interest); and UNEV Pipeline, LLC ("UNEV") (the 25 non-operated interest not already owned by HEP, resulting in UNEV becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of HEP). 
 
 References herein to HEP with respect to time periods prior to March 14, 2022, include HEP and its consolidated subsidiaries and do not include Sinclair Transportation and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the HEP Acquired Sinclair Businesses ). References herein to HEP with respect to time periods from and after March 14, 2022 include the operations of the HEP Acquired Sinclair Businesses. 
 
 References herein to HF Sinclair Corporation HF Sinclair with respect to time periods prior to March 14, 2022 refer to HFC and its consolidated subsidiaries and do not include the Target Company, Sinclair Transportation or their respective consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the HFS Acquired Sinclair Businesses ). References herein to HF Sinclair with respect 
 - 7 - 

to time periods from and after March 14, 2022 refer to HF Sinclair and its consolidated subsidiaries, which include the operations of the combined business operations of HFC and the HFS Acquired Sinclair Businesses. 
 Through our subsidiaries and joint ventures we own and/or operate petroleum product and crude pipelines, terminal, tankage and loading rack facilities, and refinery processing units that support the refining and marketing operations of HF Sinclair and other refineries in the Mid-Continent, Southwest and Northwest regions of the United States. At December 31, 2022, HF Sinclair owned approximately 47 of our outstanding common units as well as a non-economic general partner interest. Our assets are categorized into a Pipelines and Terminals segment and a Refinery Processing Unit segment. Segment disclosures are discussed in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. 
 We generate revenues by charging tariffs for transporting petroleum products and crude oil through our pipelines, by charging fees for terminalling and storing refined products and other hydrocarbons, providing other services at our storage tanks and terminals and charging a tolling fee per barrel or thousand standard cubic feet of feedstock throughput in our refinery processing units. We do not take ownership of products that we transport, terminal, store or process, and therefore, we are not directly exposed to changes in commodity prices. 
 We have a long-term strategic relationship with HF Sinclair that has historically facilitated our growth. Our future growth plans include organic projects around our existing assets and select investments or acquisitions that enhance our service platform while creating accretion for our unitholders. While in the near term, any acquisitions would be subject to the economic conditions discussed in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview , we also expect over the longer term to continue to work with HF Sinclair on logistic asset acquisitions in conjunction with HF Sinclair s refinery acquisition strategies. 
 
 PIPELINES AND TERMINALS 
 
 Pipelines 
 
 Our refined product pipelines transport light refined products from HF Sinclair s Navajo refinery in New Mexico and a third party's refinery in Texas to their customers in the metropolitan and rural areas of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, and from various refineries in Utah, Wyoming, and Montana (including HF Sinclair's Woods Cross refinery in Utah, Parco refinery in Sinclair, Wyoming, and Casper refinery in Casper, Wyoming) to Nevada, Utah and Colorado. We also have a product pipeline that transports light refined products from Olathe, Kansas to Carrollton, Missouri and Montrose, Iowa. The refined products transported in these pipelines include conventional gasolines, federal, state and local specification reformulated gasoline, low-octane gasoline for oxygenate blending, distillates that include high- and low-sulfur diesel and jet fuel and liquefied petroleum gases LPGs (such as propane, butane and isobutane). 
 
 Our intermediate product pipelines consist principally of three parallel pipelines that connect the Navajo refinery, Lovington and Artesia facilities. These pipelines primarily transport intermediate feedstocks and crude oil for HF Sinclair s refining operations in New Mexico. We also own pipelines that transport intermediate product and gas between HF Sinclair's Tulsa East and West refinery facilities, and between HF Sinclair's Casper and Parco refineries. 
 
 Our crude pipelines consist of crude oil trunk, gathering and connection pipelines located in West Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming that deliver crude oil to HF Sinclair's Navajo, El Dorado, Tulsa, Woods Cross, Parco and Casper refineries as well as other unaffiliated refineries. 
 
 Our pipelines are regularly inspected. Generally, other than as may be provided in certain pipelines and terminal agreements, substantially all of our pipelines are unrestricted as to the direction in which product flows and the types of crude and refined products that we can transport on them. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC regulates the transportation tariffs for interstate shipments on our refined product and crude oil pipelines and state regulatory agencies regulate the transportation tariffs for intrastate shipments on our pipelines. 
 
 HF Sinclair shipped an aggregate of 79 of the petroleum products transported on our refined product pipelines, 100 of the throughput volumes transported on our intermediate pipelines, and 76 of the throughput on our crude pipelines in 2022. 
 
 The following table details the average aggregate daily number of barrels of petroleum products transported on our pipelines in each of the periods set forth below for HF Sinclair and for third parties.

Terminals, Loading Racks and Refinery and Renewable Diesel Facility Tankage 
 
 Our refined product terminals receive products from pipelines connected to HF Sinclair s refineries and other third party refineries. We then distribute them to HF Sinclair and third parties, who in turn deliver them to end-users and retail outlets. Our terminals are generally complementary to our pipeline assets and serve the marketing activities of HF Sinclair and other customers. Terminals play a key role in moving product to the end-user market by providing the following services: 
 distribution; 
 blending to achieve specified grades of gasoline and diesel, including the blending of butane, ethanol and biodiesel; 
 other ancillary services that include the injection of additives and filtering of jet fuel; and 
 storage and inventory management. 
 
 Typically, our refined product terminal facilities consist of multiple storage tanks and are equipped with automated truck loading equipment that operates 24 hours a day. This automated system provides for control of security, allocations, and credit and carrier certification by remote input of data by our customers. In addition, nearly all of our terminals are equipped with truck loading racks capable of providing automated blending to individual customer specifications. 
 
 Our refined product terminals derive most of their revenues from terminalling fees paid by customers. We charge a fee for transferring refined products from the terminal to trucks or to pipelines connected to the terminal. In addition to terminalling fees, we generate revenues by charging our customers fees for storage, blending, injecting additives, and filtering jet fuel. HF Sinclair currently accounts for the substantial majority of our refined product terminal revenues. 
 
 Our crude terminals receives crude from crude pipelines and truck offloading racks owned by us and third-parties and derive most of their revenues from throughput charges. 
 
 The table below sets forth the total average throughput for our refined product and crude terminals in each of the periods presented:

CONTROL OPERATIONS OF PIPELINES AND TERMINALS 
 
 All of our pipelines are operated via satellite, microwave and radio systems from our central control room located in Artesia, New Mexico. We also monitor activity at our terminals from this control room. The control center operates with state-of-the-art Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition, or SCADA, systems. Our control center is equipped with computer systems designed to continuously monitor operational data, including refined product and crude oil throughput, flow rates, and pressures. In addition, the control center monitors alarms and throughput balances. The control center operates remote pumps, motors, engines, and valves associated with the delivery of refined products and crude oil. The computer systems are designed to enhance leak-detection capabilities, sound automatic alarms if operational conditions outside of pre-established parameters occur, and provide for remote-controlled shutdown of pump stations on the pipelines. 
 
 REFINERY PROCESSING UNITS 
 
 Our refinery processing units are integrated in HF Sinclair's El Dorado, Kansas refinery and HF Sinclair's Woods Cross, Utah refinery and are used to support their daily operations, which chemically transform crude oil into various petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel, LPGs and asphalt. 
 
 HF Sinclair has committed to supply these units with a minimum feedstock throughput for each calendar quarter. HEP has committed that these units yield a certain level of petroleum product. The initial terms for the refinery processing units at HF Sinclair's El Dorado and Woods Cross refineries extend through 2030 and 2031, respectively. 
 
 The El Dorado units were first operational in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and the Woods Cross units were first operational in the second quarter of 2016. These units operate on a daily basis until they are taken down for large-scale maintenance, which can be every two to four years and could last from two to four weeks. During this maintenance period (turnaround), the minimum feedstock throughput is adjusted so that HF Sinclair is not penalized for HEP's maintenance requirements. 
 
 HEP's revenue is primarily generated from the minimum throughput commitments, and HEP charges a tolling fee per barrel or thousand standard cubic feet of throughput. The tolling fee is meant to provide HEP with revenue that surpasses the amount of its expected operating costs, which include natural gas and maintenance. On any calendar month where the cost of natural gas exceeds what is included in the tolling fee, HEP will charge HF Sinclair for recovery of this additional cost. Additionally, if turnaround costs are more than expected after the first turnaround for each unit, the tolling fee will be permanently adjusted, one time, to recover these costs. 
 
 Our refinery processing units are managed by refinery personnel seconded from HF Sinclair; significant assets are grouped accordingly and described below. 
 
 El Dorado Refinery 
 
 Naphtha Fractionation Unit - El Dorado, Kansas refinery facility 
 The feedstock used by the naphtha fractionation unit is desulfurized naphtha, which is produced by the refinery earlier in the refining process. Desulfurized naphtha is a key component in gasoline, and this unit is used to reduce the level of benzene precursors. This allows the resulting product to be processed further to produce gasoline that meets regulatory requirements. The unit's feedstock capacity is 50,000 bpd of desulfurized naphtha. 
 
 - 18 - 

Hydrogen Generation Unit - El Dorado, Kansas refinery facility 
 The hydrogen unit primarily uses natural gas as a feedstock to produce hydrogen gas that is used in HF Sinclair's operation of its El Dorado, Kansas refinery. This feedstock is supplied from purchased natural gas. The hydrogen unit's natural gas feedstock capacity is 6,100 thousand standard cubic feet per day. 
 
 Woods Cross Refinery 
 
 Crude Unit - Woods Cross, Utah refinery facility 
 The crude unit is comprised of several components, primarily an atmospheric distillation tower, a desalter and heat exchangers, together referred to as the crude unit. The crude unit uses black wax and other crudes as feedstock and is the first step in the refining process to separate crude into refined products. This process is accomplished by heating the crude until it is distilled into various intermediate streams. These intermediate streams are further refined downstream of the crude unit. The initial rejection of major contaminants is also performed by the crude unit. Its feedstock capacity is 15,000 bpd of crude oil. 
 
 Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit - Woods Cross, Utah refinery facility 
 The fluid catalytic cracking unit FCC is used to convert the high-boiling, high-molecular weight hydrocarbon fractions of crude oil to more valuable products like gasoline, diesel and LPGs. This conversion is performed by the cracking of petroleum hydrocarbons achieved from extremely high temperatures and fluidized catalyst. The FCC's capacity is 8,000 bpd of atmospheric tower bottoms from the crude unit, discussed above, and gas oil. 
 
 Polymerization Unit - Woods Cross, Utah refinery facility 
 The polymerization unit uses the LPGs, propylene and butylene, from the FCC unit and polymerizes them into high octane gasoline blendstock using heat and catalysts. This gasoline blendstock is combined with other blendstocks in the refinery to make finished gasoline. The polymerization unit's feedstock capacity is 2,500 bpd. 
 
 INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURE 
 On October 2, 2019, HEP Cushing LLC HEP Cushing ), a wholly owned subsidiary of HEP, and Plains Marketing, L.P., a wholly owned subsidiary of Plains, formed a 50/50 joint venture, Cushing Connect Pipeline Terminal LLC (the Cushing Connect Joint Venture ), for (i) the development, construction, ownership and operation of a new 160,000 barrel per day common carrier crude oil pipeline (the Cushing Connect Pipeline that will connect the Cushing, Oklahoma crude oil hub to the Tulsa, Oklahoma refining complex owned by a subsidiary of HF Sinclair and (ii) the ownership and operation of 1.5 million barrels of crude oil storage in Cushing, Oklahoma (the Cushing Connect JV Terminal ). The Cushing Connect JV Terminal went in service during the second quarter of 2020, and the Cushing Connect Pipeline was placed into service at the end of the third quarter of 2021. Long-term commercial agreements have been entered into to support the Cushing Connect Joint Venture assets. 
 
 The Cushing Connect Joint Venture contracted with an affiliate of HEP to manage the construction and operation of the Cushing Connect Pipeline and with an affiliate of Plains to manage the operation of the Cushing Connect JV Terminal. The total Cushing Connect Joint Venture investment was generally shared equally among HEP and Plains. However, we were solely responsible for any Cushing Connect Pipeline construction costs that exceeded the budget by more than 10 . HEP's share of the cost of the Cushing Connect JV Terminal contributed by Plains and Cushing Connect Pipeline construction costs were approximately 74 million, including approximately 5 million of Cushing Connect Pipeline construction costs that exceeded the budget by more than 10 borne solely by HEP. 
 
 The investment above and the basis of presentation is described further in Note 3 in notes to consolidated financial statements of HEP, and the description in Note 3 is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 AGREEMENTS WITH HF SINCLAIR 
 
 We serve HF Sinclair's refineries under long-term pipeline, terminal, tankage and refinery processing unit throughput agreements expiring from 2023 to 2037. Under these agreements, HF Sinclair agrees to transport, store, and process throughput volumes of refined products, crude oil and feedstocks on our pipelines, terminal, tankage, loading rack facilities and refinery processing units that result in minimum annual payments to us. These minimum annual payments or revenues are subject to annual rate adjustments on July 1st each year based on the PPI or the FERC index. As of December 31, 2022, our agreements with HF Sinclair required minimum annualized payments to us of 453 million. 
 If HF Sinclair fails to meet its minimum volume commitments under the agreements in any quarter, it will be required to pay us the amount of any shortfall in cash by the last day of the month following the end of the quarter. Under certain of the agreements, a shortfall payment may be applied as a credit in the following four quarters after minimum obligations are met. 
 A significant reduction in revenues under these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 - 19 - 

Furthermore, if new laws or regulations that affect terminals or pipelines are enacted that require us to make substantial and unanticipated capital expenditures at the pipelines or terminals, we will have the right after we have made efforts to mitigate their effects to negotiate a monthly surcharge on HF Sinclair for the use of the terminals or to file for an increased tariff rate for use of the pipelines to cover HF Sinclair s pro rata portion of the cost of complying with these laws or regulations including a reasonable rate of return. In such instances, we will negotiate in good faith with HF Sinclair to agree on the level of the monthly surcharge or increased tariff rate. 
 On June 1, 2020, HFC announced plans to permanently cease petroleum refining operations at its Cheyenne refinery(the "Cheyenne Refinery") and to convert certain assets at that refinery to renewable diesel production. HFC subsequently began winding down petroleum refining operations at the Cheyenne Refinery on August 3, 2020. 
 On February 8, 2021, HEP and HFC finalized and executed new agreements for HEP s Cheyenne assets with the following terms, in each case effective January 1, 2021: (1) a ten-year lease with two five-year renewal option periods for HFC s (and now HF Sinclair s) use of certain HEP tank and rack assets in the Cheyenne Refinery to facilitate renewable diesel production with an annual lease payment of approximately 5 million, (2) a five-year contango service fee arrangement that will utilize HEP tank assets inside the Cheyenne Refinery where HFC (and now HF Sinclair) will pay a base tariff to HEP for available crude oil storage and HFC (and now HF Sinclair) and HEP will split any profits generated on crude oil contango opportunities and (3) HFC paid a 10 million one-time cash payment to HEP for the termination of the existing minimum volume commitment. 
 Omnibus Agreement 
 Under certain provisions of an omnibus agreement we have with HF Sinclair (the Omnibus Agreement ), we pay HF Sinclair an annual administrative fee, currently 5.0 million, for the provision by HF Sinclair or its affiliates of various general and administrative services to us. This fee includes expenses incurred by HF Sinclair to perform centralized corporate functions, such as executive management, legal, accounting, treasury, information technology and other corporate services, including the administration of employee benefit plans. In connection with the HEP Transaction, we paid HF Sinclair a temporary monthly fee of 62,500 through November 30, 2022, relating to transition services provided to HEP by HF Sinclair. Neither the annual administrative fee nor the temporary monthly fee includes the salaries of personnel employed by HF Sinclair who perform services for us on behalf of HLS or the cost of their employee benefits, which are separately charged to us by HF Sinclair. We also reimburse HF Sinclair and its affiliates for direct expenses they incur on our behalf. In addition, we also pay for our own direct general and administrative costs, including costs relating to operating as a separate publicly held entity, such as costs for preparation of partners K-1 tax information, SEC filings, directors compensation, and registrar and transfer agent fees. 
 
 Under HLS s secondment agreement with HF Sinclair (the Secondment Agreement ), certain employees of HF Sinclair are seconded to HLS, our ultimate general partner, to provide operational and maintenance services for certain of our processing, refining, pipeline and tankage assets, and HLS reimburses HF Sinclair for its prorated portion of the wages, benefits, and other costs of these employees for our benefit. 
 COMPETITION 
 As a result of our physical integration with HF Sinclair s refineries, our contractual relationship with HF Sinclair under the Omnibus Agreement and the HF Sinclair pipelines and terminals, tankage and throughput agreements, we believe that we will not face significant competition for barrels of crude oil transported to or refined products transported from HF Sinclair s refineries, particularly during the terms of our long-term transportation agreements with HF Sinclair expiring between 2023 and 2037. 
 However, we do face competition from other pipelines that may be able to supply the end-user markets of HF Sinclair or other customers with refined products on a more competitive basis. Additionally, if HF Sinclair s wholesale customers reduced their purchases of refined products due to the increased availability of cheaper product from other suppliers, decreased demand for refined products or for other reasons, the volumes transported through our pipelines could be reduced, which, subject to the minimum revenue commitments, could cause a decrease in cash and revenues generated from our operations. 
 The petroleum refining business is highly competitive. Among HF Sinclair s competitors are some of the world s largest integrated petroleum companies, which have their own crude oil supplies and distribution and marketing systems. HF Sinclair competes with independent refiners as well. Competition in particular geographic areas is affected primarily by the amounts of refined products produced by refineries located in such areas and by the availability of refined products and the cost of transportation to such areas from refineries located outside those areas. 
 In addition, we face competition from trucks that deliver product in a number of areas we serve. Although their costs may not be competitive for longer hauls or large volume shipments, trucks compete effectively for incremental and marginal volumes in many areas we serve. The availability of truck transportation places some competitive constraints on us. 
 - 20 - 

Our refined product terminals compete with other independent terminal operators as well as integrated oil companies based on terminal location, price, versatility and services provided. Our competition primarily comes from integrated petroleum companies, refining and marketing companies, independent terminal companies and distribution companies with marketing and trading arms. Historically, the significant majority of the throughput at our terminal facilities has come from HF Sinclair. 
 GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION 
 Safety and Maintenance 
 Many of our pipelines are subject to regulation by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration PHMSA of the Department of Transportation. PHMSA has promulgated regulations governing, among other things, maximum operating pressures, pipeline patrols and leak surveys, control room management, and emergency procedures, as well as other matters intended to prevent accidents and failures. Additionally, PHMSA has promulgated regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs for certain pipelines that, in the event of a pipeline leak or rupture, could affect high consequence areas, which are areas where a release could have the most significant adverse consequences, including high-population areas, certain drinking water sources and unusually sensitive ecological areas. 
 In addition, many states have adopted regulations, similar to, or which go above and beyond, existing PHMSA regulations, for certain intrastate pipelines. For example, Texas has developed regulatory programs that largely parallel the federal regulatory scheme and impose additional requirements for certain pipelines. Furthermore, other related programs, such as the EPA s Risk Management Program and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration s Process Safety Management standard apply to some of our terminals and associated facilities. 
 We perform preventive and normal maintenance on all of our pipeline and terminal systems and make repairs and replacements when necessary or appropriate. We also conduct routine and required inspections of our pipelines and other assets as required by regulations. Corrosion inhibitors, external coatings and impressed current cathodic protection systems are used to protect against internal and external corrosion. We regularly monitor, test and record the effectiveness of these corrosion-control systems. We monitor the structural integrity of covered segments of our pipeline systems through a program of periodic internal inspections using electronic smart pigs , hydrostatic testing, and other measures. We follow these inspections with a review of the data, and we make repairs as necessary to maintain the integrity of the pipeline. We have initiated a risk-based approach to prioritizing the pipeline segments for future smart pig runs or other appropriate integrity testing methods. This approach is intended to allow the pipelines that have the greatest risk potential to receive the highest priority in being scheduled for inspections or pressure tests for integrity. Nonetheless, the adoption of new or amended regulations or the reinterpretation of existing laws and regulations by PHMSA or states that result in more stringent or costly pipeline integrity management or safety standards could possibly have a substantial effect on us and similarly situated midstream operators. 
 Maintenance facilities containing equipment for pipe repairs, spare parts, and trained response personnel are located along the pipelines. Employees participate in simulated spill response exercises on a regular basis. They also participate in actual spill response boom deployment exercises in planned spill scenarios in accordance with Oil Pollution Act of 1990 requirements. 
 At our terminals, tanks designed for gasoline storage are equipped with internal or external floating roofs that minimize emissions and prevent potentially flammable vapor accumulation between fluid levels and the roof of the tank. Our terminal facilities have facility response plans, spill prevention and control plans, and other plans and programs to respond to emergencies. 
 Many of our terminal loading racks are protected with water deluge systems activated by either heat sensors or an emergency switch. Several of our terminals are also protected by foam systems that are activated in case of fire. All of our terminals participate in a comprehensive environmental management program to assure compliance with applicable air, solid waste and wastewater regulations. 
 For further information on pipeline safety and regulatory requirements related to maintenance, see our risk factor Our operations are subject to evolving federal, state and local laws, regulations and permit/authorization requirements regarding our business, capital projects, environmental protection, health, operational safety and product quality. Potential liabilities arising from these laws, regulations and requirements could affect our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business. under Item 1A Risk Factors.

FERC Regulation - Liquids Pipelines 
 Some of our existing refined products and crude oil pipelines provide interstate transportation services subject to regulation by the FERC pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act (the ICA ). The ICA requires that the rates charged by these pipelines (referred to as interstate liquids pipelines must be just and reasonable. The ICA also prohibits interstate liquids pipelines from providing services in a manner that unduly discriminates against or confers undue preference upon any shipper. The ICA permits interested persons to challenge newly proposed or changed rates or rules and authorizes the FERC to suspend the effectiveness of such proposed rates or rules for a period of up to seven months, during which the FERC may investigate whether the proposed rate or rules are just and reasonable. Upon completion of an investigation, the FERC may require the interstate liquids pipeline carrier to refund the revenues collected during the pendency of the investigation that are in excess of the amount the FERC determines to be just and reasonable, together with interest. The FERC also may investigate, upon complaint or on its own motion, rates that are already in effect and may order an interstate liquids pipeline to change its rates prospectively. Upon an appropriate showing, a shipper may obtain reparations (including interest) for damages sustained during the two years prior to the filing of a complaint. 
 
 As a general matter, interstate liquids pipelines may change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index that FERC reviews every five years. Cost-of-service ratemaking, market-based rates, and settlement rates are alternatives to the indexing approach and may be used in certain specified circumstances to change rates. When an interstate liquids pipeline adjusts its rates using the index methodology, shippers may challenge rate increases made within the ceiling levels. The FERC s regulations provide that a protest against an index rate increase must allege reasonable grounds that the index rate increase is so substantially in excess of the actual cost increases incurred by the carrier that the rate is unjust and unreasonable. 
 
 On December 17, 2020, FERC established a new price index for the five-year period commencing July 1, 2021 and ending June 30, 2026, in which common carriers charging indexed rates were permitted to adjust their indexed ceilings annually by Producer Price Index plus 0.78 . FERC received requests for rehearing of its December 17, 2020 order, and on January 20, 2022, FERC revised the index level used to determine the annual changes to interstate oil pipeline rate ceilings to Producer Price Index minus 0.21 . The order required recalculation of the July 1, 2021 index ceilings to be effective as of March 1, 2022. 
 
 State Regulation - Liquids Pipelines 
 
 While the FERC regulates the rates for interstate shipments on our interstate liquids pipelines, the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission regulates the rates for intrastate shipments on our pipelines in New Mexico, the Texas Railroad Commission regulates the rates for intrastate shipments on our pipelines in Texas and the Oklahoma Corporation Commission regulates the rates for intrastate shipments on our pipelines in Oklahoma. Generally, these state agencies have not investigated the rates or practices of intrastate pipelines subject to their jurisdiction in the absence of shipper complaints. 
 
 Environmental Regulation and Remediation 
 
 Our operation of pipelines, terminals, and associated facilities in connection with the transportation and storage of refined products and crude oil is subject to stringent and complex federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the potential discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of human health and the environment and natural resources, including climate change. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain permits for our operations or result in the imposition of strict requirements relating to air emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels, biodiversity, wastewater discharges, waste management, process safety and risk management, spill planning and prevention and the remediation of spills, leaks and other contamination. As with the industry generally, compliance with existing, changing, and new laws, regulations, interpretations and guidance increases our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to construct, maintain, upgrade and operate equipment and facilities. These laws and regulations affect our operations, maintenance, capital expenditures and net income, as well as those of our competitors. These existing and any new laws and regulations, and the interpretation or enforcement thereof, are subject to frequent change by regulatory authorities, and we are unable to predict the ongoing cost to us of complying with these laws and regulations or the future impact of these laws and regulations on our operations. Violation of environmental laws, regulations, and permits can result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, and injunctions, construction bans or delays; delays in the permitting, development or expansion of projects; limitations or prohibitions on certain operations; and reputational harm. In addition, many environmental laws contain citizen suit provisions, allowing environmental groups to bring suits to enforce compliance with environmental laws. Environmental groups frequently challenge pipeline infrastructure projects. Moreover, a major discharge of hydrocarbons or hazardous substances into the environment could, to the extent the event is not insured or is not fully insured, subject us to substantial expense, including the cost of remediation and restoration of any damaged natural resources, the cost to comply with applicable laws and regulations, and claims made by employees, neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage. 
 
 Contamination resulting from spills of refined products and crude oil is not unusual within the petroleum pipeline industry. Historic spills along our existing pipelines and terminals as a result of past operations have resulted in contamination of the environment, including soils and groundwater. Some environmental laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality 
 - 22 - 

of the original act on certain classes of persons that contributed to the releases of hazardous substances or petroleum hydrocarbon substances into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, the hazardous substances found at the site. Such persons may be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. Site conditions, including soils and groundwater, are being evaluated at a few of our properties where operations may have resulted in releases of hydrocarbons and other wastes. 
 
 There are environmental remediation projects in progress, including assessment and monitoring activities, that relate to certain assets acquired from HF Sinclair. Under the Omnibus Agreement and certain transportation agreements and purchase agreements with HF Sinclair, HF Sinclair has agreed to indemnify us, subject to certain monetary and time limitations, for environmental noncompliance and remediation liabilities associated with certain assets transferred to us from HF Sinclair and occurring or existing prior to the date of such transfers. 
 
 We have an environmental agreement with Delek with respect to pre-closing environmental costs and liabilities relating to the pipelines and terminals acquired from Delek in 2005, under which Delek will indemnify us subject to certain monetary and time limitations. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, we have an accr ual of 19.5 million that relates to environmental clean-up projects for which we have assumed liability, including accrued environmental liabilities assumed in the Sinclair Transportation acquisition that have preliminarily been fair valued at 14.7 million as of the acquisition date, or for which the indemnity provided f or by HF Sinclair has expired. There are environmental remediation projects in progress, including assessment and monitoring activities, that relate to certain assets acquired from HF Sinclair. Certain of these projects were underway prior to our purchase, are covered under the HF Sinclair environmental indemnification discussed above, and represent liabilities retained by HF Sinclair. 
 
 On July 8, 2022, the Osage pipeline, which carries crude oil from Cushing, Oklahoma to El Dorado, Kansas, suffered a release of crude oil. Our equity in earnings (loss) of equity method investments was reduced in the year ended December 31, 2022 by 17.6 million for our 50 share of incurred and estimated environmental remediation and recovery expenses associated with the release, net of our share of insurance proceeds received to date of 3.0 million. We expect Osage will receive additional insurance recoveries, which will be recorded as they are received. If our insurance policy pays out in full, our share of the remaining insurance coverage is expected to be 9.5 million. The pipeline resumed operations in the third quarter of 2022 and remediation efforts are underway. 
 
 We may experience future releases into the environment from our pipelines and terminals or discover historical releases that were previously unidentified or not assessed. Although we maintain an extensive inspection and audit program designed, as applicable, to prevent, detect and address these releases promptly, damages and liabilities incurred due to any future environmental releases from our assets have the potential to substantially affect our business. 
 CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS 
 Our pipeline and terminalling operations are capital intensive, requiring investments to maintain, expand, upgrade or enhance existing operations and to meet environmental and operational regulations. Our capital requirements have consisted of, and are expected to continue to consist of, maintenance capital expenditures and expansion capital expenditures. Maintenance capital expenditures represent capital expenditures to replace partially or fully depreciated assets to maintain the operating capacity of existing assets. Maintenance capital expenditures include expenditures required to maintain equipment reliability, tankage and pipeline integrity, safety and to address environmental regulations. Expansion capital expenditures represent capital expenditures to expand the operating capacity of existing or new assets, whether through construction or acquisition. Expansion capital expenditures include expenditures to acquire assets, to grow our business and to expand existing facilities, such as projects that increase throughput capacity on our pipelines and in our terminals. Repair and maintenance expenses associated with existing assets that are minor in nature and do not extend the useful life of existing assets are charged to operating expenses as incurred. 
 
 Each year the board of directors of HLS, our ultimate general partner, approves our annual capital budget, which specifies capital projects that our management is authorized to undertake. Additionally, at times when conditions warrant or as new opportunities arise, additional projects may be approved. The funds allocated for a particular capital project may be expended over a period in excess of a year, depending on the time required to complete the project. Therefore, our planned capital expenditures for a given year consist of expenditures approved for capital projects included in the current year's capital budget as well as, in certain cases, expenditures approved for capital projects in capital budgets for prior years. Our current 2023 capital forecast is comprised of approximately 25 million to 35 million for maintenance capital expenditures and 5 to 10 million for expansion capital expenditures and joint venture investments. In addition to our capital budget, we may spend funds periodically to perform capital upgrades or additions to our assets where a customer reimburses us for such costs. The upgrades or additions would generally benefit the customer over the remaining life of the related service agreements. 
 - 23 - 

We expect that our currently planned sustaining and maintenance capital expenditures, as well as expenditures for capital development projects, will be funded with cash generated by operations. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets. 
 Under the terms of the transaction to acquire HFC's 75 interest in UNEV, we issued to a subsidiary of HFC (now HF Sinclair) a Class B unit comprising a noncontrolling equity interest in a wholly owned subsidiary subject to redemption to the extent that HFC is entitled to a 50 interest in 75 of annual UNEV earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization above 40 million beginning July 1, 2015, and ending in June 2032, subject to certain limitations. However, to the extent earnings thresholds are not achieved, no redemption payments are required. No redemption payments have been required to date. 
 HUMAN CAPITAL 
 Our People 
 We are managed by HLS, our ultimate general partner. HLS is a subsidiary of HF Sinclair. The employees providing services to us are either provided by HLS, which utilizes people employed by HF Sinclair to perform services for us, or seconded to us by subsidiaries of HF Sinclair, as neither we nor our ultimate general partner have any employees. Under the Secondment Agreement with HF Sinclair, certain employees of HF Sinclair are seconded to HLS, our ultimate general partner, to provide operational and maintenance services for certain of our processing, refining, pipeline and tankage assets, and HLS reimburses HF Sinclair for its prorated portion of the wages, benefits, and other costs of these employees for our benefit. In addition, as more fully described under Part III, Item 11. Executive Compensation, certain executive officers of HLS are also executive officers of HF Sinclair and devote as much of their professional time as necessary to oversee the management our business and affairs. 
 The One HF Sinclair Culture focuses on five key values safety, integrity, teamwork, ownership and inclusion. These values influence decisions, shape behaviors and provide the opportunity for employees to thrive. Safety is our first priority. We care about our people and have implemented policies and procedures designed to help them return home safely every day. We focus on integrity and doing the right thing. We champion a culture of teamwork and ownership by supporting each other and empowering employees to take action where they see a need or opportunity. Inclusion reflects our desire to foster a work environment in which employees feel valued and included in decisions, opportunities and challenges. 
 As of December 31, 2022, 405 HF Sinclair employees were dedicated to our business in addition to HF Sinclair employees seconded to HLS for a portion of their time to provide services to our business as described above. From time to time, a portion of HF Sinclair s employees that are seconded to us, are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The current collective bargaining agreements have various expiration dates between 2023 and 2026. We have experienced no material interruptions of operations due to disputes with those employees and management believes that positive working relationships exist between HF Sinclair and local unions and their members. 
 Oversight 
 As a result of our secondment arrangements with HF Sinclair, strategic oversight for human capital management is shared between the HLS Board of Directors and board committees and the HF Sinclair Board of Directors and board committees. As further discussed under Part III, Item 11. Executive Compensation, the HLS Compensation Committee determines cash and bonus compensation for HLS s Chief Executive Officer, President or Chief Financial Officer if such officers are solely dedicated to HLS. The HF Sinclair Board of Directors and Board committees provide oversight on strategies and policies related to the human capital management of HF Sinclair employees seconded to, and shared with, HLS. The HF Sinclair Compensation Committee is responsible for periodically reviewing HF Sinclair s strategies and policies regarding the promotion of employee diversity, equity and inclusion, talent and performance management, pay equity and employee engagement, as well as executive succession planning. The HLS Board of Directors and HF Sinclair s Nominating, Governance and Social Responsibility Committee oversee policies and practices regarding human rights in their respective operations and supply chain. This process is designed to provide high level oversight of our strategies related to attracting, retaining and developing a workforce that aligns with our values and strategies. 
 Diversity Inclusion 
 HLS and HF Sinclair leadership is committed to attracting, retaining and developing a highly engaged, high-performing, diverse workforce and cultivating an inclusive workplace where all employees feel valued and have a sense of belonging. Of HF Sinclair's total employees as of December 31, 2022, approximately 17 identified as female and approximately 83 identified as male. Approximately 22 of HF Sinclair's total employees identified as Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American, Asian, American Indian or Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, or as two or more races. We are also committed to hiring and retaining veterans and reservists of the U.S. armed forces, who represented approximately 5 of HF Sinclair's U.S. workforce as of December 31, 2022. 
 - 24 - 

Increasing diversity and inclusion efforts is an organizational priority for HLS and HF Sinclair. HF Sinclair has introduced diversity awareness programs focused on increasing the number of underrepresented persons in engineering roles. HF Sinclair s university recruiting team has partnered with historically black colleges and universities to offer full-time and summer internship opportunities and various diversity and inclusion organizations at universities to sponsor and participate in events, such as the North Texas Women s Energy Network and the National Society of Black Engineers Convention. In addition, to help foster a culture of inclusion, HF Sinclair has two employee resource groups, one focused on developing talent at HF Sinclair by fostering relationships through education, networking and leadership development opportunities and the other focused on veterans. In 2021, HF Sinclair formed an Inclusion and Diversity Working Group to develop and further implement HF Sinclair s inclusion and diversity initiatives, to gather and report best practices related to inclusion and diversity, and to assist in developing ongoing inclusion and diversity goals and objectives. 
 Health Safety 
 The safety of our employees, contractors and communities is an overarching priority and fundamental to our operational success. We have a comprehensive Pipeline Excellence Program that builds upon best practices and processes and is designed to advance organizational safety and performance, drive reliability and deliver strong results. Our approach allows for flexibility in unique operations and environments and provides a model for continuous improvement and fosters a strong culture of safety within our company. Pipelines are a vital component of our nation s infrastructure, making it imperative that we safeguard our pipelines against any type of damage. We have implemented rigorous awareness and damage prevention programs that aim to educate the public and other key stakeholders and continually invest in the maintenance and integrity of our assets, including inspection and repair programs to comply with federal and state regulations. 
 Total Rewards Development 
 We believe that the health of our company is linked to the performance and health of our people. The HF Sinclair employees that provide service to us are eligible to participate in the same comprehensive and competitive total rewards programs that are provided to employees of HF Sinclair generally. HF Sinclair s benefit offerings are designed to support employee health, financial and emotional needs, inclusive of comprehensive coverage for health care, a competitive retirement savings benefit, vacation and holiday time and other income protection and work life benefits. HF Sinclair also provides tools to help recognize and reward employee performance consistent with the One HF Sinclair Culture. 
 Consistent with the HF Sinclair culture values of ownership and growth, HF Sinclair offers training, development and engagement programs to its employees that provide services to us which provide employees the opportunity to develop their career by enhancing skills and capabilities consistent with the needs of the business. Our suite of programs include: Accelerate, a curated collection of on-demand e-learning for all employees; Refine, interactive, instructor-led workshops focusing on professional development at any career level; Front Line Leadership Development, a series of leadership training for new and existing supervisors; Catalyst, a guided cohort of new leaders learning about leadership styles and executive presence; and Leading the HF Sinclair Way, a deep-dive for our senior leaders on leading through our cultural values and business objectives.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Risk Factor Summary 
 
 Investing in us involves a degree of risk. You should carefully consider all information in this Form 10-K, including the Management s Discussion Analysis section and the financial statements and related notes, prior to investing in our common units. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 
 Risks Related to our Business/Industry: 
 We depend on HF Sinclair for a substantial portion of our revenues. A significant reduction in those revenues or a material deterioration of HF Sinclair's financial condition could reduce our revenues materially. 
 General economic conditions or, due to our lack of asset and geographic diversification, an adverse development in our businesses could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 Any reduction in the capacity of, or the allocations to, our shippers on interconnecting, third-party pipelines could cause a reduction of volumes transported in our pipelines and through our terminals. 
 A material decrease in the supply, or a material increase in the price, of crude oil or other materials available to HF Sinclair's refineries and our pipelines and terminals, and a corresponding decrease in demand for refined products in the markets served by our pipelines and terminals, could reduce our revenues materially. 
 Competition from other pipelines that may be able to supply our shippers' customers with refined products at a lower price could cause us to reduce our rates or could reduce our revenues. 
 Our operations are subject to catastrophic losses, operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be adequately insured. 
 If we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs or in a timely manner, incur increased maintenance or repair costs on assets, or if assumed market conditions deteriorate, our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic, and actions taken in response thereto, has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 We may be unsuccessful in integrating the operations of acquired assets or businesses, including the Sinclair business acquired in the HEP Transaction, and in realizing the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions. 
 We may not be able to fully execute our growth strategy if we encounter illiquid capital markets or increased competition for investment opportunities, if our assumptions concerning population growth are inaccurate, or if an agreement cannot be reached with HF Sinclair for the acquisition of assets on which we have a right of first offer. 
 We do not own all of the land on which our pipeline systems and other assets are located, which could result in disruptions to our operations. Regulatory changes related to a state s use of eminent domain could inhibit our ability to secure rights-of-way for future pipeline construction projects. 
 Our business may suffer due to a change in the composition of our Board of Directors, the departure of any of our key senior executives or other key employees who provide services to us. 
 Terrorist attacks, and the threat of terrorist attacks or vandalism, have resulted in increased costs to our business. Global hostilities may adversely impact our results of operations. 
 We could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of products we distribute to meet certain quality specifications. 
 We may not be able to retain existing customers or acquire new customers. 
 We own certain of our systems through joint ventures, and our control of such systems is limited by provisions of the agreements we have entered into with our joint venture partners and by our percentage ownership in such enterprises. 
 
 Risks Related to Government Regulation 
 Our operations are subject to evolving federal, state and local laws, regulations, oversight by governmental agencies and permit/authorization requirements regarding our business, capital projects and environmental protection (including greenhouse gases and climate change protection), health, operational safety and product quality, any of which could result in potential liabilities, increased operating costs, and reduced demand for our services. 
 
 - 26 - 

Increasing attention to environmental, social and governance ESG matters may adversely impact our business, financial results, stock price or price of debt securities. 
 
 Risks Related to Cybersecurity, Data Security and Privacy, Information Technology and Intellectual Property 
 Cyberattacks, data security breaches, information technology system failures, network disruptions, vandalism, terrorist attacks or global hostilities or other sustained military campaigns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Our business is subject to complex and evolving laws, security standards, and regulations and policies regarding data privacy, cybersecurity and data protection, and may be subject to additional related laws and regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate or expand. Such laws, standards and regulations could result in claims, increased cost of operations, or otherwise harm our ability to compete in the market. 
 Risks Related to Liquidity, Financial Instruments and Credit 
 Increases in interest rates could adversely affect our business. Our leverage or volatile credit/capital markets may limit our ability to borrow funds on acceptable terms, service our indebtedness or capitalize on business opportunities. 
 If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, our ability to pay quarterly distributions to our common unitholders at current levels or to increase our quarterly distributions in the future could be impaired materially. 
 We are exposed to the credit risks and certain other risks, of our or our joint ventures' key customers, vendors, and other counterparties. Adverse changes in our and/or our general partner's credit ratings and risk profile may negatively affect us. 
 Risks to Common Unitholders 
 HF Sinclair and its affiliates may have conflicts of interest and limited fiduciary duties, which may permit them to favor their own interests or engage in limited competition with us. 
 Cost reimbursements and fees due to our general partner and its affiliates for services provided are substantial. Our general partner may reduce the amount of cash in reserve available for distribution to unitholders. Even if unitholders are dissatisfied, they cannot remove our general partner without its consent. The control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent. 
 We may issue additional limited partner units without unitholder approval, which would dilute an existing unitholder's ownership interests. Our general partner has a limited call right that may require a unitholder to sell its common units at an undesirable time or price. 
 Tax Risks to Common Unitholders 
 Our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and not being subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation. Our cash available for distribution to unitholders may be substantially reduced if we become subject to entity-level taxation as a result of the Internal Revenue Service IRS treating us as a corporation or legislative, judicial or administrative changes, and it may also be reduced by any audit adjustments if imposed directly on the partnership. 
 Even if unitholders do not receive cash distributions from us, unitholders will be required to pay taxes on their share of our taxable income. Unitholders may be subject to limitation on their ability to deduct interest expense incurred by us. 
 Tax-exempt entities and non-U.S. unitholders face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them. The IRS may challenge certain tax positions, treatment methodologies or allocations, which could adversely affect the value of our common units. 
 
 Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations. If any of the following risks were to actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or treatment of unitholders could be materially and adversely affected. The headings provided in this Item 1A. are for convenience and reference purposes only and shall not affect or limit the extent or interpretation of the risk factors. 
 - 27 - 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS/INDUSTRY 
 
 We depend on HF Sinclair (particularly its Navajo and Woods Cross refineries) for a substantial portion of our revenues; if those revenues were significantly reduced or if HF Sinclair's financial condition materially deteriorated, there would be a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, HF Sinclair accoun ted f or 70 of the revenues of our petroleum product and crude pipelines, 85 of the revenues of our terminals, tankage, and truck loading racks, and 100 of the revenue from our refinery processing units. We expect to continue to derive a majority of our revenues from HF Sinclair for the foreseeable future. If HF Sinclair satisfies only its minimum obligations under the long-term pipeline and terminal, tankage and throughput agreements that it has with us or is unable to meet its minimum annual payment commitment for any reason, including due to prolonged downtime or a shutdown at its refineries, our revenues and cash flow would decline. 
 
 Any significant reduction in production at HF Sinclair s Navajo or Woods Cross refineries could reduce throughput in our pipelines, terminals and refinery processing units, resulting in materially lower levels of revenues and cash flow for the duration of the shutdown. For the year ended December 31, 2022, production from HF Sinclair's Navajo and Woods Cross refineries accounted for approximately 50 of the throughput volumes transported by our refined product, intermediate and crude pipelines. Our Woods Cross refinery processing units also accounted for 70 of our refinery processing units revenues. 
 
 Operations at any of HF Sinclair's refineries could be partially or completely shut down, temporarily or permanently, as the result of: 
 
 competition from other refineries and pipelines that may be able to supply the refinery's end-user markets on a more cost-effective basis; 
 operational problems such as catastrophic events at the refinery, terrorist or cyberattacks, vandalism, labor difficulties, or weather, including as a result of climate change, public health crisis such as COVID-19, or government response thereto, environmental proceedings or other litigation that cause a stoppage of all or a portion of the operations at the refinery; 
 planned maintenance or capital projects; 
 increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's gasoline and diesel sulfur control requirements that limit the concentration of sulfur in motor gasoline and diesel fuel for both on-road and non-road usage as well as various state and federal emission requirements that may affect the refinery itself and potential future climate change regulations; 
 an inability to obtain crude oil for the refinery at competitive prices; or 
 a general reduction in demand for refined products in the area due to: 
 a local or national recession, public health crisis such as COVID-19, or other adverse event or economic condition that results in lower spending by businesses and consumers on gasoline and diesel fuel; 
 higher gasoline prices due to higher crude oil costs, higher taxes or stricter environmental laws or regulations; or 
 a shift by consumers to more fuel-efficient or alternative fuel vehicles or an increase in fuel efficiency, whether as a result of technological advances by manufacturers, legislation either mandating or encouraging higher fuel efficiency or the increased use of alternative fuel sources or otherwise. 
 For example, on June 1, 2020, HF Sinclair announced plans to permanently cease petroleum refining operations at its Cheyenne Refinery and to convert certain assets at that refinery to renewable diesel production. HF Sinclair subsequently began winding down petroleum refining operations at the Cheyenne Refinery on August 3, 2020. 
 The effect on us of any shutdown would depend on the length of the shutdown and the extent of the refinery operations affected by the shutdown. We have no control over the factors that may lead to a shutdown or the measures HF Sinclair may take in response to a shutdown. HF Sinclair makes all decisions at each of its refineries concerning levels of production, regulatory compliance, refinery turnarounds (planned shutdowns of individual process units within the refinery to perform major maintenance activities), labor relations, environmental remediation, emission control and capital expenditures and is responsible for all related costs. HF Sinclair is not under contractual obligation to us to maintain operations at its refineries. 
 
 Furthermore, HF Sinclair's obligations under the long-term pipeline and terminal, tankage, tolling and throughput agreements with us would be temporarily suspended during the occurrence of a force majeure event that renders performance impossible with respect to an asset for at least 30 days. If such an event were to continue for a year, we or HF Sinclair could terminate the agreements. The occurrence of any of these events could reduce our revenues and cash flows.

General economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 
 Economic slowdowns may have serious negative consequences for our business and operating results, because our performance is subject to domestic economic conditions and their impact on demand for crude oil and refined products. Some of these factors include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, inflation, reductions in net worth based on declines in equity markets and residential real estate values, adverse developments in mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices, gasoline and diesel fuel prices, interest rates, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors. The demand for crude oil and refined and finished lubricant products can be reduced due to a local or national recession or other adverse economic condition, such as periods of increased or prolonged inflation, which results in lower spending by businesses and consumers on gasoline and diesel fuel, higher gasoline prices due to higher crude oil prices, a shift by consumers to more fuel-efficient vehicles or alternative fuel vehicles (such as ethanol or wider adoption of electric, gas/electric hybrid or hydrogen powered vehicles), or an increase in vehicle fuel economy, whether as a result of technological advances by manufacturers, legislation mandating or encouraging higher fuel economy or the use of alternative fuel. 
 
 Political instability, actual or potential hostilities or other conflicts in oil producing areas, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, and global health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can also impact the global economy and decrease worldwide demand for oil and refined products, which affects the prices of crude oil. Increased volatility in the global oil markets, including the prices our customers and suppliers pay for crude oil and other raw materials, has, and may continue to, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows as well as our ability to pay distributions to our common unitholders. 
 
 Adverse developments in the global economy or in regional economies could also negatively impact our customers and suppliers, and therefore have a negative impact on our business or financial condition. In the event of adverse developments or stagnation in the economy or financial markets, our customers and suppliers may experience deterioration of their businesses, reduced demand for their products, cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing. As a result, existing or potential customers might delay or cancel plans to use our services and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion. Further, suppliers may experience similar conditions, which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. Moreover, a financial market crisis may have a material adverse impact on financial institutions and limit access to capital and credit. This could, among other things, make it more difficult for us to obtain or increase our cost of obtaining) capital and financing for our operations. Our access to additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. 
 
 Due to our lack of asset and geographic diversification, an adverse development in our businesses could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 A significant concentration of our pipeline assets serve HF Sinclair's Navajo refinery. Due to our limited asset and geographic diversification, an adverse development in our business (including adverse developments as a result of catastrophic events or weather, including as a result of climate change, terrorist or cyberattacks, vandalism, public health crisis, decreased supply of crude oil and feedstocks and/or decreased demand for refined petroleum products), could have a significantly greater impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows than if we maintained more diverse assets in more diverse locations. 
 
 Any reduction in the capacity of, or the allocations to, our shippers on interconnecting, third-party pipelines could cause a reduction of volumes transported in our pipelines and through our terminals. 
 
 HF Sinclair and the other users of our pipelines and terminals are dependent upon connections to third-party pipelines to receive and deliver crude oil and refined products. Any reduction of capacities of these interconnecting pipelines due to testing, line repair, reduced operating pressures, catastrophic events, terror or cyberattacks, vandalism or other causes could result in reduced volumes transported in our pipelines or through our terminals. Similarly, if additional shippers begin transporting volumes of refined products over interconnecting pipelines, the allocations to existing shippers in these pipelines would be reduced, which could also reduce volumes transported in our pipelines or through our terminals. 
 
 A material decrease in the supply, or a material increase in the price, of crude oil or other materials available to HF Sinclair's refineries and our pipelines and terminals, and a corresponding decrease in demand for refined products in the markets served by our pipelines and terminals, could reduce our revenues materially. 
 
 The volume of refined products we transport in our refined product pipelines depends on the level of production of refined products from HF Sinclair's refineries, which, in turn, depends on the availability of attractively-priced crude oil produced in the areas accessible to those refineries. In order to maintain or increase production levels at their refineries, our shippers must continually contract for new crude oil supplies. A material decrease in crude oil production from the fields that supply their refineries, as a result of depressed commodity prices, decreased demand, lack of drilling activity, natural production declines, governmental regulations, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns, catastrophic events or otherwise, could result in a decline in the volume of crude oil our shippers refine, absent the availability of transported crude oil to offset such declines. Such an event would result in an overall decline in volumes of refined products transported through our pipelines and therefore a corresponding reduction in our cash flow. In addition, the future growth of our 
 - 29 - 

shippers' operations will depend in part upon whether our shippers can contract for additional supplies of crude oil at a greater rate than the rate of natural decline in their currently connected supplies. 
 
 Fluctuations in crude oil prices can greatly affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new oil reserves. Drilling activity generally decreases as crude oil prices decrease. We and our shippers have no control over producers or their production decisions, which are affected by, among other things, prevailing and projected energy prices, demand for hydrocarbons, geological considerations, governmental regulation, global market conditions, actions by foreign nations and the availability and cost of capital, or over the level of drilling activity in the areas of operations, the amount of reserves underlying the wells and the rate at which production from a well will decline. Similarly, a material increase in the price of crude oil supplied to refineries without an increase in the market value of the products produced by the refineries, either temporary or permanent, which causes a reduction in the production of refined products at the refineries, would cause a reduction in the volumes of refined products we transport, and our cash flow could be adversely affected. 
 
 In addition, periods of disruption in the global supply chain, including as a result of COVID-19, have caused shortages in the equipment and parts necessary to operate our facilities and to complete our capital projects. Certain suppliers have experienced, and may continue to experience, delays related to a variety of factors, including logistical delays and component shortages from vendors. We continue to monitor the situation and work closely with our suppliers to minimize disruption to our operations as a result of supply chain interruptions. 
 
 Finally, our business depends in large part on the demand for the various petroleum products we gather, transport and store in the markets we serve. Reductions in that demand adversely affect our business. Market demand varies based upon the different end uses of the petroleum products we gather, transport and store. We cannot predict the impact of future fuel conservation measures, alternate fuel requirements, government regulation, global pandemic, technological advances in fuel economy and energy-generation devices, exploration and production activities, actions by foreign nations, and any potential litigation related to climate change effects and resulting negative public perception, any of which could reduce the demand for the petroleum products in the areas we serve. The volatility in global oil markets, while uncertain, has, and may continue to, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows, as well as our ability to pay distributions to our common unitholders. 
 
 Competition from other pipelines that may be able to supply our shippers' customers with refined products at a lower price could cause us to reduce our rates or could reduce our revenues. 
 
 We and our shippers could face increased competition if other pipelines are able to supply our shippers' end-user markets competitively with refined products. For example, increased supplies of refined product delivered by Kinder Morgan's El Paso to Phoenix pipeline could result in additional downward pressure on wholesale-refined product prices and refined product margins in El Paso and related markets. Additionally, further increases in products from Gulf Coast refiners entering the El Paso and Arizona markets on this and other pipelines and a resulting increase in the demand for shipping product on the interconnecting common carrier pipelines could cause a decline in the demand for refined product from HF Sinclair. This could reduce our opportunity to earn revenues from HF Sinclair in excess of its minimum volume commitment obligations. 
 
 An additional factor that could affect some of HF Sinclair's markets is excess pipeline capacity from the West Coast into our shippers' Arizona markets. Additional increases in shipments of refined products from the West Coast into our shippers' Arizona markets could result in additional downward pressure on refined product prices that, if sustained over the long term, could influence product shipments by HF Sinclair to these markets. 
 
 Our operations are subject to catastrophic losses, operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be adequately insured. 
 
 Our operations are subject to catastrophic losses, operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions such as natural disasters, adverse weather, earthquakes, accidents, fires, explosions, hazardous materials releases or spills (such as the release of crude oil on the Osage pipeline in July 2022), terror or cyberattacks, vandalism, power failures, mechanical failures and other events beyond our control, and we have experienced certain of these events in the past. These events could result in an injury or loss of life; and have in the past and could in the future result in property damage or destruction or curtailment or interruption in our operations. In addition, third-party damage, mechanical malfunctions, undetected leaks in pipelines, faulty measurement or other errors may result in significant costs or lost revenues. 
 
 We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at commercially reasonable rates and exclusions from coverage may limit our ability to recover the amount of the full loss in all situations. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies and insurance policies for our joint ventures are increasing. In some instances, certain insurance has become unavailable or has become available only for reduced amounts of coverage or at a significantly increased cost. 
 
 - 30 - 

There can be no assurance that insurance will cover all or any damages and losses resulting from these types of hazards. We are not fully insured against all risks or incidents to our business and therefore, we self-insure certain risks. We are not insured against all environmental accidents that might occur. Our property insurance includes business interruption coverage for lost profit arising from physical damage to our facilities. If a significant accident or event occurs that is self-insured or not fully insured, our operations could be temporarily or permanently impaired, our liabilities and expenses could be significant and it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. Because our partnership agreement requires us to distribute all available cash (less operating surplus cash reserves) to our unitholders, we do not have the same flexibility as other legal entities to accumulate cash to protect against under insured or uninsured losses. 
 
 If we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs or in a timely manner, if we incur increased maintenance or repair costs on assets, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 Delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving construction of new facilities (or improvements and increased maintenance or repair expenditures on our existing facilities) could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted operating results. Although we evaluate and monitor each capital spending project and try to anticipate difficulties that may arise, such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of numerous factors, such as: 
 
 third-party challenges to, denials, or delays in issuing requisite regulatory approvals and/or permits; 
 societal and political pressures and other forms of opposition; 
 compliance with or liability under environmental or pipeline safety regulations; 
 unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor; 
 disruptions in transportation of modular components and/or construction materials; 
 severe adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, terror or cyberattacks, domestic vandalism other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors and suppliers; 
 shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages; 
 market-related increases in a project's debt or equity financing costs; and/or 
 nonperformance or force majeure by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors, or sub-contractors involved with a project. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic or any other widespread outbreak of an illness or pandemic or other public health crisis, and actions taken in response thereto, has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our operations, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 COVID-19 s spread across the globe and government regulations in response thereto have negatively affected worldwide economic and commercial activity, impacted global demand for oil, gas and refined products, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial and commodity markets. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices from time to time as needed (including limiting employee and contractor presence at our work locations, restricting travel unless approved by senior leadership, quarantining employees when necessary and reducing utilization at our refineries) and could significantly disrupt our operations and ability to perform critical functions in the future. The effects of COVID-19 or any other pandemic are difficult to predict, and the duration of any potential business disruption or the extent to which it may negatively affect our operating results or our liquidity is unknown. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business and operating results remains undetermined and depends on future developments related to the duration and severity of the spread of the virus, emerging variants, vaccine and booster effectiveness, and government measures, designed to slow and contain the spread of COVID-19, among others, and, all of which are beyond our control. These effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, while uncertain, have, and may continue to, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows, as well as our ability to pay distributions to our common unitholders. 
 
 We may be unsuccessful in integrating the operations of the assets we have acquired or may acquire with our operations, including the Sinclair business acquired in the HEP Transaction, and in realizing all or any part of the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions. 
 
 From time to time, we evaluate and acquire assets and businesses that we believe complement our existing assets and businesses, such as the HEP Transaction with Sinclair. Acquisitions such as the HEP Transaction require, and may continue to require, management to devote significant attention and resources to integrating the acquired business with our business. We may encounter difficulties integrating personnel from the acquired business while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high-quality products and services. The disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, each company's ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies may result from the integration process. Further, we may lose key employees or encounter difficulties integrating relationships with customers, vendors, and business partners. 
 
 Delays or difficulties in the integration process could adversely affect our business, financial results, financial condition and common unit price. Even if we are able to integrate our business operations successfully, there can be no assurance that this 
 - 31 - 

integration will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies that we currently expect or have communicated from this integration or that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated time frame. 
 
 Acquisitions may require substantial capital or the incurrence of substantial indebtedness. Our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly as a result of completed or future acquisitions. Acquisitions and business expansions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the assets and operations of the acquired businesses, inefficiencies and difficulties that arise because of unfamiliarity with new assets and the businesses associated with them, and new geographic areas and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. Performance at HEP or the acquired business may suffer as a result of any such diversion of management s attention. Further, unexpected costs and challenges may arise whenever businesses with different operations or management are combined, and we may experience unanticipated delays in realizing the benefits of an acquisition. Also, following an acquisition, we may discover previously unknown and unforeseen liabilities associated with the acquired business or assets for which we have no recourse under applicable indemnification provisions. 
 
 We m ay not be able to fully execute our growth strategy if we encounter illiquid capital markets or increased competition for investment opportunities, if our assumptions concerning population growth are inaccurate, or if an agreement cannot be reached with HF Sinclair for the acquisition of assets on which we have a right of first offer. 
 
 Our strategy contemplates growth through the development and acquisition of crude, intermediate and refined products transportation and storage assets while maintaining a strong balance sheet. This strategy includes constructing and acquiring additional assets and businesses, either from HF Sinclair or third parties, to enhance our ability to compete effectively and diversifying our asset portfolio, thereby providing more stable cash flow. We regularly consider and enter into discussions regarding, and are currently contemplating and/or pursuing, potential joint ventures, stand-alone projects or other transactions that we believe will present opportunities to realize synergies, expand our role in our chosen businesses and increase our market position. 
 
 We will require substantial new capital to finance the future development and acquisition of assets and businesses. Any limitations on our access to capital will impair our ability to execute this strategy. If the cost of such capital becomes too expensive, or if the development or acquisition opportunities are on terms that do not allow us to obtain appropriate financing, our ability to develop or acquire accretive assets will be limited. We may not be able to raise the necessary funds on satisfactory terms, if at all. The primary factors that influence our cost of equity include market conditions, fees we pay to underwriters and other offering costs, which include amounts we pay for legal and accounting services. The primary factors influencing our cost of borrowing include interest rates, credit spreads, credit ratings, covenants, underwriting or loan origination fees and similar charges we pay to lenders. 
 
 In addition, we experience competition for the types of assets and businesses we have historically purchased or acquired. High competition, particularly for a limited pool of assets, may result in higher, less attractive asset prices, and therefore, we may lose to more competitive bidders. Such occurrences limit our ability to execute our growth strategy, which may materially adversely affect our ability to maintain or pay higher distributions in the future. 
 
 Our growth strategy also depends upon: 
 
 the accuracy of our assumptions about growth in the markets that we currently serve or have plans to serve in the Southwestern, Northwest and Mid-Continent regions of the United States; 
 HF Sinclair's willingness and ability to capture a share of additional demand in its existing markets; and 
 HF Sinclair's willingness and ability to identify and penetrate new markets in the Southwestern, Northwest and Mid-Continent regions of the United States. 
 
 If our assumptions about increased market demand prove incorrect, HF Sinclair may not have any incentive to increase refinery capacity and production or shift additional throughput to our pipelines, which would adversely affect our growth strategy. 
 
 Our Omnibus Agreement with HF Sinclair provides us with a right of first offer on certain of HF Sinclair s existing or acquired logistics assets. The consummation and timing of any future acquisitions of these assets will depend upon, among other things, our ability to negotiate acceptable purchase agreements and commercial agreements with respect to the assets and our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms. We can offer no assurance that we will be able to successfully consummate any future acquisitions pursuant to our right of first offer. In addition, certain of the assets covered by our right of first offer may require substantial capital expenditures in order to maintain compliance with applicable regulatory requirements or otherwise make them suitable for our commercial needs. For these or a variety of other reasons, we may decide not to exercise our right of first offer if and when any assets are offered for sale, and our decision will not be subject to unitholder approval. In addition, our right of first offer may be terminated upon a change of control of HF Sinclair. 
 - 32 - 

We do not own all of the land on which our pipeline systems and other assets are located, which could result in disruptions to our operations. Additionally, a change in the regulations related to a state s use of eminent domain could inhibit our ability to secure rights-of-way for future pipeline construction projects. Finally, certain of our assets are located on or adjacent to Native American tribal lands. 
 
 We do not own all of the land on which our pipeline systems and other assets are located, and we are, therefore, subject to the risk of increased costs or more burdensome terms to maintain necessary land use. We obtain the right to construct and operate pipelines and other assets on land owned by third parties and government agencies for specified periods. If we were to lose these rights through an inability to renew leases, right-of-way contracts or similar agreements, we may be required to relocate our pipelines or other assets and our business could be adversely affected. Additionally, it may become more expensive for us to obtain new rights-of-way or leases or to renew existing rights-of-way or leases. If the cost of obtaining or renewing such agreements increases, it may adversely affect our operations and the cash flows available for distribution to unitholders. 
 
 The adoption or amendment of laws and regulations that limit or eliminate a state s ability to exercise eminent domain over private property in a state in which we operate could make it more difficult or costly for us to secure rights-of-way for future pipeline construction and other projects. 
 
 Certain of our pipelines are located on or adjacent to Native American tribal lands. Various federal agencies, along with each Native American tribe, promulgate and enforce regulations, including environmental standards, regarding operations on Native American tribal lands. In addition, each Native American tribe is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce laws and regulations (including various taxes, fees, and other requirements and conditions) and to grant approvals independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Following a decision issued in May 2017 by the federal Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, tribal ownership of even a very small fractional interest in an allotted land, that is, tribal land owned or at one time owned by an individual Native American landowner, bars condemnation of any interest in the allotment. Consequently, the inability to condemn such allotted lands under circumstances where existing pipeline rights-of-way may soon lapse or terminate serves as an additional impediment for pipeline operations. In addition, following the Supreme Court's ruling in McGirt v. Oklahoma that the Muscogee (Creek) Nation reservation in Eastern Oklahoma has not been disestablished, and therefore retains jurisdiction over criminal matters, and a subsequent ruling in July 2022 in Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta narrowing McGirt s holding to find concurrent tribal and state jurisdiction with respect to crimes committed by non-Native Americans against Native Americans on tribal lands, substantial uncertainty exists with respect to matters over which tribes may have exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction. Although the ruling in McGirt indicates that it is limited to criminal law, the ruling has significant potential implications for civil law. At this time, we cannot predict how these jurisdictional issues may ultimately be resolved. These factors may increase our cost of doing business on Native American tribal lands. 
 
 In addition, our industry is subject to potentially disruptive activities by those concerned with the possible environmental impacts of pipeline routes. Activists, non-governmental organizations and others may seek to restrict the transportation of crude oil and refined products by exerting social or political pressure to influence when, and whether, such rights-of-way or permits are granted. This interference could impact future pipeline development, which could interfere with or block expansion or development projects and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. 
 
 Our business may suffer due to a change in the composition of our Board of Directors, the departure of any of our key senior executives or other key employees who provide services to us, or if certain of our executive officers, who also allocate time to our general partner and its affiliates, do not have enough time to dedicate to our business. Furthermore, a shortage of skilled labor or disruptions in the labor force that provides services to us may make it difficult for us to maintain labor productivity. 
 
 Our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of HLS's Board of Directors, key senior executives and key senior employees who provide services to us. Also, our business depends on the continuing ability to recruit, train and retain highly qualified employees in all areas of our operations, including accounting, business operations, finance and other key back-office and mid-office personnel. The competition for these employees is intense, and the loss of these executives or employees could harm our business. If any of these executives or other key personnel resign or become unable to continue in their present roles and are not adequately replaced, our business operations could be materially adversely affected. We do not currently maintain key person life insurance for any executives. Furthermore, our operations require skilled and experienced laborers with proficiency in multiple tasks. A shortage of trained workers due to retirements or otherwise or an increase in labor costs as a result of inflation or otherwise could have an adverse impact on productivity and costs, which could adversely affect our operations. 
 
 Our general partner shares officers and administrative personnel with HF Sinclair to operate both our business and HF Sinclair's business. These officers face conflicts regarding the allocation of their and other employees' time, which may affect adversely our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
 
 - 33 - 

A portion of HF Sinclair's employees that are seconded to us from time to time are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements with various expiration dates. HF Sinclair may not be able to renegotiate the collective bargaining agreements when they expire on satisfactory terms or at all. A failure to do so may increase our costs. In addition, existing labor agreements may not prevent a future strike or work stoppage, and any work stoppage could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Terrorist attacks, and the threat of terrorist attacks or vandalism, have resulted in increased costs to our business. Global hostilities may adversely impact our results of operations. 
 
 The long-term impact of (and threat of future) terrorist attacks and vandalism, on the energy transportation industry in general, and on us in particular, is unknown. Any attack on our facilities, those of our customers and, in some cases, those of other pipelines could have a material adverse effect on our business. Increased security measures taken by us as a precaution against possible terrorist attacks or vandalism have resulted in increased costs to our business. 
 
 The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that pipelines and other assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations. These potential targets might include our pipeline systems or operating systems and may affect our ability to operate or control our pipeline assets or our operations could be disrupted. The occurrence of one of these events could cause a substantial decrease in revenues, increased costs to respond or other financial loss, damage to reputation, increased regulation or litigation and or inaccurate information reported from our operations. These developments may subject our operations to increased risks, as well as increased costs, and, depending on their ultimate magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Uncertainty surrounding global hostilities or other sustained military campaigns, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror, may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of crude oil supplies and markets for refined products or instability in the financial markets that could restrict our ability to raise capital. 
 
 In addition, changes in the insurance markets attributable to terrorist attacks, vandalism, or cyberattacks or extortion could make certain types of insurance more difficult for us to obtain. Moreover, the insurance that may be available to us may be significantly more expensive than our existing insurance coverage. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism, cyberattacks, vandalism or war could also affect our ability to raise capital, including our ability to repay or refinance debt. 
 
 We could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of products we distribute to meet certain quality specifications. In addition, we could be required to make substantial expenditures in the event of any changes in product quality specifications. 
 
 A significant portion of our operating responsibility on refined product pipelines is to manage the quality and purity of the products loaded at our loading racks. If our quality control measures fail, off-specification product could be sent out to public gasoline stations. This type of incident could result in liability claims regarding damages caused by the off-specification fuel or could impact our ability to retain existing customers or to acquire new customers, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 In addition, various federal, state and local agencies have the authority to prescribe specific product quality specifications of refined products. Changes in product quality specifications or blending requirements could reduce our throughput volume, require us to incur additional handling costs or require capital expenditures. For example, different product specifications for different markets impact the fungibility of the products in our system and could require the construction of additional storage. If we are unable to recover these costs through increased revenues, our cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in the product quality of the products we receive on our petroleum products pipeline system could reduce or eliminate our ability to blend products. 
 
 We may not be able to retain existing customers or acquire new customers. 
 
 The renewal or replacement of existing contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows depends on a number of factors outside our control, including competition from other pipelines and the demand for refined products in the markets that we serve. 
 
 We own certain of our systems through joint ventures, and our control of such systems is limited by provisions of the agreements we have entered into with our joint venture partners and by our percentage ownership in such joint ventures. 
 
 Certain of our systems are operated by joint venture entities for which we do not serve as the operator, or in which we do not have an ownership stake that permits us to control the business activities of the entity. We have limited ability to influence the business decisions of such joint venture entities. 
 - 34 - 

Because we have partial ownership in the joint ventures, we may be unable to control the amount of cash we will need for capital projects or will receive from the operation and could be required to contribute significant cash to fund our share of their projects and operations, which could adversely affect our ability to distribute cash to our unitholders. 
 
 An impairment of our long-lived assets or goodwill could reduce our earnings or negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 An impairment of our long-lived assets or goodwill could reduce our earnings or negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. We continually monitor our business, the business environment and the performance of our operations to determine if an event has occurred that indicates that a long-lived asset or goodwill may be impaired. If a triggering event occurs, which is a determination that involves judgment, we may be required to utilize cash flow projections to assess our ability to recover the carrying value based on the ability to generate future cash flows. We may also conduct impairment testing based on both the guideline public company and guideline transaction methods. Our long-lived assets and goodwill impairment analyses are sensitive to changes in key assumptions used in our analysis, estimates of future tariff rates, forecasted throughput levels, operating costs and capital expenditures. If the assumptions used in our analysis are not realized, it is possible a material impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any additional impairments of long-lived assets or goodwill in the future. 
 
 Growing our business by constructing new pipelines and terminals, or expanding existing ones, subjects us to construction risks. 
 
 One of the ways we may grow our business is through the construction of new pipelines and terminals or the expansion of existing ones. The construction of a new pipeline or the expansion of an existing pipeline, by adding horsepower or pump stations or by adding a second pipeline along an existing pipeline, involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political, and legal uncertainties, most of which are beyond our control. For example, the Biden Administration temporarily suspended the grant of certain authorizations for oil and gas activities on federal lands, although the order did not affect existing authorizations. Pipeline construction projects requiring federal approvals are generally subject to environmental review requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA"), and must also comply with other natural resource review requirements imposed pursuant to the Endangered Species Act and the National Historic Preservation Act. In April 2022, the Biden Administration revised NEPA s implementing regulations, and now requires NEPA reviews to incorporate consideration of indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project, including the effects of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. These revisions marked the end of the first phase of a two part review being undertaken by the Council on Environmental Quality (the CEQ ), and thus additional changes to the NEPA rules may be forthcoming, though we cannot predict the substance or form of such revisions. Moreover, for over 35 years, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("Corps") has authorized construction, maintenance, and repair of pipelines under a streamlined nationwide permit program under the federal Clean Water Act CWA known as Nationwide Permit 12 NWP 12 program. From time to time, environmental groups have challenged the use of NWP 12 for oil and gas pipeline projects. In April 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana determined that NWP 12 failed to comply with consultation requirements under the federal Endangered Species Act, vacated NWP 12, and enjoined the issuance of new authorizations for oil and gas pipeline projects under NWP 12, though the district court s order was subsequently limited on appeal. In January 2021, the Corps published a reissuance of NWP 12, but this permit is similarly being challenged in federal court on the same grounds that were litigated in the April 2020 case. More recently, in May 2022 the Corps announced it was beginning a formal review of NWP 12. The outcome of litigation involving the Biden Administration s Social Cost of Carbon SCC metric may also impact future regulatory decision-making with respect to our construction and development. In May 2022, the Fifth Circuit stayed a lower court s order blocking the Biden Administration s use of an interim SCC value while the government s appeal remains in progress. While the full extent and impact of these recent developments is unclear at this time, we could face significant delays and financial costs if we must obtain individual permit coverage from the Corps for our projects or satisfy more stringent environmental conditions or reviews. These projects may not be completed on schedule (or at all) or at the budgeted cost. In addition, our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. For instance, if we build a new pipeline, the construction will occur over an extended period of time and we will not receive any material increases in revenues until after completion of the project. 
 
 Moreover, we may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in demand for refined products in a region in which such growth does not materialize. As a result, new facilities may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve our expected investment return, which could adversely affect our earnings, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 RISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
 
 Our operations are subject to evolving federal, state and local laws, regulations and permit/authorization requirements regarding our business, capital projects and environmental protection, health, operational safety and product quality. Potential liabilities arising from these laws, regulations and requirements could affect our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 - 35 - 

Our pipelines and terminal, tankage and loading rack operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, and local laws, regulations and oversight regarding, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and distribution of petroleum and hazardous materials by pipeline, truck, rail, ship and barge, the emission and discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, the characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels, and other matters otherwise relating to the protection of human health and the environment and natural resources, including climate change. 
 
 Environmental laws and regulations have raised operating costs for the oil and refined products industry, and compliance with such laws and regulations may cause us, the HF Sinclair refineries, and other refineries that we support to incur potentially material expenditures associated with the construction, maintenance, and upgrading of equipment and facilities. Future environmental, health and safety requirements (or changed interpretations of existing requirements), may impose new and/or more stringent requirements on our assets and operations and require us to incur potentially material expenditures to comply. Failure to comply with any applicable laws, regulations, and requirements of regulatory authorities could subject us to substantial penalties and fines. 
 
 Our operations require numerous authorizations and permits under various laws and regulations, including environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations. These authorizations and permits are subject to revocation, renewal, modification, or third-party challenge, and can require operational changes that may involve significant costs to limit impacts or potential impacts on the environment and/or worker health and safety. For example, on January 23, 2020, the EPA, in conjunction with the Corps, issued a final rule regarding the definition of "waters of the United States," which became effective June 22, 2020 and narrowed the regulatory reach of the CWA regulations relative to a prior 2015 rulemaking. However, that rule was vacated by one court in 2021, and the Biden Administration subsequently announced a proposed rule that would generally reinstate with modifications the pre-2015 definition of waters of the United States. The proposed rule was finalized on January 18, 2023, and will become effective March 20, 2023. This new rule expands CWA jurisdiction relative to the June 2020 rule and will likely be subject to further litigation. This increase in scope could result in increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. A violation of authorization or permit conditions or other legal or regulatory requirements could result in substantial fines, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and injunctions prohibiting our operations. In addition, major modifications of our operations could require modifications to our existing permits or expensive upgrades to our existing pollution control equipment that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 We may also be required to address conditions that require environmental response actions or remediation. The transportation and storage of refined products produces a risk that refined products and other hydrocarbons may be suddenly or gradually released into the environment, potentially causing substantial expenditures for a response action, significant government penalties, liability to government agencies for natural resources damages, personal injury or property damages to private parties and significant business interruption. Further, we own or lease a number of properties that have been used to store or distribute refined products for many years. Many of these properties have also been operated by third parties whose handling, disposal, or release of hydrocarbons and other wastes were not under our control. Environmental laws can impose strict, joint and several liability for releases of oil and hazardous substances into the environment, and we could be held liable for past releases caused by third parties. If we were to incur a significant liability pursuant to environmental laws or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 Our operations are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety, including chemical accident prevention. We maintain safety, training and maintenance programs as part of our ongoing efforts to comply with applicable laws and regulations but cannot guarantee that these efforts will always be successful. Compliance with applicable health and safety laws and regulations has required and continues to require substantial expenditures. Failure to appropriately manage occupational health and safety risks associated with our business could also adversely impact our employees, communities, reputation and results of operations. 
 
 We may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from performance of pipeline integrity programs and related repairs. 
 
 We are regulated under federal pipeline safety statutes by DOT through the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration PHMSA ). PHMSA sets and enforces pipeline safety regulations. Failure to comply with PHMSA or comparable state pipeline safety regulations could result in a number of consequences which may have a materially adverse effect on our operations. PHMSA s enforcement authority includes the ability to assess civil penalties for violations of pipeline safety regulations, issue orders directing compliance, and issue orders directing corrective action to abate hazardous conditions. Among other things, pipeline safety laws and regulations require pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures for pipelines located in high consequence areas, which are areas where a release could have the most significant adverse consequences, including certain population areas, certain drinking water sources and unusually sensitive ecological areas. These regulations require operators of covered pipelines to perform a variety of heightened assessment, analysis, prevention and repair activities on the segments of pipe located within high 
 - 36 - 

consequence areas. Routine assessments under the integrity management program may result in findings that require repairs or other actions. 
 
 Moreover, changes to pipeline safety laws by Congress and regulations by PHMSA or states that result in more stringent or costly pipeline integrity management or safety standards could possibly have a substantial effect on us and similarly situated midstream operators. In December 2020, Congress passed the PIPES Act, some elements of which could affect our operations. Further, PHMSA adopted new regulations related to Valve Installation and Minimum Rupture Detection Standards, which became effective on October 5, 2022. These regulations expand PHMSA's regulation of the safety of hazardous liquid pipelines by establishing certain new procedural and notification requirements for managing rupture events, and requiring the installation of rupture-mitigation valves on new or certain replaced pipelines. This final rule may result in additional capital and operations and maintenance costs in the coming years. Additionally, where PHMSA has not pursued any legal requirements, state agencies, to the extent authorized, could enact regulatory standards for certain pipelines. 
 
 Rate regulation, changes to rate-making rules, or a successful challenge to the rates we charge on our pipeline systems may reduce our revenues and the amount of cash we generate. 
 
 For a general overview of federal and state regulations applicable to our pipeline assets, see Overview Governmental Regulation included within Part I, Items 1 and 2 Business and Properties of this annual report. The federal and state regulations that apply to our pipeline assets can affect certain aspects of our business and the market for our products and can have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 The FERC, pursuant to the ICA and the rules and orders promulgated thereunder, regulates the tariff rates and terms and conditions of service on our interstate liquids pipelines. To be lawful under the ICA, tariff rates and terms and conditions of service must be on file at FERC, just and reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory. Shippers may protest (and the FERC may investigate) the lawfulness of new or changed tariff rates. The FERC can suspend those tariff rates for up to seven months. It can also require refunds of amounts collected (including interest) pursuant to rates that are ultimately found to be unlawful and prescribe new rates prospectively. The FERC and interested parties can also challenge tariff rates and provisions that have become final and effective. The FERC can also order new rates to take effect prospectively and order reparations (plus interest) for past rates that exceed the just and reasonable level up to two years prior to the date of a complaint. 
 
 The FERC uses prescribed rate methodologies for approving regulated tariff rate changes for interstate liquids pipelines. These methodologies may limit our ability to set rates based on our actual costs or may delay the use of rates reflecting increased costs. We believe the transportation rates currently charged by our interstate liquids pipelines are in accordance with the ICA and applicable FERC regulations. However, due to the complexity of rate making, the lawfulness of any rate is never assured. Adverse decisions by the FERC related to our rates could adversely affect our revenue, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, if any of our pipelines were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the ICA, this could result in the imposition of administrative and criminal remedies and civil penalties, as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such services in excess of the rate established by the FERC. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect revenues and cash flow related to the affected assets. 
 
 The intrastate liquids and natural gas pipeline transportation services we provide are subject to various state laws and regulations that apply to the rates we charge and the terms and conditions of the services we offer. These state commissions have generally not been aggressive in regulating common carrier pipelines and generally have not investigated the rates or practices of petroleum pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints. However, a state regulatory commission could investigate our rates if such a challenge were filed and any adverse decisions could adversely affect our revenue, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 
 There are various risks associated with greenhouse gases, climate change legislation or regulations, and increasing societal expectations that companies address climate change that could result in increased operating costs, reduced demand for our services and reduced access to capital markets. 
 
 Climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States. Numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of greenhouse gases. These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, climate-related disclosure obligations, and regulations that directly limit greenhouse gas emissions from certain sources. While it presently appears unlikely that comprehensive climate change legislation will be passed by Congress in the near future, energy legislation and other regulatory initiatives are expected to be proposed that may be relevant to greenhouse gas emissions issues. Moreover, in 2021, President Biden issued several executive orders that committed to substantial action on climate change and released The Long-Term Strategy of the United States: Pathways to Net-Zero Greenhouse Gas Emissions by 2050, which establishes a roadmap to net zero emissions in the United States by 2050 through, among other things, improving energy efficiency, decarbonizing energy sources via electricity, hydrogen, and sustainable biofuels, eliminating subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry, and increased emphasis on climate-related risk across governmental agencies and economic sectors. As 
 - 37 - 

a result, our operations, and those of our customers, are subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation, and financial risks associated with the transport of fossil fuels and emission of greenhouse gases. 
 
 The EPA has adopted rules that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for greenhouse gas emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas sources in the United States or require control or reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases, including methane, from such sources. In 2021, the EPA announced its intent to reconsider and revise rules related to the oil and gas sector (primarily oil production and natural gas production, distribution, and storage) to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and on December 6, 2022, the EPA proposed a supplement that would revise and expand the 2021 proposal. Separately, the Bureau of Land Management BLM has also proposed rules to limit venting, flaring, and methane leaks for oil and gas operations on federal lands, which could in turn adversely impact production of oil and gas on federal lands and reduce demand for the services we provide in those areas. More recently, in January 2023, the CEQ released updated guidance for agency consideration of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change impacts in environmental reviews, which includes, among other recommendations, best practices for analyzing and communicating climate change effects. In addition, the EPA, together with the DOT, implemented greenhouse gas emission and corporate average fuel economy standards for vehicles manufactured in the United States, which standards were revised in December 2021 to impose more stringent requirements for emissions reductions. President Biden also reinstated the Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases in 2021 and directed the group to publish interim estimates of the social cost of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane, with a view to using such estimates in federal rulemakings greenhouse gases, which it did. In November 2022, the EPA published a draft report assigning new and higher social cost values to greenhouse gas emissions for use in its rulemaking initiatives. These and other federal efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector could increase our operating costs or reduce demand for our customers products. 
 
 In March 2022, the SEC issued proposed rules that, if adopted, would require public companies to include certain climate-related disclosures in their registration statements and periodic reports, including information about climate-related risks, climate-related financial statement metrics, and greenhouse gas emissions. In November 2022, the Biden Administration issued a proposed rule that would require government contractors to publicly disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and set emissions reduction targets, which could affect us if we enter into contractual and business arrangements with government contractors. 
 
 Internationally, the United Nations-sponsored Paris Agreement requires member nations to submit non-binding, individually determined emissions reduction goals every five years after 2020. In 2021, the United States rejoined the Paris Agreement and issued its corresponding nationally determined contribution NDC to reduce economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions 50-52 below 2005 levels by 2030. While the NDC does not identify specific actions necessary to achieve these reductions, it lists several sectors as pathways for reductions, including the power, transportation, building, industrial, and agricultural sectors. The administration has acknowledged that a combination of regulatory actions and legislation will be necessary to achieve the U.S. NDC. In regards to legislation, in November 2021 the United States enacted a nearly 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law, which provided significant funding for electric vehicles and clean energy technologies, and in August 2022 the United States enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which allocated 369 billion to climate change and environmental initiatives, including transportation electrification, fees on and greater regulation of methane emissions, and support for green energy manufacturing programs. Certain of these initiatives are subject to ongoing litigation, and the impacts of these international initiatives and the terms of any legislation or regulation to implement the United States commitment under the Paris Agreement remain unclear at this time. 
 
 Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as greenhouse gas cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, restriction of emissions, electric vehicle mandates and combustion engine phaseouts. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the crude oil and refined products that we deliver. 
 
 Increasing societal expectations that companies address climate change, including international, federal, state and local rules and regulations relating to climate change driven by such societal expectations, and use of substitutes for energy commodities may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our customers products and our services, reduced profits, increased investigations and litigation, diversion of financial resources from other initiatives and negative impacts on our unit price and access to capital markets. To the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed on us without regard to our causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. In addition, certain capital markets participants, including certain institutional investors and indices, have been divesting and promoting divestment of or screening out of fossil fuel equities, which could have a negative impact on our unit price and our access to and costs of capital. There is also the possibility that financial institutions may be pressured or required to adopt policies that limit funding for fossil fuel energy companies. For example, in January 2023 the Federal Reserve published instructions for its pilot climate scenario analysis exercise, which the six largest American banks are required to complete by July 31, 2023. Any material reduction in the capital available to the fossil fuel industry could make it more difficult 
 - 38 - 

to secure funding for exploration, development, production, transportation, and processing activities, which could adversely impact our business and operations. 
 
 Finally, increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods, rising sea levels and other climatic events, as well as chronic shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns. These climatic developments have the potential to cause physical damage to our assets or those of our customers or disrupt our supply chains and thus could have an adverse effect on our operations or demand for our services. Additionally, changing meteorological conditions, particularly temperature, may result in changes to the amount, timing, or location of demand for energy or its production. 
 
 Increasing attention to environmental, social and governance ESG matters may adversely impact our business, financial results, stock price or price of debt securities. 
 
 In recent years the investment community, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, universities, financial institutions, including institutional banks, lenders, and insurance companies, and other groups have become more attentive to ESG and sustainability related practices and have been lobbied intensively, and often publicly, by environmental activists concerned about climate change to limit or curtail activities with fossil fuel energy companies. There has also been an increase in third-party providers of company ESG ratings, and more ESG-focused voting policies among proxy advisory firms, portfolio managers, and institutional investors. As a result, some investors, funds, financial institutions and other capital markets participants may screen companies such as ours for ESG performance before investing in our common stock or debt securities, or lending to us or have imposed restrictions upon or otherwise limited lending to, investing in, or providing insurance coverage for, companies that operate in industries with higher perceived environmental exposure, such as the energy industry. If we are unable to meet the ESG standards or investment, lending, ratings, or voting criteria and policies set by these parties, we may lose investors, investors may allocate a portion of their capital away from us, we may become a target for ESG-focused activism, we may face increased costs of or limitations on access to capital or insurance necessary to sustain or grow our business, the price of our common stock or debt securities may be adversely impacted, demand for our services and refined petroleum products may be adversely impacted, and our reputation may be adversely affected, all of which could adversely impact our future financial results. 
 
 Members of the investment community are also increasing their focus on ESG practices and disclosures, including those related to climate change, GHG emissions targets, business resilience under the assumptions of demand-constrained scenarios, and net-zero ambitions in the energy industry in particular, as well as diversity, equality, and inclusion initiatives, political activities, and governance standards among companies more generally. As a result, we may face increasing pressure or negative publicity regarding our ESG practices and disclosures and demands for ESG-focused engagement from investors, stakeholders, and other interested parties. This could result in higher costs, disruption and diversion of management attention, an increased strain on our resources, and the implementation of certain ESG practices or disclosures that may present a heightened level of legal and regulatory risk, or that threaten our credibility with other investors and stakeholders. 
 
 RISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY, DATA SECURITY AND PRIVACY, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 
 Our business is subject to information technology and cybersecurity risks to operational systems, security systems, infrastructure, and customer data processed by us, third-party vendors or suppliers, and any material failure, weakness, interruption, cyber event, including an incident or breach of security, could prevent us or third parties we rely on from effectively operating our business, harm our reputation or materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 Our business is dependent upon increasingly complex information technology systems and other digital technologies for controlling our plants and pipelines, processing transactions and summarizing and reporting results of operations. The secure collection, processing, maintenance, storage and transmission of information is critical to our operations. We are at risk for interruptions, outages and breaches of operational systems, including business, financial, accounting, data or processing, owned by us or our third-party vendors or suppliers; or third-party data that we process or our third-party partners process on our behalf. Such cyber incidents could materially disrupt or shut down operational systems; result in loss of, access to, or copying or transfer of intellectual property, trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information; compromise certain information of customers, employees, suppliers, drivers or others; and jeopardize the security of our facilities. We monitor our information technology systems on a 24/7 basis in an effort to detect cyberattacks, security breaches or unauthorized access. Preventative and detective measures we utilize include independent cybersecurity audits and penetration tests. We implemented these efforts along with other risk mitigation procedures designed to detect and address unauthorized and damaging activity on our network, stay abreast of the increasing cybersecurity threat landscape and improve our cybersecurity posture, but such efforts will require updates and improvements and there is no guarantee that such measures will be adequate to detect, prevent or mitigate cyber incidents. Any implementation, maintenance, segregation and improvement of our systems may require significant management time, support and cost and may not be effective or adequate. 
 
 - 39 - 

A cyber incident could be caused by disasters, insiders (through inadvertence or with malicious intent) or malicious third parties (including nation-states or nation-state supported actors) using sophisticated, targeted methods to circumvent firewalls, encryption and other security defenses, including hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception that are generally beyond our control despite our implementation of protective measures. While there have been immaterial incidents of unauthorized access to our information technology systems, we have not experienced any material impact on our business or operations from these attacks. In addition, information technology system failures, communications network disruptions (whether intentional by a third party or due to natural disaster), and security breaches could still impact equipment and software used to control plants and pipelines, resulting in improper operation of our assets, potentially including delays in the delivery or availability of our customers products, contamination or degradation of the products we transport, store or distribute, or releases of hydrocarbon products and other damage to our facilities for which we could be held liable. These information technology system failures, communications network disruptions, and security breaches could also cause us to breach our contractual arrangements with other parties, or subject us to regulatory actions or litigation. 
 
 Furthermore, we collect and store sensitive data in the ordinary course of our business, including personally identifiable information of our employees as well as our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers, investors and other stakeholders. We also work with third-party partners that may in the course of their business relationship with us collect, store, process and transmit sensitive data on our behalf and in connection with our products and services offerings. Despite our security measures, ours or our third-party partners' information technology systems may become the target of cyberattacks or security breaches (including employee error, malfeasance or other intentional or unintentional breaches), which are generally beyond our control, which could result in the theft or loss of the stored information, misappropriation of assets, disruption of transactions and reporting functions, our ability to protect confidential information and our financial reporting. Our efforts to improve security and protect data may result in increased capital and operating costs to modify, upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such cyber-attacks and we may face difficulties in fully anticipating or implementing adequate security measures or mitigating potential harm. Moreover, as technologies evolve and cyberattacks become increasingly sophisticated, we may not be able to anticipate, detect or prevent cyberattacks or security breaches, particularly because the methodologies used by attackers change frequently or may not be recognized until after such attack is launched, and because attackers are increasingly using technologies specifically designed to circumvent cybersecurity measures and avoid detection. Even with insurance coverage for cyberattacks, data breaches or unauthorized access of our or a third-party partner s information technology systems, a claim could be denied or coverage delayed. Moreover, it is increasingly difficult to buy sufficient cyber insurance coverages as the insurance market has been limiting both liability under cyber policies and the issuance of said policies, generally. A cyberattack or security breach could result in liability under data privacy laws, regulatory penalties, damage to our reputation, or additional costs for remediation and modification or enhancement of our information systems to prevent future occurrences, all of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 We may be subject to information technology system failures, communications network disruptions and data breaches that are generally beyond our control. 
 
 We depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of third-party hardware and software systems and infrastructure, including our operating, communications and financial reporting systems. We have implemented safeguards and other preventative measures designed to protect our systems and data, however, our information technology systems and communications network, and those of our information technology and communication service providers, remain vulnerable to interruption by natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, vandalism, Internet failures, computer malware, ransomware, cyberattacks, data breaches and other events unforeseen or generally beyond our control. Additionally, the implementation of social distancing measures and other limitations on our employees, service providers and other third parties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have necessitated in certain cases to switching to remote work arrangements on less secure systems and environments. The increase in companies and individuals working remotely has increased the risk of cyberattacks and potential cybersecurity incidents, both deliberate attacks and unintentional events. Any of these events could cause system interruptions, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from operating, which could make our business and services less attractive and subject us to liability. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy. 
 
 In addition, information technology system failures, network disruptions (whether intentional by a third party or due to natural disaster), breaches of network or data security, or disruption or failure of the network system used to monitor and control pipeline and terminal operations could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions, our ability to protect customer or company information and our financial reporting. Although we have taken steps to address these concerns by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control measures, a system failure or data security breach could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Our business is subject to complex and evolving laws, regulations and security standards regarding data privacy, cybersecurity and data protection data protection obligations ). Many of these data protection obligations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, any real or perceived failure to comply with such obligations and could result in 
 - 40 - 

claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations or other harm to our business. 
 
 The constantly evolving regulatory and legislative environment surrounding data privacy and protection poses increasingly complex compliance challenges, and complying with such data protection obligations could increase the costs and complexity of compliance and enforcement risks. While we do not collect significant amounts of personal information from consumers, we do have personal information from our employees, job applicants and some business partners, such as contractors and distributors. Any failure, whether real or perceived, by us to comply with applicable data privacy and protection obligations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and adversely affect our business. Our compliance with emerging data privacy/security laws, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions related to these laws, may increase our operating costs or subject us to legal and reputational risks, including significant awards, fines, civil or criminal penalties or judgments, proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies or customers, class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions and negative publicity. 
 
 In the second quarter of 2021, the Department of Homeland Security s Transportation Security Administration TSA announced two new security directives. These directives require critical pipeline owners to comply with mandatory reporting measures, including, among other things, to appoint personnel, report confirmed and potential cybersecurity incidents to the DHS Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency CISA and provide vulnerability assessments. As legislation continues to develop and cyber incidents continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to respond to cyberattacks, to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures, or to detect, assess, investigate and remediate any critical infrastructure security vulnerabilities and report any cyber incidents to the applicable regulatory authorities. Any failure to maintain compliance with these evolving government regulations may result in enforcement actions which may then result in significant time, support and cost and have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. 

RISKS RELATED TO LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CREDIT 
 
 Increases in interest rates could adversely affect our business. 
 
 We use both fixed and variable rate debt, and we are exposed to market risk due to the floating interest rates on our credit facility. In addition, interest rates on future debt offerings could be higher, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. Our results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be adversely affected by significant increases in interest rates. 
 
 Our leverage may limit our ability to borrow additional funds, comply with the terms of our indebtedness or capitalize on business opportunities. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, the principal amount of our total outstanding debt was 1,556 million. On February 4, 2020, we closed a private placement of 500 million 5.0 senior notes due 2028 (the 5 Senior Notes and on April 8, 2022, we closed a private placement of 400 million 6.375 senior notes due 2027 (the "6.375 Senior Notes, " and together with the 5 Senior Notes, the "Senior Notes"). Various limitations in our Credit Agreement and the indenture for our Senior Notes may reduce our ability to incur additional debt, to engage in some transactions and to capitalize on business opportunities. Any subsequent refinancing of our current indebtedness or any new indebtedness could have similar or greater restrictions. 
 
 Our leverage could have important consequences. We require substantial cash flow to meet our payment obligations with respect to our indebtedness. Our ability to make scheduled payments, to refinance our indebtedness or our ability to obtain additional financing in the future will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to then-current economic conditions and to financial, business, competitive, regulatory and other factors. We believe that we will have sufficient cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our Credit Agreement to service our indebtedness. However, a significant downturn in our business or other development adversely affecting our cash flow could materially impair our ability to service our indebtedness. We cannot guarantee that we would be able to refinance our existing indebtedness at maturity or otherwise or sell assets on terms that are commercially reasonable. 
 
 The instruments governing our debt contain restrictive covenants that may prevent us from engaging in certain transactions. The agreements governing our debt generally require us to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants including the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on incurring additional debt, entering into mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, making investments and granting liens. Our leverage may adversely affect our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general partnership requirements, future acquisitions, construction or development activities, or to otherwise realize fully the value of our assets and opportunities because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness or to comply with any restrictive terms of our indebtedness. Our leverage also may make our results of operations more susceptible to adverse economic and industry conditions by limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and may place us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors that have less debt. 
 - 41 - 

We may not be able to obtain funding on acceptable terms or at all because of volatility and uncertainty in the credit and capital markets. This may hinder or prevent us from meeting our future capital needs. 
 
 The domestic and global financial markets and economic conditions are disrupted and volatile from time to time due to a variety of factors, including low consumer confidence, high unemployment, geoeconomic and geopolitical issues, including U.S. government shutdowns, weak economic conditions and uncertainty in the financial services sector. In addition, the fixed-income markets have experienced periods of extreme volatility, which negatively impacted market liquidity conditions. As a result, the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets has increased substantially at times while the availability of funds from these markets diminished significantly. In particular, as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of lending counterparties specifically, the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets may increase as many lenders and institutional investors increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt on similar terms or at all and reduce, or in some cases cease, to provide funding to borrowers. In addition, lending counterparties under existing revolving credit facilities and other debt instruments may be unwilling or unable to meet their funding obligations. 
 
 Due to these factors, we cannot be certain that new debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms. If funding is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to: 
 
 continue our business as currently structured and/or conducted; 
 meet our obligations as they come due; 
 execute our growth strategy; 
 complete future acquisitions or construction projects; 
 take advantage of other business opportunities; or 
 respond to competitive pressures. 
 
 Any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. 
 
 If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, our ability to pay quarterly distributions to our common unitholders at current levels or to increase our quarterly distributions in the future could be impaired materially. 
 
 Our ability to pay quarterly distributions depends primarily on cash flow (including cash flow from operations, financial reserves and credit facilities) and not solely on profitability, which is affected by non-cash items. As a result, we may pay cash distributions during periods of losses and may be unable to pay cash distributions during periods of income. Our ability to generate sufficient cash from operations is largely dependent on our ability to manage our business successfully which may also be affected by economic, financial, competitive, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. Because the cash we generate from operations will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, quarterly distributions may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter. 
 
 We are exposed to the credit risks and certain other risks, of our or our joint ventures' key customers, vendors, and other counterparties. 
 
 We are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our or our joint ventures' customers, vendors or other counterparties. We and our joint ventures derive a significant portion of our revenues from contracts with key customers, particularly HF Sinclair, under its pipelines and terminals, tankage, tolling and throughput agreements. To the extent that our or our joint ventures' customers are unable to meet the specifications of their customers, we would be adversely affected unless we were able to make comparably profitable arrangements with other customers. 
 
 Mergers among our existing customers could provide strong economic incentives for the combined entities to use systems other than ours, and we could experience difficulty in replacing lost volumes and revenues. Because a significant portion of our operating costs are fixed, a reduction in volumes would result not only in a reduction of revenues, but also a decline in net income and cash flow of a similar magnitude, which would reduce our ability to meet our financial obligations and make distributions to unitholders. 
 
 If any of our or our joint ventures' key customers default on their obligations, our financial results could be adversely affected. Furthermore, some of our or our joint ventures' customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks. In addition, nonperformance by vendors who have committed to provide us with products or services could result in higher costs or interfere with our ability to successfully conduct our business. 
 
 Any substantial increase in the nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our or our joint ventures' customers or vendors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 - 42 - 

In addition, in connection with the acquisition of certain of our assets, we have entered into agreements pursuant to which various counterparties, including HF Sinclair, have agreed to indemnify us, subject to certain limitations, for: 
 
 certain pre-closing environmental liabilities discovered within specified time periods after the date of the applicable acquisition; 
 certain matters arising from the pre-closing ownership and operation of assets; and 
 ongoing remediation related to the assets. 
 
 Our business, results of operation, cash flows and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders could be adversely affected in the future if third parties fail to satisfy an indemnification obligation owed to us. 
 
 Adverse changes in our and/or our general partner's credit ratings and risk profile may negatively affect us. 
 
 Our ability to access capital markets is important to our ability to operate our business. Regional and national economic conditions, increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes, as well as changes in our economic performance, could result in credit agencies reexamining our credit rating. 
 
 We are in compliance with all covenants or other requirements set forth in our Credit Agreement. Further, we do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would automatically accelerate the maturity dates of any debt. 
 
 While credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance, a downgrade in our credit rating could affect adversely our ability to borrow on, renew existing, or obtain access to new financing arrangements, could increase the cost of such financing arrangements, could reduce our level of capital expenditures and could impact our future earnings and cash flows. 
 
 The credit and business risk profiles of our general partner, and of HF Sinclair as the indirect owner of our general partner, may be factors in credit evaluations of us as a master limited partnership due to the significant influence of our general partner and its indirect ownership over our business activities, including our cash distribution policy, acquisition strategy and business risk profile. Another factor that may be considered is the financial condition of our general partner and its owners, including the degree of their financial leverage and their dependence on cash flow from the partnership to service their indebtedness. 
 
 RISKS TO COMMON UNITHOLDERS 
 
 HF Sinclair and its affiliates may have conflicts of interest and limited fiduciary duties, which may permit them to favor their own interests. 
 
 Currently, HF Sinclair and certain of its subsidiaries collectively own a 47 limited partner interest and a non-economic general partner interest in us and controls HLS, the general partner of our general partner, HEP Logistics. Conflicts of interest may arise between HF Sinclair and its affiliates, including our general partner, on the one hand, and us, on the other hand. As a result of these conflicts, the general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its other affiliates over our interests. These conflicts include, among others, the following situations: 
 
 HF Sinclair, as a shipper on our pipelines, has an economic incentive not to cause us to seek higher tariff rates or terminalling fees, even if such higher rates or terminalling fees would reflect rates that could be obtained in arm's -length, third-party transactions; 
 HF Sinclair's directors and officers have a fiduciary duty to make business decisions in the best interests of the stockholders of HF Sinclair; 
 our general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us, such as HF Sinclair, in resolving conflicts of interest; 
 our partnership agreement provides for modified or reduced fiduciary duties for our general partner, and also restricts the remedies available to our unitholders for actions that, without the limitations, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty; 
 our general partner determines which costs incurred by HF Sinclair and its affiliates are reimbursable by us; 
 our partnership agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf; 
 our general partner may, in some circumstances, cause us to borrow funds to make cash distributions, even where the purpose or effect of the borrowing benefits our general partner or affiliates; 
 our general partner determines the amount and timing of our asset purchases and sales, capital expenditures and borrowings, each of which can affect the amount of cash available to us; and 
 our general partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by our general partner and its affiliates, including the pipelines and terminals agreement with HF Sinclair. 
 
 - 43 - 

Cost reimbursements, which will be determined by our general partner, and fees due to our general partner and its affiliates for services provided, are substantial. 
 
 Under our Omnibus Agreement, we are obligated to pay HF Sinclair an administrative fee of currently 5.0 million per year for the provision by HF Sinclair or its affiliates of various general and administrative services for our benefit. The administrative fee is subject to an annual upward adjustment for changes in PPI. In addition, we are required to reimburse HF Sinclair pursuant to the secondment arrangement for the wages, benefits, and other costs of HF Sinclair employees seconded to HLS to perform services at certain of our processing, refining, pipeline and tankage assets. We can neither provide assurance that HF Sinclair will continue to provide us the officers and employees that are necessary for the conduct of our business nor that such provision will be on terms that are acceptable to us. If HF Sinclair fails to provide us with adequate personnel, our operations could be adversely impacted. 
 
 The administrative fee and secondment allocations are subject to annual review and may increase if we make an acquisition that requires an increase in the level of general and administrative services that we receive from HF Sinclair or its affiliates. For example, in connection with the HEP Transaction, we paid HF Sinclair a temporary monthly fee of 62,500 through November 30, 2022 relating to transition services provided to us by HF Sinclair. Our general partner will determine the amount of general and administrative expenses that will be allocated to us in accordance with the terms of our partnership agreement. In addition, our general partner and its affiliates are entitled to reimbursement for all other expenses they incur on our behalf, including the salaries of and the cost of employee benefits for employees of HLS who provide services to us. 
 
 Prior to making any distribution on the common units, we will reimburse our general partner and its affiliates, including officers and directors of the general partner, for all expenses incurred on our behalf, plus the administrative fee. The reimbursement of expenses and the payment of fees could adversely affect our ability to make distributions. The general partner has sole discretion to determine the amount of these expenses. Our general partner and its affiliates also may provide us other services for which we are charged fees as determined by our general partner. 
 
 Increases in interest rates could adversely impact our unit price and our ability to issue additional equity to make acquisitions, fund expansion capital expenditures, or for other purposes. 
 
 As with other yield-oriented securities, our unit price is impacted by the level of our cash distributions and implied distribution yield. The distribution yield is often used by investors to compare and rank related yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. Therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our units and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our unit price and our ability to issue additional equity to make acquisitions, fund expansion capital expenditures or for other purposes. If we then issue additional equity at a significantly lower price, material dilution to our existing unitholders could result. 
 
 Even if unitholders are dissatisfied, they cannot remove our general partner without its consent. 
 
 Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence management's decisions regarding our business. Unitholders did not elect our general partner or the board of directors of HLS and have no right to do so on an annual or other continuing basis. The board of directors of HLS is chosen by the sole member of HLS. If unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner, they will have little ability to remove our general partner. As a result of these limitations, the price at which the common units trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price. 
 
 The vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3 of all outstanding units voting together as a single class is required to remove the general partner. Unitholders will be unable to remove the general partner without its consent because the general partner and its affiliates own sufficient units to prevent its removal. Unitholders' voting rights are further restricted by the partnership agreement provision providing that any units held by a person that owns 20 or more of any class of units then outstanding (other than the general partner, its affiliates, their transferees, and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of the board of directors of the general partner's general partner) cannot vote on any matter; however, no such person currently exists. Our partnership agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings, acquire information about our operations, and influence the manner or direction of management. 
 
 The control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent. 
 
 Our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of the unitholders. Furthermore, our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of the partners of our general partner from transferring their respective partnership interests in our general partner to a third party. The new partners of our general partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and officers of the general partner of our general partner with their own choices and to control the decisions made by the board of directors and officers. 
 - 44 - 

We may issue additional limited partner units without unitholder approval, which would dilute an existing unitholder's ownership interests. 
 
 Under our partnership agreement, provided there is no significant decrease in our operating performance, we may issue an unlimited number of limited partner interests of any type without the approval of our unitholders, and HEP currently has a shelf registration on file with the SEC pursuant to which it may issue up to 2.0 billion in additional common units. On May 10, 2016, HEP established a continuous offering program under the shelf registration statement pursuant to which HEP may issue and sell common units from time to time, representing limited partner interests, up to an aggregate gross sales amount of 200 million. As of December 31, 2022, HEP has issued 2.4 million units under this program for gross consideration of 82.3 million. No units were issued under the program during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 The issuance by us of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects: 
 
 our unitholders' proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease; 
 the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease; 
 the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished; and 
 the market price of the common units may decline. 
 
 Our partnership agreement does not give our unitholders the right to approve our issuance of equity securities ranking junior to the common units at any time. 
 
 In establishing cash reserves, our general partner may reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders. 
 
 Our partnership agreement requires us to distribute all available cash to our unitholders; however, it also requires our general partner to deduct from operating surplus cash reserves that it establishes are necessary to fund our future operating expenditures. In addition, our partnership agreement permits our general partner to reduce available cash by establishing cash reserves for the proper conduct of our business, to comply with applicable law or agreements to which we are a party, or to provide funds for future distributions to partners. These cash reserves will affect the amount of cash available to make the required payments to our debt holders or distributions on our common units every quarter. 
 
 HF Sinclair and its affiliates may engage in limited competition with us. 
 
 HF Sinclair and its affiliates may engage in limited competition with us. Pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement, HF Sinclair and its affiliates agreed not to engage in the business of operating intermediate or refined product pipelines or terminals, crude oil pipelines or terminals, truck racks or crude oil gathering systems in the continental United States. The Omnibus Agreement, however, does not apply to: 
 
 any business operated by HF Sinclair or any of its subsidiaries at the closing of our initial public offering; 
 any business or asset that HF Sinclair or any of its subsidiaries acquires or constructs that has a fair market value or construction cost of less than 5 million; and 
 any business or asset that HF Sinclair or any of its subsidiaries acquires or constructs that has a fair market value or construction cost of 5 million or more if we have been offered the opportunity to purchase the business or asset at fair market value, and we decline to do so. 
 
 In the event that HF Sinclair or its affiliates no longer control our partnership or there is a change of control of HF Sinclair, the non-competition provisions of the Omnibus Agreement will terminate. 
 
 Our general partner has a limited call right that may require a unitholder to sell its common units at an undesirable time or price. 
 
 If at any time our general partner and its affiliates own more than 80 of the common units (which it does not presently), our general partner will have the right (which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us) but not the obligation to acquire all, but not less than all, of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price not less than their then-current market price. As a result, a holder of common units may be required to sell its units at a time or price that is undesirable to it and may not receive any return on its investment. A common unitholder may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of its units. 
 
 - 45 - 

A unitholder may not have limited liability if a court finds that unitholder actions constitute control of our business or that we have not complied with state partnership law. 
 
 Under Delaware law, a unitholder could be held liable for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if a court determined that the right of unitholders to remove our general partner or to take other action under our partnership agreement constituted participation in the control of our business. Our general partner generally has unlimited liability for our obligations, such as our debts and environmental liabilities, except for those contractual obligations that are expressly made without recourse to our general partner. 
 
 In addition, Section 17-607 and 17-804 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act provides that under some circumstances, a unitholder may be liable to us for the amount of a distribution for a period of three years from the date of the distribution. 
 
 Further, we conduct business in a number of states. In some of those states the limitations on the liability of limited partners for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established. The unitholders might be held liable for the partnership's obligations as if they were a general partner if a court or government agency determined that we were conducting business in the state but had not complied with the state's partnership statute. 
 
 HF Sinclair and our other significant unitholders may sell our common units in the public or private markets, and such sales could have an adverse impact on the trading price of our common units. Additionally, HF Sinclair may pledge or hypothecate its common units or its interest in us. 
 
 As of February 15, 2023, HF Sinclair held 59,630,030 of our common units and REH Company, our next largest unitholder, held 21,000,000 of our common units, which is approximately 47 and 16.6 of our outstanding common units, respectively. The sale of these common units (or the perception that these sales may occur) in the public or private markets by HF Sinclair or REH Company could have an adverse impact on the trading price of our common units. Additionally, we agreed to provide both HF Sinclair and REH Company registration rights with respect to our common units that they hold. HF Sinclair may pledge or hypothecate its common units, and such pledge or hypothecation may include terms and conditions that might result in an adverse impact on the trading price of our common units. 
 
 TAX RISKS TO COMMON UNITHOLDERS 
 
 Our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and not being subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation by individual states. If the IRS were to treat us as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or if we were to become subject to additional amounts of entity-level taxation for federal or state tax purposes, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders could be substantially reduced. 
 
 The anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 
 Despite the fact that we are organized as a limited partnership under Delaware law, we would be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless we satisfy a qualifying income requirement. Based upon our current operations and current Treasury Regulations, we believe we satisfy the qualifying income requirement. Failing to meet the qualifying income requirement or a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity. 
 
 If we were treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would pay U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate. Distributions to unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses or deductions would flow through to unitholders. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to unitholders would be substantially reduced. Therefore, our treatment as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units. 
 
 At the entity level, if we were subject to U.S. federal income tax, we would also be subject to the income tax provisions of many states. Moreover, states are evaluating ways to independently subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income taxes, franchise taxes and other forms of taxation. For example, we are required to pay Texas margin tax on any income apportioned to Texas, despite our status as a partnership. Imposition of any additional such taxes or an increase in the existing tax rates could reduce the cash available for distributions to our unitholders. Our partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity-level taxation for federal, state or local income tax purposes, the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us. 
 - 46 - 

The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes or differing interpretations, possibly applied on a retroactive basis. 
 
 The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial changes and differing interpretations at any time. Members of Congress have frequently proposed and considered similar substantive changes to the existing U.S. federal income tax laws that would affect publicly traded partnerships, including proposals that would eliminate our ability to qualify for partnership tax treatment. 
 
 In addition, the Treasury Department has issued, and in the future may issue, regulations interpreting those laws that affect publicly traded partnerships. There can be no assurance that there will not be further changes to U.S. federal income tax laws or the Treasury Department s interpretation of the qualifying income rules in a manner that could impact our ability to qualify as a partnership in the future, which could also negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units. Any modification to the U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible for us to meet the qualifying income requirement to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict whether any changes or proposals will ultimately be enacted. You are urged to consult with your own tax advisor with respect to the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on your investment in our common units. 
 
 If the IRS contests the U.S. federal income tax positions we take, the market for our common units may be adversely impacted, and the cost of any IRS contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders. 
 
 The IRS may adopt positions that differ from the positions we have taken or may take on tax matters. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take, and a court may not agree with some or all of the positions we take. Any contest with the IRS may materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the price at which they trade. In addition, the costs of any contest with the IRS would be borne indirectly by our unitholders and general partner because the costs will reduce our cash available for distribution. 
 
 If the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, it (and some states) may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustment directly from us, in which case our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced, and our current and former unitholders may be required to indemnify us for any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustments that were paid on their behalf. 
 
 Pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns, it (and some states) may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustment directly from us. Under our partnership agreement, our general partner is permitted to make elections under these rules to either pay the taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly to the IRS or, if we are eligible, issue a revised information statement to each affected current and former unitholder with respect to an audited and adjusted return. Although our general partner may elect to have our affected current and former unitholders take such audit adjustment into account and pay any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) in accordance with their interests in us during the tax year under audit, there can be no assurance that such election will be practical, permissible or effective in all circumstances. As a result, our current unitholders may bear some or all of the tax liability resulting from such audit adjustment, even if such unitholders did not own units in us during the tax year under audit. If, as a result of any such audit adjustment, we are required to make payments of taxes, penalties or interest, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced, and our current and former unitholders may be required to indemnify us for any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustments that were paid on their behalf. These rules are not applicable for tax years beginning on or prior to December 31, 2017. 
 
 Even if unitholders do not receive any cash distributions from us, they will be required to pay taxes on their share of our taxable income. 
 
 Unitholders will be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes, on their share of our taxable income, whether or not they receive cash distributions from us. For example, if we sell assets and use the proceeds to repay existing debt or fund capital expenditures, unitholders may be allocated taxable income and gain resulting from the sale and our cash available for distribution would not increase. Unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax due from the unitholder with respect to that income. 
 
 - 47 - 

Tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected. 
 
 If a unitholder disposes of common units, it will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and its tax basis in those common units. Because distributions in excess of a unitholder's allocable share of our net taxable income result in a decrease of the unitholder's tax basis in its common units, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to the units sold will, in effect, become taxable income to the unitholder if it sells such units at a price greater than its tax basis in those units, even if the price the unitholder receives is less than its original cost. In addition, because the amount realized includes a unitholder's share of our nonrecourse liabilities, if unitholders sell their units, they may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash they receive from the sale. 
 
 A substantial portion of the amount realized from the sale of a unitholder's common units, whether or not representing gain, may be taxed as ordinary income to the unitholder due to potential recapture items, including depreciation recapture. Thus, the unitholder may recognize both ordinary income and capital loss from the sale of such units if the amount realized on a sale of such units is less than the unitholder's adjusted basis in the units. Net capital loss may only offset capital gains and, in the case of individuals, up to 3,000 of ordinary income per year. In the taxable period in which the unitholder sells its units, the unitholder may recognize ordinary income from our allocations of income and gain to the unitholder prior to the sale and from recapture items that generally cannot be offset by any capital loss recognized upon the sale of units. 
 
 Unitholders may be subject to limitation on their ability to deduct interest expense incurred by us. 
 
 We are generally entitled to a deduction for interest paid or accrued on indebtedness properly allocable to our trade or business during our taxable year. However, our deduction for business interest is limited to the sum of our business interest income and 30 of our adjusted taxable income. For the purposes of this limitation, our adjusted taxable income is computed without regard to any business interest expense or business interest income. 
 
 If our business interest is subject to limitation under these rules, it could result in an increase in the taxable income allocable to a unitholder for such taxable year without any corresponding increase in the cash available for distribution to such unitholder. 
 
 Tax-exempt entities face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them. 
 
 Investment in our common units by tax-exempt entities, such as employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts (known as IRAs) raises issues unique to them. For example, virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from U.S. federal income tax, including IRAs and other retirement plans, will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them. Tax-exempt entities should consult a tax advisor before investing in our common units. 
 
 Non-U.S. unitholders will be subject to U.S. taxes and withholding with respect to their income and gain from owning our units. 
 
 Non-U.S. unitholders are generally taxed and subject to U.S. income tax filing requirements on income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business effectively connected income ). Income allocated to our unitholders and any gain from the sale of our units will generally be considered to be effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. As a result, distributions to a non-U.S. unitholder will be subject to withholding at the highest applicable effective tax rate, and a non-U.S. unitholder who sells or otherwise disposes of a unit will also be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the gain realized from the sale or disposition of that unit. In addition to the withholding tax imposed on distributions of effectively connected income, distributions to a non-U.S. unitholder will also be subject to a 10 withholding tax on the amount of any distribution in excess of our cumulative net income. As we do not compute our cumulative net income for such purposes due to the complexity of the calculation and lack of clarity in how it would apply to us, we intend to treat all of our distributions as being in excess of our cumulative net income for such purposes and subject to such 10 withholding tax. Accordingly, distributions to a non-U.S. unitholder will be subject to a combined withholding tax rate equal to the sum of the highest applicable effective tax rate and 10 . 
 
 Moreover, the transferee of an interest in a partnership that is engaged in a U.S. trade or business is generally required to withhold 10 of the amount realized by the transferor unless the transferor certifies that it is not a foreign person. While the determination of a partner s amount realized generally includes any decrease of a partner s share of the partnership s liabilities, the Treasury Regulations provide that the amount realized on a transfer of an interest in a publicly traded partnership, such as our common units, will generally be the amount of gross proceeds paid to the broker effecting the applicable transfer on behalf of the transferor, and thus will be determined without regard to any decrease in that partner s share of a publicly traded partnership s liabilities. For a transfer of interests in a publicly traded partnership that is effected through a broker on or after January 1, 2023, the obligation to withhold is imposed on the transferor s broker. Current and prospective foreign unitholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the impact of these rules on an investment in our common units. 
 - 48 - 

We treat each purchaser of common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the common units. 
 
 Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units, we have adopted depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing Treasury Regulations. A successful IRS challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to our unitholders. It also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from unitholders' sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments. 
 
 We generally prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders. 
 
 We generally prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month (the Allocation Date instead of on the date a particular unit is transferred. Similarly, we generally allocate certain deductions for depreciation of capital additions, gain or loss realized on a sale or other disposition of our assets and, in the discretion of the general partner, any other extraordinary item of income, gain, loss or deduction based upon ownership on the Allocation Date. Treasury Regulations allow a similar monthly simplifying convention, but such regulations do not specifically authorize all aspects of our proration method. If the IRS were to challenge our proration method, we may be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders. 
 
 A unitholder whose units are the subject of a securities loan (e.g., a loan to a short seller to cover a short sale of units) may be considered as having disposed of those units. If so, it would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition. 
 
 Because there are no specific rules governing the U.S. federal income tax consequences of loaning a partnership interest, a unitholder whose units are the subject of a securities loan may be considered as having disposed of the loaned units. In that case, such unitholder may no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition. Moreover, during the period of the loan, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those units could be fully taxable as ordinary income. Unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a securities loan are urged to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their units. 
 
 Unitholders likely will be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in jurisdictions where they do not live as a result of investing in our common units. 
 
 In addition to U.S. federal income tax, unitholders likely will be subject to other taxes, such as state and local income taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance, or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property now or in the future. Unitholders likely will be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions, even if they do not live in these jurisdictions. Further, unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. We currently own property and conduct business in multiple states. Many of these states currently impose a personal income tax on individuals. As we make acquisitions or expand our business, we may own assets or conduct business in additional states that impose a personal income tax. Unitholders should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the filing of such tax returns, the payment of such taxes, and the deductibility of any taxes paid.

 OVERVIEW 
 
 HEP, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, is a publicly held master limited partnership. On March 14, 2022 (the Closing Date ), HFC and HEP announced the establishment of HF Sinclair, as the new parent holding company of HFC and HEP and their subsidiaries, and the completion of their respective acquisitions of Sinclair Oil Corporation (now known as Sinclair Oil LLC ("Sinclair Oil")) and Sinclair Transportation from REH Company (formerly known as The Sinclair Companies, and referred to herein as REH Company ). On the Closing Date, HF Sinclair completed its acquisition of Sinclair Oil by effecting (a) a holding company merger with HFC surviving such merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of HF Sinclair (the HFC Merger ), and (b) immediately following the HFC Merger, a contribution whereby REH Company contributed all of the equity interests of Hippo Holding LLC (now known as Sinclair Holding LLC), the parent company of Sinclair Oil (the Target Company ), to HF Sinclair in exchange for shares of HF Sinclair, resulting in the Target Company becoming a direct wholly owned subsidiary of HF Sinclair (together with the HFC Merger, the HFC Transactions ). 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, HF Sinclair and its subsidiaries owned a 47 limited partner interest and the non-economic general partner interest in HEP. 
 
 Additionally, on the Closing Date and immediately prior to consummation of the HFC Transactions, HEP acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Sinclair Transportation from REH Company in exchange for 21 million newly issued common limited partner units of HEP (the HEP Units ), representing 16.6 of the pro forma outstanding HEP Units with a value of approximately 349 million based on HEP s fully diluted common limited partner units outstanding and closing unit price on March 11, 2022, and cash consideration equal to 329.0 million, inclusive of final working capital adjustments for an aggregate transaction value of 678.0 million (the HEP Transaction and together with the HFC Transactions, the Sinclair Transactions ). The cash consideration was funded through a draw under HEP s senior secured revolving credit facility. The HEP Transaction was conditioned on the closing of the HFC Transactions, which occurred immediately following the HEP Transaction. 
 
 Sinclair Transportation, together with its subsidiaries, owned REH Company s integrated crude and refined products pipelines and terminal assets, including approximately 1,200 miles of integrated crude and refined product pipeline supporting the REH Company refineries and other third-party refineries, eight product terminals and two crude terminals with approximately 4.5 million barrels of operated storage. In addition, HEP acquired Sinclair Transportation s interests in three pipeline joint ventures for crude gathering and product offtake including: Saddle Butte Pipeline III, LLC (25.06 non-operated interest); Pioneer Investments Corp. (49.995 non-operated interest); and UNEV Pipeline, LLC ("UNEV") (the 25 non-operated interest not already owned by HEP, resulting in UNEV becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of HEP). 
 
 See Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisitions. 
 
 Through our subsidiaries and joint ventures, we own and/or operate petroleum product and crude oil pipelines, terminal, tankage and loading rack facilities and refinery processing units that support the refining and marketing operations of HF Sinclair and other refineries in the Mid-Continent, Southwest and Northwest regions of the United States. HEP, through its 
 - 52 - 

subsidiaries and joint ventures, owns and/or operates petroleum product and crude pipelines, tankage and terminals in Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming as well as refinery processing units in Utah and Kansas. 
 
 We generate revenues by charging tariffs for transporting petroleum products and crude oil through our pipelines, by charging fees for terminalling and storing refined products and other hydrocarbons, providing other services at our storage tanks and terminals and charging a tolling fee per barrel or thousand standard cubic feet of feedstock throughput in our refinery processing units. We do not take ownership of products that we transport, terminal, store or process, and therefore, we are not directly exposed to changes in commodity prices. 
 
 We believe the long-term global refined product demand and U.S. crude production should support high utilization rates for the refineries we serve, which in turn should support volumes in our product pipelines, crude gathering systems and terminals. 
 
 Market Developments 
 Our results for the year ended December 31, 2022 were favorably impacted by global demand for transportation fuels, lubricants and transportation and terminal services having returned to pre-pandemic levels. We expect our customers will continue to adjust refinery production levels commensurate with market demand. The extent to which HEP s future results are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or volatile regional and global economic conditions will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control. However, we have long-term customer contracts with minimum volume commitments, which have expiration dates from 2023 to 2037. These minimum volume commitments accounted for approximately 70 o f our total tariffs and fees billed to customers for both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. We are currently not aware of any reasons that would prevent such customers from making the minimum payments required under the contracts or potentially making payments in excess of the minimum payments. In addition to these payments, we also expect to collect payments for services provided to uncommitted shippers. 
 Investment in Joint Venture 
 On October 2, 2019, HEP Cushing LLC HEP Cushing ), a wholly owned subsidiary of HEP, and Plains Marketing, L.P., a wholly owned subsidiary of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. Plains ), formed a 50/50 joint venture, Cushing Connect Pipeline Terminal LLC (the Cushing Connect Joint Venture ), for (i) the development, construction, ownership and operation of a new 160,000 barrel per day common carrier crude oil pipeline (the Cushing Connect Pipeline that connected the Cushing, Oklahoma crude oil hub to the Tulsa, Oklahoma refining complex owned by a subsidiary of HF Sinclair and (ii) the ownership and operation of 1.5 million barrels of crude oil storage in Cushing, Oklahoma (the Cushing Connect JV Terminal ). The Cushing Connect JV Terminal went in service during the second quarter of 2020, and the Cushing Connect Pipeline was placed into service at the end of the third quarter of 2021. Long-term commercial agreements have been entered into to support the Cushing Connect Joint Venture assets. 
 
 The Cushing Connect Joint Venture contracted with an affiliate of HEP to manage the construction and operation of the Cushing Connect Pipeline and with an affiliate of Plains to manage the operation of the Cushing Connect JV Terminal. The total Cushing Connect Joint Venture investment was generally shared equally among the partners. However, we were solely responsible for any Cushing Connect Pipeline construction costs that exceeded the budget by more than 10 . HEP's share of the cost of the Cushing Connect JV Terminal contributed by Plains and Cushing Connect Pipeline construction costs was approximately 74 million, including approximately 5 million of Cushing Connect Pipeline construction costs that exceeded the budget by more than 10 borne solely by HEP. 
 
 Agreements with HF Sinclair 
 We serve HF Sinclair's refineries under long-term pipeline, terminal, tankage and refinery processing unit throughput agreements expiring from 2023 to 2037. Under these agreements, HF Sinclair agrees to transport, store, and process throughput volumes of refined product, crude oil and feedstocks on our pipelines, terminal, tankage, loading rack facilities and refinery processing units that result in minimum annual payments to us. These minimum annual payments or revenues are subject to annual rate adjustments on July 1st each year based on the PPI or the FERC index. On December 17, 2020, FERC established a new price index for the five-year period commencing July 1, 2021 and ending June 30, 2026, in which common carriers charging indexed rates are permitted to adjust their indexed ceilings annually by Producer Price Index plus 0.78 . FERC received requests for rehearing of its December 17, 2020 order, and on January 20, 2022, FERC revised the index level used to determine annual changes to interstate oil pipeline rate ceilings to Producer Price Index minus 0.21 . The order required the recalculation of the July 1, 2021 index ceilings to be effective as of March 1, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, these agreements with HF Sinclair required minimum annualized payments to us of 453 million. 
 
 - 53 - 

If HF Sinclair fails to meet its minimum volume commitments under the agreements in any quarter, it will be required to pay us the amount of any shortfall in cash by the last day of the month following the end of the quarter. Under certain of the agreements, a shortfall payment may be applied as a credit in the following four quarters after minimum obligations are met. 
 
 A significant reduction in revenues under the HF Sinclair agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 On June 1, 2020, HFC announced plans to permanently cease petroleum refining operations at its Cheyenne refinery (the "Cheyenne Refinery") and to convert certain assets at that refinery to renewable diesel production. HFC subsequently began winding down petroleum refining operations at the Cheyenne Refinery on August 3, 2020. 
 On February 8, 2021, HEP and HFC finalized and executed new agreements for HEP s Cheyenne assets with the following terms, in each case effective January 1, 2021: (1) a ten-year lease with two five-year renewal option periods for HFC s (and now HF Sinclair s) use of certain HEP tank and rack assets in the Cheyenne Refinery to facilitate renewable diesel production with an annual lease payment of approximately 5 million, (2) a five-year contango service fee arrangement that will utilize HEP tank assets inside the Cheyenne Refinery where HFC (and now HF Sinclair) will pay a base tariff to HEP for available crude oil storage and HFC (and now HF Sinclair) and HEP will split any profits generated on crude oil contango opportunities and (3) HFC paid a 10 million one-time cash payment to HEP for the termination of the existing minimum volume commitment. 
 
 Under certain provisions of an omnibus agreement that we have with HF Sinclair Omnibus Agreement ), we pay HF Sinclair an annual administrative fee, currently 5.0 million for the provision by HF Sinclair or its affiliates of various general and administrative services to us. In connection with the HEP Transaction, we paid HF Sinclair a temporary monthly fee of 62,500 through November 30, 2022, relating to transition services provided to HEP by HF Sinclair. Neither the annual administrative fee nor the temporary fee includes the salaries of personnel employed by HF Sinclair who perform services for us on behalf of HLS or the cost of their employee benefits, which are separately charged to us by HF Sinclair. We also reimburse HF Sinclair and its affiliates for direct expenses they incur on our behalf. 
 
 Under HLS s Secondment Agreement with HF Sinclair, certain employees of HF Sinclair are seconded to HLS to provide operational and maintenance services for certain of our processing, refining, pipeline and tankage assets, and HLS reimburses HF Sinclair for its prorated portion of the wages, benefits, and other costs of these employees for our benefit. 
 
 We have a long-term strategic relationship with HFC (and now HF Sinclair) that has historically facilitated our growth. Our future growth plans include organic projects around our existing assets and select investments or acquisitions that enhance our service platform while creating accretion for our unitholders. While in the near term, any acquisitions would be subject to economic conditions discussed in Overview - Market Developments above, we also expect over the longer term to continue to work with HF Sinclair on logistic asset acquisitions in conjunction with HF Sinclair s refinery acquisition strategies. See Overview above for a discussion of the Sinclair Transactions. 
 
 Furthermore, as demonstrated by the HEP Transaction, we plan to continue to pursue third-party logistic asset acquisitions that are accretive to our unitholders and increase the diversity of our revenues. 
 
 A more detailed discussion of our financial condition at December 31, 2022 and 2021 and operating results for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is presented in the following sections.

(1) Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA is calculated as net income attributable to the partners plus or minus (i) interest expense, (ii) interest income, (iii) state income tax expense and (iv) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA plus (i) loss on early extinguishment of debt, (ii) goodwill impairment, (iii) our share of Osage environmental remediation costs, net of insurance recoveries, included in equity in earnings of equity method investments, (iv) acquisition integration and regulatory costs, (v) tariffs and fees not included in revenues due to impacts from lease accounting for certain tariffs and fees minus (vi) gain on sales-type leases, (vii) gain on significant asset sales, (viii) HEP's pro-rata share of gain on business interruption settlement and (ix) pipeline lease payments not included in operating costs and expenses. Portions of our minimum guaranteed tariffs for assets subject to sales-type lease accounting are recorded as interest income with the remaining amounts recorded as a reduction in net investment in leases. Similarly, certain pipeline lease payments were previously recorded as operating costs and expenses, but the underlying lease was reclassified from an operating lease to a financing lease, and these payments are now recorded as interest expense and reductions in the lease liability. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not calculations based upon generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). However, the amounts included in the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA calculations are derived from amounts included in our consolidated financial statements. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net income attributable to the partners or operating income, as indications of our operating performance or as alternatives to operating cash flow as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented here because they are widely used financial indicators used by investors and analysts to measure performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also used by our management for internal analysis and as a basis for compliance with financial covenants. 
 
 (2) Distributable cash flow is not a calculation based upon GAAP. However, the amounts included in the calculation are derived from amounts presented in our consolidated financial statements, with the general exception of maintenance capital expenditures. Distributable cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income or operating income as an indication of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating cash flow as a measure of liquidity. Distributable cash flow is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Distributable cash flow is presented here because it is a widely accepted financial indicator used by investors to compare partnership performance. It is also used by management for internal analysis and for our performance units. We believe that this measure provides investors an enhanced perspective of the operating performance of our assets and the cash our business is generating.

Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2021 
 
 Summary 
 Net income attributable to the partners for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 216.8 million, a 1.8 million increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Results for the year ended December 31, 2022, reflect the impact to our equity in earnings of equity method investments of HEP's 50 share of incurred and estimated environmental remediation and recovery expenses, net of insurance proceeds received to date, associated with a release of crude oil on the Osage Pipe Line Company, LLC ("Osage") pipeline of 17.6 million. In addition, results for the year ended December 31, 2021, reflect special items that collectively increased net income attributable to HEP by a total of 18.9 million. These items included a gain on sales type leases of 24.7 million, a gain on significant asset sales of 5.3 million and a goodwill impairment charge of 11.0 million related to our Cheyenne reporting unit. Excluding these items, net income attributable to the partners for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 234.4 million 1.92 per basic and diluted limited partner unit) compared to 196.0 million 1.86 per basic and diluted limited partner unit) for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in earnings was mainly due to net income from Sinclair Transportation, which was acquired on March 14, 2022, higher revenues on our UNEV pipeline and higher net income from our Cushing Connect Joint Venture as the Cushing Connect pipeline went into service in September 2021; partially offset by higher interest expense and higher operating costs and expenses.

Revenues 
 Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, were 547.5 million, an increase of 53.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was mainly attributable to revenues on our recently acquired Sinclair Transportation assets, increased revenues from our UNEV assets, higher volumes on our crude pipelines in New Mexico, Texas, Wyoming and Utah as well as rate increases that went into effect on July 1, 2022, partially offset by lower revenues on our Cheyenne assets as a result of the conversion of the Cheyenne Refinery to renewable diesel production. The year ended December 31, 2021, included the recognition of the 10 million termination fee related to the termination of HF Sinclair's minimum volume commitment on our Cheyenne assets. 
 Revenues from our refined product pipelines were 113.2 million, an increase of 5.8 million, on shipments averaging 181.3 mbpd compared to 158.1 mbpd for the year ended December 31, 2021. The volume and revenue increases were mainly due to higher volumes on our recently acquired Sinclair Transportation assets and higher volumes on our UNEV pipeline. We recognized a significant portion of the Sinclair Transportation refined product pipeline tariffs as interest income under sales-type lease accounting. 
 Revenues from our intermediate pipelines were 32.2 million, an increase of 2.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Shipments averaged 129.3 mbpd compared to 125.2 mbpd for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in volumes was mainly due to higher throughputs on our intermediate pipelines servicing HF Sinclair's Tulsa and Navajo refineries and the recently acquired Sinclair Transportation intermediate pipelines, and the increase in revenues was mainly due to the recently acquired Sinclair Transportation intermediate pipelines. 
 Revenues from our crude pipelines were 140.0 million, an increase of 14.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Shipments averaged 601.3 mbpd compared to 408.6 mbpd for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in volumes was mainly attributable to our Cushing Connect Pipeline, which went into service in September 2021, volumes on our recently acquired Sinclair Transportation crude pipelines and higher volumes on our crude pipeline systems in New Mexico, Texas, Wyoming and Utah. The increase in revenues was mainly due to our recently acquired Sinclair Transportation crude pipelines and higher volumes on our crude pipelines in New Mexico, Texas, Wyoming and Utah. Revenues did not increase in proportion to volumes due to our recognition of most of the Cushing Connect Pipeline tariffs and a significant portion of the Sinclair Transportation crude pipeline tariffs as interest income under sales-type lease accounting. 
 Revenues from terminal, tankage and loading rack fees were 167.8 million, an increase of 25.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Refined products and crude oil terminalled in the facilities averaged 598.2 mbpd compared to 442.9 mbpd for the year ended December 31, 2021. Volumes increased mainly due to volumes on our recently acquired Sinclair Transportation assets and higher throughputs at HF Sinclair's Tulsa refinery. Revenues increased mainly due to revenues on our recently acquired Sinclair Transportation assets, higher butane blending revenues and higher revenues on our Tulsa assets. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2021 included the recognition of the 10 million termination fee related to the termination of HF Sinclair's minimum volume commitment on our Cheyenne assets as a result of the conversion of the Cheyenne Refinery to renewable diesel production. 
 Revenues from refinery processing units were 94.2 million, an increase of 5.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Throughputs averaged 70.2 mbpd compared to 69.6 mbpd for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in volumes was mainly due to increased throughput for our Woods Cross processing units. Revenues increased mainly due to higher recovery of natural gas costs as well as higher throughputs. 
 Operations Expense 
 Operations (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased by 40.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was mainly due t o operating costs and expenses associated with our recently acquired Sinclair Transportation assets and higher employee costs, utility costs, natural gas costs, and maintenance costs, partially offset by lower general services costs. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased by 5.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was mainly due to depreciation on our recently acquired Sinclair Transportation assets partially offset by the acceleration of depreciation on certain of our Cheyenne tanks in 2021 as well as retirement of assets due to sales-type lease accounting. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased by 4.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 mainly due to integration costs associated with our acquisition of Sinclair Transportation as well as higher fees charged by HF Sinclair under the Omnibus Agreement for the provision of general and administrative services in the year ended December 31, 2022.

Revenues 
 Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, were 494.5 million, a 3.4 million decrease compared to the same period of 2020. The decrease was mainly attributable to lower on-going revenues from our Cheyenne assets as a result of the conversion of the Cheyenne Refinery to renewable diesel production, lower volumes on our product pipelines servicing HF Sinclair's Navajo refinery and Delek's Big Spring refinery, and recording certain tariffs and fees as interest income under sales-type lease accounting that were previously recorded as revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020, partially offset by higher revenues from our crude pipeline systems in Wyoming and Utah and our Woods Cross and El Dorado refinery processing units mainly due to higher recovery of natural gas costs. 
 
 Revenues from our refined product pipelines were 107.4 million, a decrease of 9.5 million, on shipments averaging 158.1 mbpd compared to 161.5 mbpd for the year ended December 31, 2020. The volume and revenue decreases were mainly due to lower volumes on pipelines servicing HFC's Navajo refinery and Delek's Big Spring refinery. 
 
 Revenues from our intermediate pipelines were 30.1 million, an increase of 0.1 million, on shipments averaging 125.2 mbpd compared to 137.1 mbpd for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in volumes was mainly due to lower throughputs on our intermediate pipelines servicing HF Sinclair's Tulsa and Navajo refineries while revenue remained relatively constant mainly due to contractual minimum volume guarantees. 
 
 Revenues from our crude pipelines were 125.6 million, an increase of 6.7 million, on shipments averaging 408.6 mbpd compared to 387.7 mbpd for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increases were mainly attributable to increased volumes on our crude pipeline systems in Wyoming and Utah partially offset by lower volumes on our pipeline systems servicing HF Sinclair's Navajo refinery. Volumes also increased due to the addition of volumes on our Cushing Connect Pipeline in Oklahoma which went into service at the end of the third quarter of 2021. 
 
 Revenues from terminal, tankage and loading rack fees were 142.3 million, a decrease of 9.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Refined products and crude oil terminalled in the facilities averaged 442.9 mbpd compared to 442.2 mbpd for the year ended December 31, 2020.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Overview 
 In April 2021, we amended our senior secured revolving credit facility (the Credit Agreement ), decreasing the size of the facility from 1.4 billion to 1.2 billion and extending the maturity date to July 27, 2025. In August 2022, the Credit Agreement was amended to, among other things, provide an alternative reference rate for LIBOR. The Credit Agreement is available to fund capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, distribution payments and working capital and for general partnership purposes. The Credit Agreement is also available to fund letters of credit up to a 50 million sub-limit and continues to provide for an accordion feature that allows us to increase commitments under the Credit Agreement up to a maximum amount of 1.7 billion. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we received advances totaling 510.0 million and repaid 682.0 million, resulting in a net decrease of 172.0 million under the Credit Agreement and an outstanding balance of 668.0 million at December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we had no letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement, and the available capacity under the Credit Agreement was 532.0 million. 
 On April 8, 2022, we closed a private placement of 400 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.375 senior unsecured notes due in 2027 (the 6.375 Senior Notes ). The 6.375 Senior Notes were issued at par for net proceeds of approximately 393 million, after deducting the initial purchasers discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. The total net proceeds from the offering of the 6.375 Senior Notes were used to partially repay outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, increasing our available liquidity. 
 - 62 - 

We have a continuous offering program under which we may issue and sell common units from time to time, representing limited partner interests, up to an aggregate gross sales amount of 200 million. No units were issued under the program during the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, HEP had issued 2,413,153 units under this program, providing 82.3 million in gross proceeds. 
 
 Under our registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC using a shelf registration process, we currently have the authority to raise up to 2.0 billion by offering securities, through one or more prospectus supplements that would describe, among other things, the specific amounts, prices and terms of any securities offered and how the proceeds would be used. Any proceeds from the sale of securities are expected to be used for general business purposes, which may include, among other things, funding acquisitions of assets or businesses, working capital, capital expenditures, investments in subsidiaries, the retirement of existing debt and/or the repurchase of common units or other securities. 
 
 We believe our current sources of liquidity, including cash balances, future internally generated funds, funds available under the Credit Agreement, as well as our access to additional bank financing, and public or private capital markets will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital liquidity, capital expenditure and quarterly distribution needs for the foreseeable future. Future securities issuances, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. 
 
 We remain committed to our capital allocation strategy focused on funding all capital expenditures and distributions within operating cash flow, with the goal of achieving our leverage target of 3.0 - 3.5x and distributable cash flow coverage of 1.3x or greater. We expect to reach our leverage target in mid-2023, and once that target is achieved, we plan to evaluate incremental cash return to unitholders. 
 
 In each of February, May, August and November 2022, we paid regular quarterly cash distributions of 0.3500 on all units for an aggregate amount of 170.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. In February 2023, we paid a regular quarterly cash distribution of 0.3500 on all units in an aggregate amount of 44.3 million. 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents decreased by 3.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2022.

 Capital Requirements 
 Our pipeline and terminalling operations are capital intensive, requiring investments to maintain, expand, upgrade or enhance existing operations and to meet environmental and operational regulations. Our capital requirements have consisted of, and are expected to continue to consist of, maintenance capital expenditures and expansion capital expenditures. Maintenance capital expenditures represent capital expenditures to replace partially or fully depreciated assets to maintain the operating capacity of existing assets. Maintenance capital expenditures include expenditures required to maintain equipment reliability, tankage and pipeline integrity, safety and to address environmental regulations. Expansion capital expenditures represent capital expenditures to expand the operating capacity of existing or new assets, but exclude acquisitions. Expansion capital expenditures include expenditures to grow our business and to expand existing facilities, such as projects that increase throughput capacity on our pipelines and in our terminals. Repair and maintenance expenses associated with existing assets that are minor in nature and do not extend the useful life of existing assets are charged to operating expenses as incurred. 
 
 Each year the board of directors of HLS, our ultimate general partner, approves our annual capital budget, which specifies capital projects that our management is authorized to undertake. Additionally, at times when conditions warrant or as new opportunities arise, additional projects may be approved. The funds allocated for a particular capital project may be expended over a period in excess of a year, depending on the time required to complete the project. Therefore, our planned capital expenditures for a given year consist of expenditures approved for capital projects included in the current year s capital budget as well as, in certain cases, expenditures approved for capital projects in capital budgets for prior years. Our current 2023 capital forecast is comprised of approximately 25 million to 35 million for maintenance capital expenditures and 5 to 10 million for expansion capital expenditures and joint venture investments. In addition to our capita l budget, we may spend funds periodically to perform capital upgrades or additions to our assets where a customer reimburses us for such costs. The upgrades or additions would generally benefit the customer over the remaining life of the related service agreements. 
 
 We expect that our currently planned sustaining and maintenance capital expenditures, as well as expenditures for capital development projects, will be funded with cash generated by operations. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets. 
 
 Under the terms of the transaction to acquire HFC s 75 interest in UNEV, we issued to a subsidiary of HFC (now HF Sinclair) a Class B unit comprising a noncontrolling equity interest in a wholly owned subsidiary subject to redemption to the extent that HFC (now HF Sinclair) is entitled to a 50 interest in 75 of annual UNEV earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization above 40 million beginning July 1, 2015, and ending in June 2032, subject to certain limitations. However, to the extent earnings thresholds are not achieved, no redemption payments are required. No redemption payments have been required to date.

Credit Agreement 
 In April 2021, we amended our Credit Agreement, decreasing the commitments under the facility from 1.4 billion to 1.2 billion and extending the maturity date to July 27, 2025. In August 2022, the Credit Agreement was amended to, among other things, provide an alternative reference rate for LIBOR. The Credit Agreement is available to fund capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, distribution payments and working capital and for general partnership purposes. The Credit Agreement is also available to fund letters of credit up to a 50 million sub-limit, and it continues to provide for an accordion feature that allows us to increase the commitments under the Credit Agreement up to a maximum amount of 1.7 billion. As of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding borrowings of 668.0 million under the Credit Agreement, no letters of credit outstanding, and the available capacity was 532.0 million. 
 
 Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets, and indebtedness under the Credit Agreement is guaranteed by our material wholly owned subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement requires us to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants consisting of total leverage, senior secured leverage and interest coverage. It also limits or restricts our ability to engage in certain activities. If, at any time prior to the expiration of the Credit Agreement, HEP obtains two investment grade credit ratings, the Credit Agreement will become unsecured and many of the covenants, limitations, and restrictions will be eliminated. 
 
 We may prepay all loans at any time without penalty, except for tranche breakage costs. If an event of default exists under the Credit Agreement, the lenders will be able to accelerate the maturity of all loans outstanding and exercise other rights and remedies. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Prior to the Investment Grade Date (as defined in the Credit Agreement), indebtedness under the Credit Agreement bears interest, at our option, at either (a) the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin (ranging from 0.75 to 1.75 or (b) Adjusted Term SOFR (net of our unrestricted cash and Liquid Investments (as defined in the Credit Agreement) at such time in an amount not to exceed 50.0 million) plus an applicable margin (ranging from 1.75 to 2.75 ). In each case, the applicable margin is based upon the ratio of our funded debt (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined in the Credit Agreement). The weighted-average interest rates on our Credit Agreement borrowings for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021, were 4.02 and 2.30 , respectively. Prior to the Investment Grade Date, we incur a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Credit Agreement at an annual rate ranging from 0.25 to 0.50 based upon the ratio of our funded debt (net of our unrestricted cash and Liquid Investments at such time in an amount not to exceed 50.0 million) to EBITDA for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters. 
 
 Senior Notes 
 On April 8, 2022, we closed a private placement of 400 million in aggregate principal amount of the 6.375 Senior Notes. The 6.375 Senior Notes were issued at par for net proceeds of approximately 393 million, after deducting the initial purchasers discounts and commissions and offering expenses. The total net proceeds from the offering of the 6.375 Senior Notes were used to partially repay outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, increasing our available liquidity. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 500 million in aggregate principal amount of 5 Senior Notes due in 2028 (the 5 Senior Notes, and together with the 6.375 Senior Notes, the Senior Notes ). 
 
 The Senior Notes are unsecured and impose certain restrictive covenants, including limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, sell assets, incur certain liens, pay distributions, enter into transactions with affiliates, and enter into mergers. We were in compliance with the restrictive covenants for the Senior Notes as of December 31, 2022. At any time when the Senior Notes are rated investment grade by either Moody s or Standard Poor s and no default or event of default exists, we will not be subject to many of the foregoing covenants. Additionally, we have certain redemption rights at varying premiums over face value under the Senior Notes. 
 
 Indebtedness under the Senior Notes is guaranteed by all of our existing wholly owned subsidiaries (other than Holly Energy Finance Corp. and certain immaterial subsidiaries).

Long-term Debt 
 The carrying amounts of our long-term debt are as follows: December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (In thousands) Credit Agreement Amount outstanding 668,000 840,000 5 Senior Notes Principal 500,000 500,000 Unamortized debt issuance costs (5,953) (6,951) 494,047 493,049 6.375 Senior Notes Principal 400,000 Unamortized debt issuance costs (5,713) 394,287 Total long-term debt 1,556,334 1,333,049 
 
 Long-term Contractual Obligations 
 The following table presents our long-term contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Over 5 Years (In thousands) Long-term debt principal 1,568,000 668,000 400,000 500,000 Long-term debt - interest 346,578 93,700 168,920 81,750 2,083 Site service fees 238,505 5,681 11,362 11,362 210,100 Pipeline finance lease 32,621 7,249 14,498 10,874 Right-of-way agreements and other 19,794 5,783 7,528 1,902 4,581 Total 2,205,498 112,413 870,308 505,888 716,764 
 Long-term debt consists of outstanding principal under the Credit Agreement and the Senior Notes. Interest on the Credit Agreement is calculated using the rate in effect at December 31, 2022. 
 Site service fees consist of site service agreements with HF Sinclair, expiring in 2058 through 2066, for the provision of certain facility services and utility costs that relate to our assets located at HF Sinclair s refinery facilities. We are presenting obligations for the full term of these agreements; however, the agreements can be terminated with 180 day notice if we cease to operate the applicable assets. 
 The pipeline finance lease amounts above reflect the exercise of the second 10-year extension, expiring in 2027, on our lease agreement for the refined products pipeline between White Lakes Junction and Kuntz Station in New Mexico. 
 Most of our right-of-way agreements are renewable on an annual basis, and the right-of-way agreements payments above include only obligations under the remaining non-cancelable terms of these agreements at December 31, 2022. For the foreseeable future, we intend to continue renewing these agreements and expect to incur right-of-way expenses in addition to the payments listed. 
 Other contractual obligations include capital lease obligations related to vehicles leases, office space leases, and other. 
 
 Impact of Inflation 
 After being relatively moderate in recent years, PPI in the United States increased significantly in 2022 and 2021 (13.5 and 8.9 , respectively). 
 
 The substantial majority of our revenues are generated under long-term contracts that provide for increases or decreases in our rates and minimum revenue guarantees annually for increases or decreases in the PPI. These annual rate adjustments generally occur on July 1st each year based on the PPI or FERC index increase or decrease during the prior year. Certain of these 
 - 66 - 

contracts have provisions that limit the level of annual PPI percentage rate increases or decreases, and the majority of our rates do not decrease when PPI is negative. The substantial majority of our rates and minimum revenue guarantees used the 2021 PPI increase of 8.9 in the July 1, 2022 rate adjustment calculations. 
 
 A significant and prolonged period of high inflation or a significant and prolonged period of negative inflation could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations if costs increase at a rate greater than the fees we charge our shippers. However, for the year ended December 31, 2022, the fees we charged our shippers increased at a rate greater than our inflationary cost increase. 
 
 Environmental Matters 
 Our operation of pipelines, terminals, and associated facilities in connection with the transportation and storage of refined products and crude oil is subject to stringent and complex federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. As with the industry generally, compliance with existing and anticipated laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to construct, maintain, and upgrade equipment and facilities. While these laws and regulations affect our maintenance capital expenditures and net income, we believe that they do not affect our competitive position given that the operations of our competitors are similarly affected. However, these laws and regulations, and the interpretation or enforcement thereof, are subject to frequent change by regulatory authorities, and we are unable to predict the ongoing cost to us of complying with these laws and regulations or the future impact of these laws and regulations on our operations. Violation of environmental laws, regulations, and permits can result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions, and construction bans or delays. A major discharge of hydrocarbons or hazardous substances into the environment could, to the extent the event is not insured, subject us to substantial expense, including both the cost to comply with applicable laws and regulations and claims made by employees, neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage. 
 Contamination resulting from spills of refined products and crude oil is not unusual within the petroleum pipeline industry. Historic spills along our existing pipelines and terminals as a result of past operations have resulted in contamination of the environment, including soils and groundwater. Some environmental laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original act on certain classes of persons that contributed to the releases of hazardous substances or petroleum hydrocarbon substances into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, the hazardous substances found at the site. Such persons may be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. Site conditions, including soils and groundwater, are being evaluated at a few of our properties where operations may have resulted in releases of hydrocarbons and other wastes. 
 There are environmental remediation projects in progress, including assessment and monitoring activities, that relate to certain assets acquired from HF Sinclair. Under the Omnibus Agreement and certain transportation agreements and purchase agreements with HF Sinclair, HF Sinclair has agreed to indemnify us, subject to certain monetary and time limitations, for environmental noncompliance and remediation liabilities associated with certain assets transferred to us from HF Sinclair and occurring or existing prior to the date of such transfers. 
 We have an environmental agreement with Delek with respect to pre-closing environmental costs and liabilities relating to the pipelines and terminals acquired from Delek in 2005, under which Delek will indemnify us subject to certain monetary and time limitations. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we have an accrual of 19.5 million that relates to environmental clean-up projects for which we have assumed liability, including accrued environmental liabilities assumed in the Sinclair Transportation acquisition that have preliminarily been fair valued at 14.7 million as of the acquisition date, or for which the indemnity provided for by HF Sinclair has expired. 
 On July 8, 2022, the Osage pipeline, which carries crude oil from Cushing, Oklahoma to El Dorado, Kansas, suffered a release of crude oil. Our equity in earnings (loss) of equity method investments was reduced in the year ended December 31, 2022 by 17.6 million for our 50 share of incurred and estimated environmental remediation and recovery expenses associated with the release, net of our share of insurance proceeds received to date of 3.0 million. We expect Osage will receive additional insurance recoveries, which will be recorded as they are received. If our insurance policy pays out in full, our share of the remaining insurance coverage is expected to be 9.5 million. The pipeline resumed operations in the third quarter of 2022 and remediation efforts are underway.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We consider the following policies to be the most critical to understanding the judgments that are involved and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Revenues are generally recognized as products are shipped through our pipelines and terminals, feedstocks are processed through our refinery processing units or other services are rendered. The majority of our contracts with customers meet the definition of a lease since (1) performance of the contracts is dependent on specified property, plant, or equipment and (2) the possibility is remote that one or more parties other than the customer will take more than a minor amount of the output associated with the specified property, plant, or equipment. Prior to the adoption of the new lease standard (see below), we bifurcated the consideration received between lease and service revenue. The new lease standard allows the election of a practical expedient whereby a lessor does not have to separate non-lease (service) components from lease components under certain conditions. The majority of our contracts meet these conditions, and we have made this election for those contracts. Under this practical expedient, we treat the combined components as a single performance obligation in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606, which largely codified ASU 2014-09, if the non-lease (service) component is the dominant component. If the lease component is the dominant component, we treat the combined components as a lease in accordance with ASC 842, which largely codified ASU 2016-02. 
 Several of our contracts include incentive or reduced tariffs once a certain quarterly volume is met. Revenue from the variable element of these transactions is recognized based on the actual volumes shipped as it relates specifically to rendering the services during the applicable quarter. 
 The majority of our long-term transportation contracts specify minimum volume requirements, whereby, we bill a customer for a minimum level of shipments in the event a customer ships below their contractual requirements. If there are no future performance obligations, we will recognize these deficiency payments in revenue. 
 In certain of these throughput agreements, a customer may later utilize such shortfall billings as credit towards future volume shipments in excess of its minimum levels within its respective contractual shortfall make-up period. Such amounts represent an obligation to perform future services, which may be initially deferred and later recognized as revenue based on estimated future shipping levels, including the likelihood of a customer s ability to utilize such amounts prior to the end of the contractual shortfall make-up period. We recognize these deficiency payments in revenue when we do not expect we will be required to satisfy these performance obligations in the future based on the pattern of rights projected to be exercised by the customer. 
 
 Leases 
 We adopted ASC 842 effective January 1, 2019, and elected to adopt using the modified retrospective transition method and practical expedients, both of which are provided as options by the standard and further defined below. 
 
 Lessee Accounting - At inception, we determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our payment obligation under the leasing arrangement. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use our estimated incremental borrowing rate IBR to determine the present value of lease payments as most of our leases do not contain an implicit rate. Our IBR represents the interest rate which we would pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis, an amount equal to the lease payments over a similar term in a similar economic environment. We use the implicit rate when readily determinable. 
 
 Operating leases are recorded in operating lease right-of-use assets and current and noncurrent operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Finance leases are included in properties and equipment, current finance lease liabilities and noncurrent finance lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 When renewal options are defined in a lease, our lease term includes an option to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain we will exercise that option. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on our balance sheet, and lease expense is accounted for on a straight-line basis. In addition, as a lessee, we separate non-lease components that are identifiable and exclude them from the determination of net present value of lease payment obligations. 
 - 68 - 

Lessor Accounting - Customer contracts that contain leases are generally classified as either operating leases, direct finance leases or sales-type leases. We consider inputs such as the lease term, fair value of the underlying asset and residual value of the underlying assets when assessing the classification. 
 
 Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets 
 Goodwill represents the excess of our cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the assets acquired, less liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized. We test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually and between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may exceed fair value. Our goodwill impairment testing first entails a comparison of our reporting unit fair values relative to their respective carrying values, including goodwill. If carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value for a reporting unit, we measure goodwill impairment as the excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. 
 
 Our annual goodwill impairment testing for 2022 and 2021 was performed on a qualitative basis during the third quarters of 2022 and 2021. We assessed qualitative factors such as macroeconomic conditions, cost factors and reporting unit financial performance and determined it was not more likely than not that fair value of our reporting units was less than the respective carrying value. Therefore, in accordance with GAAP, further testing was not required. 
 
 During the first quarter of 2021, changes in our agreements with HFC related to our Cheyenne assets resulted in an increase in the carrying amount of our Cheyenne reporting unit due to sales-type lease accounting, which led us to determine indicators of potential goodwill impairment for our Cheyenne reporting unit were present. 
 
 The estimated fair value of our Cheyenne reporting unit was derived using a combination of income and market approaches. The income approach reflects expected future cash flows based on anticipated gross margins, operating costs and capital expenditures. The market approaches include both the guideline public company and guideline transaction methods. Both methods utilize pricing multiples derived from historical market transactions of other like-kind assets. These fair value measurements involve significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). See Note 6 for further discussion of Level 3 inputs. 
 
 Our interim impairment testing of our Cheyenne reporting unit goodwill identified an impairment charge of 11.0 million, which was recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2021. 
 
 Our annual goodwill testing for 2020 was performed on a quantitative basis during the third quarter of 2020. The estimated fair value of our reporting units derived using a combination of both income and market approaches as described above. Our annual testing of goodwill in 2020 identified an impairment charge of 35.7 million, which was recorded in the third quarter of 2020, related to our Cheyenne reporting unit. 
 
 We evaluate long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, for potential impairment by identifying whether indicators of impairment exist and, if so, assessing whether the long-lived assets are recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows. The actual amount of impairment loss, if any, to be recorded is equal to the amount by which a long-lived asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value. 
 
 Valuation of Business Combinations 
 We recognize and measure the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. Any excess or surplus of the purchase consideration when compared to the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill or gain from a bargain purchase. The fair value of assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date are often estimated using a combination of approaches, including the income approach, which requires us to project future cash flows and apply an appropriate discount rate; the cost approach, which requires estimates of replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence estimates; and the market approach which uses market data and adjusts for entity-specific differences. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations and engage third-party consultants for valuation assistance. The estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from the projected results used to determine fair value. 
 
 Contingencies 
 We are subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to environmental, labor, product and other matters. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. 
 - 69 - 

RISK MANAGEMENT 
 
 The market risk inherent in our debt positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, we had an outstanding principal balance of 900.0 million on our Senior Notes. A change in interest rates generally would affect the fair value of the Senior Notes, but not our earnings or cash flows. At December 31, 2022, the fair value of our Senior Notes was 852.7 million. We estimate a hypothetical 10 change in the yield-to-maturity applicable to the Senior Notes at December 31, 2022, would result in a change of approximately 24.2 million in the fair value of the underlying Senior Notes. 
 
 For the variable rate Credit Agreement, changes in interest rates would affect cash flows, but not the fair value. At December 31, 2022, borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement were 668.0 million. A hypothetical 10 change in interest rates applicable to the Credit Agreement would not materially affect our cash flows. 
 
 At our election, certain borrowings under our variable rate Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable rate based on the secured overnight financing rate SOFR as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
 
 Our operations are subject to normal hazards of operations, including fire, explosion and weather-related perils. We maintain various insurance coverages, including business interruption insurance, subject to certain deductibles. We are not fully insured against certain risks because such risks are not fully insurable, coverage is unavailable, or premium costs, in our judgment, do not justify such expenditures. 
 
 We have a risk management oversight committee that is made up of members from our senior management. This committee monitors our risk environment and provides direction for activities to mitigate, to an acceptable level, identified risks that may adversely affect the achievement of our goals. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. See Risk Management under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of market risk exposures that we have with respect to our long-term debt. We utilize derivative instruments to hedge our interest rate exposure, as discussed under Risk Management. 
 Since we do not own products shipped on our pipelines or terminalled at our terminal facilities, we do not have direct market risks associated with commodity prices.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 
 MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE PARTNERSHIP S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 Management of Holly Energy Partners, L.P. (the Partnership is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 
 Management assessed the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, using the criteria for effective control over financial reporting established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Partnership maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. Management s assessment of, and conclusion on, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the HEP Acquired Sinclair Businesses, that were acquired on March 14, 2022, as we are in the process of integrating operations of the HEP Acquired Sinclair Businesses, including internal controls over financial reporting. The HEP Acquired Sinclair Businesses accounted for approximately 26 of the Partnership's consolidated total assets and 5 of consolidated total revenues of the Partnership as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 The Partnership s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. That report appears on page 72.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Unitholders of Holly Energy Partners, L.P. and the Board of Directors of Holly Logistic Services, L.L.C. 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited Holly Energy Partners, L.P. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Holly Energy Partners, L.P. (the Partnership) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. 
 As indicated in the accompanying Management s Report on its Assessment of the Partnership s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the HEP Acquired Sinclair Businesses, which is included in the 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Partnership and constituted approximately 26 of consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2022 and 5 of consolidated total revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the HEP Acquired Sinclair Businesses. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Partnership as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes of the Partnership, and our report dated February 28, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Partnership s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on its Assessment of the Partnership s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To Unitholders of Holly Energy Partners, L.P. and the Board of Directors of Holly Logistic Services, L.L.C. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Holly Energy Partners, L.P. (the Partnership) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Partnership at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 28, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Partnership s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Sales-Type Lease Accounting Description of the Matter As disclosed in Note 5 of the financial statements, the Partnership entered into new agreements and amended other agreements which met the criteria of sales-type leases. Under sales-type lease accounting, the lessor recognizes a net investment in the lease and derecognizes the underlying asset with any difference recorded as a gain or loss at the lease commencement date. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Partnership recorded total net investment in leases of 234.7 million. 
 
 Auditing management s accounting for sales-type leases was complex and highly judgmental due to the estimation uncertainty in determining the fair value of the underlying leased assets at the commencement date of the leases. The fair value of the underlying leased assets is factored into the Partnership s determination of the net investment in the leases. The fair value estimates for these assets were sensitive to significant assumptions including replacement cost as adjusted for physical deterioration. These assumptions have a significant effect on the fair value estimates of the assets acquired.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Partnership's evaluation of the lease classification and related accounting for the sales-type leases. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the significant inputs and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the underlying leased assets. 
 
 To test the Partnership s accounting for the sales-type leases, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the Partnership s selection of the valuation methodology, evaluating the significant assumptions used by the Partnership, and evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions and estimates. We involved valuation specialists to assist with our evaluation of the methodologies used by the Partnership and significant assumptions included in the fair value estimates. Specifically, our valuation specialists assisted by comparing those assumptions to current industry and market data and developing an expected range of values based on significant inputs and assumptions to assess reasonableness of the Partnership s estimates. 
 Valuation of Personal Property Assets in the Sinclair Transportation Company Acquisition Description of the Matter During 2022, the Partnership completed its acquisition of Sinclair Transportation Company for an aggregate 678.0 million in cash and common limited partner units, as disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination. Of the total assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Partnership acquired 340.7 million of properties, plant, and equipment, which was made up of real and personal property. 
 
 Auditing management's accounting for the acquisition of Sinclair Transportation Company was complex due to the significant estimation uncertainty in determining the fair value of certain properties, plant and equipment. In particular, the fair value estimates for Sinclair Transportation Company personal property were sensitive to significant assumptions including replacement cost as adjusted for physical deterioration. These assumptions have a significant effect on the fair value estimates of the assets acquired. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Partnership's controls over the valuation of the personal property assets related to the acquisition. For example, we tested controls over management s review of the valuation models and the underlying assumptions used to develop estimated values of these assets. 
 
 To test the estimated fair value of the personal property, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the Partnership s selection of the valuation methodology, evaluating the significant assumptions used by the Partnership, and evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions and estimates.

 In connection with the closing of the HFC Transactions, HF Sinclair issued shares of HF Sinclair common stock to REH Company, representing of the pro forma equity of HF Sinclair with a value of approximately million based on HFC s fully diluted shares of common stock outstanding and closing stock price on March 11, 2022. References herein to HF Sinclair with respect to time periods prior to March 14, 2022 refer to HFC and its consolidated subsidiaries and do not include the Target Company, Sinclair Transportation or their respective consolidated subsidiaries. References herein to HF Sinclair with respect to time periods from and after March 14, 2022 refer to HF Sinclair and its consolidated subsidiaries, which includes the combined business operations of HFC, the Target Company, Sinclair Transportation and their respective consolidated subsidiaries. 
 
 Additionally, on the Closing Date, pursuant to that certain Contribution Agreement, dated August 2, 2021 (as amended on March 14, 2022, the Contribution Agreement by and among REH Company, Sinclair Transportation and HEP, HEP acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Sinclair Transportation from REH Company in exchange for million newly issued common limited partner units of HEP (the HEP Units ), representing of the pro forma outstanding HEP Units with a value of approximately million based on HEP s fully diluted common limited partner units outstanding and closing unit price on March 11, 2022, and cash consideration equal to million, inclusive of final working capital adjustments pursuant to the Contribution Agreement for an aggregate transaction value of million (the HEP Transaction and together with the HFC Transactions, the Sinclair Transactions ). Of the million HEP Units, million units are currently held in escrow to secure REH Company s renewable identification numbers RINs credit obligations to HF Sinclair under Section 6.22 of the Business Combination Agreement. HF Sinclair, and not HEP, would be entitled to the HEP common units held in escrow in the event of REH Company s breach of its RINs credit obligations under the Business Combination Agreement. The cash consideration was funded through a draw under HEP s senior secured revolving credit facility. The HEP Transaction was conditioned on the closing of the HFC Transactions, which occurred immediately following the HEP Transaction.

Following the HEP Transaction (see Note 2), we now own the remaining interest in UNEV Pipeline, LLC and as a result, UNEV Pipeline, LLC is our wholly owned subsidiary. 
 
 On June 1, 2020, HFC announced plans to permanently cease petroleum refining operations at its Cheyenne refinery (the Cheyenne Refinery and to convert certain assets at that refinery to renewable diesel production. HFC subsequently began winding down petroleum refining operations at the Cheyenne Refinery on August 3, 2020. 
 
 On February 8, 2021, HEP and HFC finalized and executed new agreements for HEP s Cheyenne assets with the following terms, in each case effective January 1, 2021: (1) a lease with renewal option periods for HFC s (and now HF Sinclair's) use of certain HEP tank and rack assets in the Cheyenne Refinery to facilitate renewable diesel production with an annual lease payment of approximately million, (2) a contango service fee arrangement that will utilize HEP tank assets inside the Cheyenne Refinery where HFC (and now HF Sinclair) will pay a base tariff to HEP for available crude oil storage and HFC (and now HF Sinclair) and HEP will split any profits generated on crude oil contango opportunities and (3) HFC paid a million one-time cash payment from HFC to HEP for the termination of the existing minimum volume commitment. 
 
 On April 1, 2021, we sold our 156-mile, 6-inch refined product pipeline that connected HF Sinclair s Navajo refinery to terminals in El Paso for gross proceeds of million and recognized a gain on sale of million. 
 
 We operate in reportable segments, a Pipelines and Terminals segment and a Refinery Processing Unit segment. Disclosures around these segments are discussed in Note 16. 
 
 We generate revenues by charging tariffs for transporting petroleum products and crude oil through our pipelines, by charging fees for terminalling and storing refined products and other hydrocarbons, providing other services at our storage tanks and terminals and by charging fees for processing hydrocarbon feedstocks through our refinery processing units. We do not take ownership of products that we transport, terminal, store or process, and therefore, we are not exposed directly to changes in commodity prices.

 Our annual impairment testing for 2020 was performed on a quantitative basis during the third quarter of 2020. The estimated fair value of our reporting units were derived using a combination of both income and market approaches as described above. Our annual testing of goodwill in 2020 identified an impairment charge of million, which was recorded in the third quarter of 2020, related to our Cheyenne reporting unit.

Accumulated impairment losses ) ) 
 
 We evaluate long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, for potential impairment by identifying whether indicators of impairment exist and, if so, assessing whether the long-lived assets are recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows. The actual amount of impairment loss, if any, to be recorded is equal to the amount by which a long-lived asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value.

 interest in UNEV, we issued to a subsidiary of HFC (now HF Sinclair) a Class B unit comprising a noncontrolling equity interest in a wholly owned subsidiary subject to redemption to the extent that HFC (now HF Sinclair) is entitled to a interest in of annual UNEV earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization above million beginning July 1, 2015, and ending in June 2032, subject to certain limitations. However, to the extent earnings thresholds are not achieved, no redemption payments are required. No redemption payments have been required to date. 
 
 Pursuant to the terms of the transaction agreements, the Class B unit increases by the amount of each foregone incentive distribution and by a factor compounded annually on the outstanding unredeemed balance through its expiration date. At our option, we may redeem, in whole or in part, the Class B unit at the current unredeemed value based on the calculation described. The Class B unit had a carrying value of million at December 31, 2022, and million at December 31, 2021.

Lessee Accounting - At inception, we determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our payment obligation under the leasing arrangement. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use our estimated incremental borrowing rate IBR to determine the present value of lease payments as most of our leases do not contain an implicit rate. Our IBR represents the interest rate which we would pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis, an amount equal to the lease payments over a similar term in a similar economic environment. We use the implicit rate when readily determinable. 
 
 Operating leases are recorded in operating lease right-of-use assets and current and noncurrent operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Finance leases are included in properties and equipment, current finance lease liabilities and noncurrent finance lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 When renewal options are defined in a lease, our lease term includes an option to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain we will exercise that option. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on our balance sheet, and lease expense is accounted for on a straight-line basis. In addition, as a lessee, we separate non-lease components that are identifiable and exclude them from the determination of net present value of lease payment obligations.

On the same date and immediately following the consummation of the HEP Transaction, pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, REH Company contributed all of the equity interests of the Target Company to HF Sinclair in exchange for shares of common stock in HF Sinclair, representing of the pro forma equity of HF Sinclair with a value of approximately million based on HF Sinclair s fully diluted shares of common stock outstanding and closing stock price on March 11, 2022. 
 
 On August 2, 2021, in connection with the Contribution Agreement, HEP, Holly Logistics Services, L.L.C., the ultimate general partner of HEP HLS and Navajo Pipeline Co., L.P., the sole member of HLS (the Sole Member ), entered into a unitholders agreement (the Unitholders Agreement by and among HEP, HLS, the Sole Member, REH Company and the stockholders of REH Company (each a Unitholder and collectively, the Unitholders, and along with REH Company and each of their permitted transferees, the REH Parties ), which became effective on the Closing Date. 
 
 Pursuant to the Unitholders Agreement, the REH Parties have the right to nominate, and have nominated, person to the board of directors of HLS until such time that (x) the REH Parties beneficially own less than million HEP Units or (y) the HEP Units beneficially owned by the REH Parties constitute less than of all outstanding HEP Units. The Unitholders Agreement also subjects million of the HEP Units issued to the REH Parties (the Restricted Units to a lock-up period commencing on the Closing Date, during which the REH Parties are prohibited from selling the Restricted Units, except for certain permitted transfers. One-third of such Restricted Units were released from such restrictions on the date that was six months after the closing, one-third of the Restricted Units will be released from such restrictions on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, and the remainder will be released from such restrictions on the date that is 15 months from the Closing Date. 
 
 Under the terms of the Contribution Agreement, HEP acquired Sinclair Transportation, which together with its subsidiaries, owned REH Company s integrated crude and refined products pipelines and terminal assets, including approximately miles of integrated crude and refined product pipelines supporting the REH Company refineries and other third-party refineries, product terminals and crude terminals with approximately million barrels of operated storage. In addition, HEP acquired Sinclair Transportation s interests in three pipeline joint ventures for crude gathering and product offtake including: Saddle Butte Pipeline III, LLC non-operated interest); Pioneer Pipeline non-operated interest); and UNEV Pipeline (the non-operated interest not already owned by HEP, resulting in UNEV Pipeline, LLC becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of HEP). 
 
 The HEP Transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting, with the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective acquisition date fair values at the Closing Date, with the ex cess consideration recorded as goodwill. The preliminary purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of million in goodwill.

 The fair value of properties, plants and equipment was based on the combination of the cost and market approaches. Key assumptions in the cost approach include determining the replacement cost by evaluating recently published data and adjusting replacement cost for physical deterioration, functional and economic obsolescence. We used the market approach to measure the value of certain assets through an analysis of recent sales or offerings of comparable properties. 
 
 The fair value of the equity method investments were based on a combination of valuation methods including discounted cash flows and the guideline public company method. 
 
 The fair values discussed above were based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and, therefore, represent Level 3 measurements. See Note 6. 
 
 The fair values of all other current receivable and payables were equivalent to their carrying values due to their short-term nature. 
 
 These fair value estimates are preliminary and, therefore, the final fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the resulting effect on our financial position may change once all needed information has become available, and we finalize our valuations. 
 
 Our consolidated financial and operating results for the year ended December 31, 2022 reflected the Sinclair Transportation operations beginning March 14, 2022. Our results of operations included revenue, interest income from sales-type leases and net income of million, million and million, respectively, for the period from March 14, 2022 through December 31, 2022, related to these operations. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, we incur red million in in cremental direct acquisition and integration costs that principally relate to legal, advisory and other professional fees and are presented as general and administrative expenses in our statements of operations. 
 
 The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial data for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was derived from our historical financial statements giving effect to the HEP Transaction as if it had occurred on January 1, 2021. The below information reflects pro forma adjustments based on available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable, including the depreciation of Sinclair Transportation s fair-valued properties, plants and equipment.

 Contemporaneous with the closing of the Sinclair Transactions, HEP and HFC amended certain intercompany agreements, including the master throughput agreement, to include within the scope of such agreements certain of the assets acquired by HEP pursuant to the Contribution Agreement.

 barrel per day common carrier crude oil pipeline (the Cushing Connect Pipeline that connected the Cushing, Oklahoma crude oil hub to the Tulsa, Oklahoma refining complex owned by a subsidiary of HF Sinclair, and (ii) the ownership and operation of million barrels of crude oil storage in Cushing, Oklahoma (the Cushing Connect JV Terminal ). The Cushing Connect JV Terminal went in service during the second quarter of 2020, and the Cushing Connect Pipeline was placed into service during the third quarter of 2021. Long-term commercial agreements were entered into to support the Cushing Connect Joint Venture assets. 
 
 The Cushing Connect Joint Venture contracted with an affiliate of HEP to manage the construction and operation of the Cushing Connect Pipeline and with an affiliate of Plains to manage the operation of the Cushing Connect JV Terminal. The total Cushing Connect Joint Venture investment was generally shared equally among the partners. However, we were solely responsible for any Cushing Connect Pipeline construction costs that exceeded the budget by more than . HEP's share of the cost of the Cushing Connect JV Terminal contributed by Plains and Cushing Connect Pipeline construction costs was approximately million, including approximately million of Cushing Connect Pipeline construction costs that exceeded the budget by more than 10 borne solely by HEP. 
 
 The Cushing Connect Joint Venture legal entities are variable interest entities VIEs as defined under GAAP. A VIE is a legal entity if it has any one of the following characteristics: (i) the entity does not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support; (ii) the at risk equity holders, as a group, lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest; or (iii) the entity is structured with non-substantive voting rights. The Cushing Connect Joint Venture legal entities did not have sufficient equity at risk to finance their activities without additional financial support. Since HEP constructed and is operating the Cushing Connect Pipeline, HEP has more ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the financial performance of the Cushing Connect Joint Venture and Cushing Connect Pipeline legal entities. Therefore, HEP consolidates those legal entities. We do not have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Cushing Connect JV Terminal legal entity, and therefore, we account for our interest in the Cushing Connect JV Terminal legal entity using the equity method of accounting. HEP's maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the Cushing Connect JV Terminal legal entity is not expected to be material due to the long-term terminalling agreements in place to support its operations. 
 
 With the exception of the assets of HEP Cushing, creditors of the Cushing Connect Joint Venture legal entities have no recourse to our assets. Any recourse to HEP Cushing would be limited to the extent of HEP Cushing's assets, which other than its investment in Cushing Connect Joint Venture, are not significant. Furthermore, our creditors have no recourse to the assets of the Cushing Connect Joint Venture legal entities.

Service revenues 
 A contract liability exists when an entity is obligated to perform future services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration. Since HEP may be required to perform future services for deficiency payments received, the deferred revenues on our balance sheets were considered contract liabilities. A contract asset exists when an entity has a right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to a customer. 
 Contract liabilities ) 
 
 The contract assets and liabilities include both lease and service components. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized million and million, respectively, of revenue that was previously included in contract liability as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively . During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we also recognized million and million, respectively, of revenue included in contract assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we expect to recognize billion in revenue related to our unfulfilled performance obligations under the terms of our long-term throughput agreements and operating leases expiring in 2023 through 2037. These agreements provide for changes in the minimum revenue guarantees annually for increases or decreases in the Producer Price Index PPI or Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC index, with certain contracts having provisions that limit the level of the rate increases or decreases.

 Lessor Accounting 
 As discussed in Note 1, the majority of our contracts with customers meet the definition of a lease. See Note 1 for further discussion of the impact of adoption of this standard on our activities as a lessor. 
 
 Substantially all of the assets supporting contracts meeting the definition of a lease have long useful lives, and we believe these assets will continue to have value when the current agreements expire due to our risk management strategy for protecting the residual fair value of the underlying assets by performing ongoing maintenance during the lease term. HF Sinclair, generally has the option to purchase assets located within HF Sinclair, refinery boundaries, including refinery tankage, truck racks and refinery processing units, at fair market value when the related agreements expire. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we entered into new agreements, and amended other agreements, with HF Sinclair, related to our newly acquired Sinclair Transportation assets. Certain of these agreements met the criteria of sales-type leases. Under sales-type lease accounting, at the commencement date, the lessor recognizes a net investment in the lease, based on the estimated fair value of the underlying leased assets at contract inception, and derecognizes the underlying assets with the difference recorded as selling profit or loss arising from the lease. Because we recorded these assets at fair values under purchase price accounting, there was no gain or loss on these sales-type leases during the year ended December 31, 2022.

 For our sales-type leases, we included customer obligations related to minimum volume requirements in guaranteed minimum lease payments. Portions of our minimum guaranteed pipeline tariffs for assets subject to sales-type lease accounting are recorded as interest income with the remaining amounts recorded as a reduction in net investment in leases. We recognized any billings for throughput volumes in excess of minimum volume requirements as variable lease payments, and these variable lease payments were recorded in lease revenues.

 Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and debt. The carrying amounts of cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.

 We have a Long-Term Incentive Plan for employees and non-employee directors who perform services for us. The Long-Term Incentive Plan consists of components: restricted or phantom units, performance units, unit options, unit appreciation rights and cash awards. Our accounting policy for the recognition of compensation expense for awards with pro-rata vesting (a significant proportion of our awards) is to expense the costs ratably over the vesting periods. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we have types of unit-based awards outstanding, which are described below. The compensation cost charged against income was million, million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We currently purchase units in the open market instead of issuing new units for settlement of all unit awards under our Long-Term Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2022, units were authorized to be granted under our Long-Term Incentive Plan, of which have not yet been granted, assuming no forfeitures of the unvested units and full achievement of goals for the unvested performance units. 
 
 Phantom Units 
 Under our Long-Term Incentive Plan, we grant phantom units to non-employee directors and selected employees who perform services for us, with most awards vesting over a period of one to . Although full ownership of the units does not transfer to the recipients until the units vest, the recipients have distribution rights on these units from the date of grant. 
 
 The fair value of each phantom unit award is measured at the market price as of the date of grant and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award.

As of December 31, 2022, there was million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested phantom unit grants, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the grant date price applied to the number of restricted or phantom units awarded was and , respectively. 
 
 Performance Units 
 Under our Long-Term Incentive Plan, we grant performance units to selected executives who perform services for us. Performance units granted are payable in common units at the end of a performance period based upon meeting certain criteria over the performance period. Under the terms of our performance unit grants, some awards are subject to the growth in our distributable cash flow per common unit over the performance period while other awards are subject to financial performance and market performance. Financial performance is based on meeting certain earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA targets, while market performance is based on the relative standing of total unitholder return achieved by HEP compared to peer group companies. The number of units ultimately issued under these awards can range from to . 
 
 Although common units are not transferred to the recipients until the performance units vest, the recipients have distribution rights with respect to the target number of performance units subject to the award from the date of grant at the same rate as distributions paid on our common units.

 billion to billion and extending the maturity date to July 27, 2025. In August 2022, the Credit Agreement was amended to, among other things, provide an alternative reference rate for LIBOR. The Credit Agreement is available to fund capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, distribution payments, working capital and for general partnership purposes. The Credit Agreement is also available to fund letters of credit up to a million sub-limit and continues to provide for an accordion feature that allows us to increase commitments under the Credit Agreement up to a maximum amount of billion. 
 
 Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets, and indebtedness under the Credit Agreement is guaranteed by our material, wholly owned subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement requires us to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants consisting of total leverage, senior secured leverage, and interest coverage. It also limits or restricts our ability to engage in certain activities. If, at any time prior to the expiration of the Credit Agreement, HEP obtains two investment grade credit ratings, the Credit Agreement will become unsecured and many of the covenants, limitations, and restrictions will be eliminated. 
 
 We may prepay all loans at any time without penalty, except for tranche breakage costs. If an event of default exists under the Credit Agreement, the lenders will be able to accelerate the maturity of all loans outstanding and exercise other rights and remedies. We were in compliance with the covenants as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Senior Notes 
 On April 8, 2022, we closed a private placement of million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due in 2027 (the Senior Notes ). The Senior Notes were issued at par for net proceeds of approximately million, after deducting the initial purchasers discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. The total net proceeds from the offering of the Senior Notes were used to partially repay outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, increasing our available liquidity. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due in 2028 (the Senior Notes, and together with the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes ). 
 
 The Senior Notes are unsecured and impose certain restrictive covenants, including limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, sell assets, incur certain liens, pay distributions, enter into transactions with affiliates, and enter into mergers. At any time when the Senior Notes are rated investment grade by either Moody s or Standard Poor s and no default or event of default exists, we will not be subject to many of the foregoing covenants. Additionally, we have certain redemption rights at varying premiums over face value under the Senior Notes. 
 
 Indebtedness under the Senior Notes is guaranteed by all of our existing wholly owned subsidiaries (other than Holly Energy Finance Corp. and certain immaterial subsidiaries).

 Board Leadership Structure 
 
 The Board is responsible for selecting the Board leadership structure that is in the best interest of HLS and HEP. Currently, Mr. Jennings serves as Chairperson of the Board and as the Chief Executive Officer and President of HLS. Independent directors and management have different perspectives and roles in strategy development. The independent directors on the Board bring experience, oversight and expertise from outside HLS, HEP and the industry, while the Chief Executive Officer brings HLS and HEP experience and expertise. The Board believes the combined role of Chairperson of the Board and Chief Executive Officer working with the lead independent director (the Presiding Director ), is in the best interest of unitholders at this time because the combined role for HLS provides balance between strategy development and independent oversight of management, both of which are particularly useful in HLS s role as general partner.

 designating and calling meetings of the Board;

 facilitating teamwork and communication between the Board and management; and 
 
 acting as a liaison between management and the Board.

Baldwin, Presiding Director, c/o Secretary, Holly Logistic Services, L.L.C., 2828 N. Harwood, Suite 1300, Dallas, Texas 75201-1507.

 Risk Management 
 
 The Board has an active role in overseeing management of the risks affecting HLS and HEP. The Board regularly reviews information regarding HLS and HEP s credit, liquidity, business, operations and cybersecurity, as well as the risks associated with each. The Board committees are also engaged in overseeing risk associated with HLS and HEP. 
 
 The Compensation Committee oversees the management of risks relating to HLS s compensation plans and arrangements. 
 
 The Audit Committee oversees management of financial reporting and controls risks. 
 
 - 116 - 

A 

 The Conflicts Committee oversees specific matters that it or the Board believes may involve conflicts of interest with HF Sinclair. 
 
 While each committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of such risks, the entire Board is ultimately responsible for the risk management of HLS and HEP and is regularly informed on these matters through committee and senior management presentations. 
 
 The sole member of HLS manages risks associated with the independence of the Board. The Board also receives input and reports from HLS s risk management oversight committee on management s views of the risks facing HLS and HEP. The risk management oversight committee is made up of management personnel, none of whom serve on the Board and all of whom have a range of different backgrounds, skills and experiences with regard to the operational, financial and strategic risk profile of HLS and HEP. The risk management oversight committee supports the efforts of the Board and the Board committees to monitor and evaluate guidelines and policies governing HLS s and HEP s risk assessment and management. 
 
 Director Qualifications 
 
 The Board believes that it is necessary for each of HLS s directors to possess a range of relevant skills, expertise, knowledge and diversity of opinion. When searching for new candidates, the sole member of HLS considers the evolving needs of the Board and searches for candidates that fill any current or anticipated future needs. The Board also believes that all directors must possess a considerable amount of business management, business leadership and educational experience. In evaluating the suitability of individual director candidates, the sole member of HLS first considers a candidate s management experience and then considers issues of judgment, background, stature, conflicts of interest, integrity, ethics, industry knowledge, ability to commit adequate time to the Board, and commitment to the goal of maximizing unitholder value. The sole member of HLS also considers diversity of race, gender expression and identity, age, sexual orientation, ethnicity, knowledge, experience, viewpoints, geography, and other demographics. In considering candidates for the Board, the sole member of HLS considers the entirety of each candidate s credentials in the context of these standards. All our directors bring to the Board executive leadership experience derived from their service in many areas. 
 
 Pursuant to the Governance Guidelines of HLS and HEP, a director must submit his or her resignation to the Board on the date on which the director will attain the age of 75 or greater. If the resignation is accepted by the Board, the resignation will be effective no later than 12 months from when it was submitted. 
 
 Director Independence 
 
 The Board has determined that Larry R. Baldwin, Christine B. LaFollette, James H. Lee and Eric L. Mattson meet the applicable criteria for independence under the currently applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange NYSE ). Mr. Jennings is not independent because he is an officer of HLS and an employee of HF Sinclair. Mr. Petersen is not independent because he provided certain consulting services to HF Sinclair in 2022 pursuant to a consulting agreement he entered into with HF Sinclair on the closing of the Sinclair Transactions and received compensation for his services in the aggregate amount of 120,000. Mr. Petersen s consulting agreement expired in October 2022 according to its terms and was approved by the Audit Committee as a related party transaction under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. 
 
 Audit Committee. The Audit Committee of HLS is currently composed of three directors, Messrs. Baldwin, Lee and Mattson. The Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee is independent as defined by the NYSE listing standards and Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). 
 Conflicts Committee. The Conflicts Committee of HLS is currently composed of three directors, Messrs. Baldwin and Mattson and Ms. LaFollette. The Board has determined that each member of the Conflicts Committee is independent as defined by the NYSE listing standards and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act, as required by the Conflicts Committee Charter. 
 
 Compensation Committee . The Compensation Committee of HLS is currently composed of four directors, Messrs. Jennings, Lee and Petersen and Ms. LaFollette. The Board has determined that Mr. Lee and Ms. LaFollette are independent as defined by the NYSE listing standards. Because we are a master limited partnership, Rule 303A.05 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, which requires a publicly traded company to have a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors, does not apply to us.

A 

 Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
 
 HLS has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the Code that applies to all of its officers, directors and employees, including HLS s principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer. The purpose of the Code is to, among other things, affirm HLS s and HEP s commitment to a high standard of integrity and ethics. The Code sets forth a common set of values and standards to which all of HLS s officers, directors and employees must adhere. We will post information regarding an amendment to, or a waiver from, the Code on our website.

Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Long-Term Incentive Plan in the form of phantom units, with the number of awards calculated as described above.

Participating directors have full discretion over how their contributions to the NQDC Plan are invested among the investment options. Earnings on amounts contributed to the NQDC Plan are calculated in the same manner and at the same rate as earnings on actual investments.

 Unit Ownership and Retention Policy for Directors 
 
 Our directors, other than those who serve as officers of HLS, are subject to the HEP unit ownership and retention policy. Pursuant to the policy, each director is required to hold during service on the Board common units equal in value to at least three times the annual equity retainer paid to non-employee directors. Each subject director is required to meet the applicable requirements within five years of first being subject to the policy. 
 
 Directors are also required to continuously own sufficient units to meet the unit ownership and retention requirements once attained. Until directors meet the requirements, they will be required to hold 25 of the units received from any equity award. If a director attains compliance with the policy and subsequently falls below the requirement because of a decrease in the price of our common units, the director will be deemed in compliance provided that the director retains the units then held. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, all of our then-current directors were in compliance with the unit ownership and retention policy. 
 
 Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policy 
 
 All of our directors are subject to our Insider Trading Policy, which, among other things, prohibits directors from entering into short sales or hedging or pledging our common units and HF Sinclair common stock. The anti-hedging policy contained in our Insider Trading Policy specifically prohibits directors and their designees from purchasing financial instruments or otherwise engaging in transactions that hedge or offset or are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of HEP or HF Sinclair securities (or derivatives thereof), including through, among other mechanisms, the purchase of financial instruments (such as prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds) or other transactions that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of our securities. Additionally, all employees, including our named executive officers, are prohibited from holding our securities in a margin account or otherwise pledging our securities as collateral for a loan.

 Because the 2023 Director Awards were granted during 2022, they are reported in the "Unit Awards" column of the Director Compensation Table for 2022 rather than 2023 in accordance with SEC rules. The annual phantom unit awards for the 2022 fiscal year were granted on October 27, 2021 and were reported in the "Unit Awards" column of the Director Compensation Table for 2021 rather than 2022 in accordance with SEC rules. 
 
 The 2023 Director Awards vest on December 1, 2023, subject to continued service on the Board. As of December 31, 2022, these are the only phantom units held by our non-employee directors. For additional information regarding the annual phantom unit grants, please refer to the "Director Compensation" narrative above. 
 
 (3) Mr. Petersen was appointed to the HLS Board on March 15, 2022. He received a pro-rated cash retainer for the portion of the 2022 fiscal year that he served as a non-employee director of HLS, all of which he elected to defer pursuant to the NQDC Plan described above under "NonQualified Deferred Compensation Plan." There are no earnings reported for Mr. Petersen for any portion of the 2022 year with respect to the NQDC Plan, as no earnings are deemed to be above-market or preferential for that plan. Subsequent to Mr. Petersen's appointment, on April 27, 2022, he received a pro-rated equity award of 4,313 phantom units that vested on December 1, 2022 to compensate him for the portion of the 2022 fiscal year that he served as a non-employee director of HLS (the "Pro-rated 2022 Director Award"). On October 25, 2022, Mr. Petersen also received a 2023 Director Award for the 2023 fiscal year. Therefore, the amount reported for Mr. Petersen in the "Unit Awards" column in the table above reflects the aggregate grant date fair value of this Pro-rated 2022 Director Award and his 2023 Director Award, each computed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 ("FASB ASC Topic 718"), determined without regard to forfeitures. 

Item 11. Executive Compensation 
 
 Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
 
 This Compensation Discussion and Analysis provides information about our compensation objectives and policies for the HLS executive officers who are our Named Executive Officers for 2022 to the extent the Compensation Committee and the Board, or our Chief Executive Officer determines the compensation of these individuals and about the compensation for our other Named Executive Officers that is allocated to us pursuant to Compensation Committee action or SEC rules. In addition, the Compensation Discussion and Analysis is intended to place in perspective the information contained in the executive compensation tables that follow this discussion and provide a description of our policies relating to reimbursement to HF Sinclair and HLS for compensation expenses. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We are managed by HLS, the general partner of HEP Logistics, our general partner. HLS is a subsidiary of HF Sinclair. The employees providing services to us are either provided by HLS, which utilizes people employed by HF Sinclair to perform services for us, or seconded to us by subsidiaries of HF Sinclair, as we do not have any employees. 
 
 For 2022, our Named Executive Officers were: 
 
 Name Position with HLS in 2022 Michael C. Jennings Chief Executive Officer and President John Harrison Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Vaishali S. Bhatia Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary Mark T. Cunningham (1) 
 Former Senior Vice President, Operations and Engineering Richard L. Voliva III (2) 
 Former President 

(1) Mr. Cunningham retired as Senior Vice President, Operations and Engineering of HLS effective February 18, 2022 (referred to herein as his Retirement ). See the section below titled Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control - Retirement Consulting Arrangements with Mr. Cunningham for additional information regarding his 
 - 126 - 

A 

 Retirement. Although he was no longer employed at the end of the 2022 year, he is still deemed to be a Named Executive Officer pursuant to SEC disclosure rules. 
 
 (2) HLS and Richard L. Voliva III, President of HLS, agreed to a mutual separation effective September 15, 2022. As a result of Mr. Voliva's separation, the Board appointed Michael C. Jennings as President of HLS, effective as of September 15, 2022. See the section below titled "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control - Mutual Separation Agreement with Mr. Voliva" for additional information regarding his separation. Although he was no longer employed at the end of the 2022 year, he is still deemed to be a Named Executive Officer pursuant to SEC disclosure rules. 

During the period of their employment during 2022, certain of our Named Executive Officers were also officers of HF Sinclair or provided services to HF Sinclair. During 2022: 
 
 Prior to his Retirement, Mr. Cunningham spent all of his professional time managing our business and affairs and did not provide any services to HF Sinclair. 
 Messrs. Jennings and Harrison and Ms. Bhatia, and prior to his separation, Mr. Voliva, who we generally refer to as the HF Sinclair Shared Officers, also served as executive officers of HF Sinclair and devoted as much of their professional time as was necessary to oversee the management of our business and affairs. All compensation paid to such executive officers by HF Sinclair is paid and determined by HF Sinclair, without input from the Compensation Committee. For 2022, Mr. Voliva was the only HF Sinclair Shared Officer that received direct compensation from us as discussed below. 
 
 As noted above, Mr. Jamieson was appointed to the position of Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer during the 2023 year and is listed as an executive officer in other sections of this annual report. However, due to the timing of his appointment, he is not deemed to be a Named Executive Officer for the 2022 year. 
 
 Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
 
 The members of the Compensation Committee of the Board are Messrs. Jennings, Lee and Petersen and Ms. LaFollette. Mr. Jennings also serves as the Chief Executive Officer and President of HLS. Mr. Petersen was nominated to serve on the Board by REH Company pursuant to the terms of the Unitholders Agreement and provided consulting services to HF Sinclair in 2022 pursuant to the terms of a consulting agreement with HF Sinclair, each of which are discussed in detail under Item 13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. With the exception of the relationships disclosed for Mr. Petersen, none of the members who served on the Compensation Committee at any time during 2022 had any relationship requiring disclosure under Item 13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. No executive officer of HLS served as a member of the compensation committee of another entity that had an executive officer serving as a member of our Board or our Compensation Committee. No executive officer of HLS served as a member of the board of another entity that had an executive officer serving as a member of our Compensation Committee, except that Mr. Jennings also serves as the Chief Executive Officer of HF Sinclair. 
 
 Fees and Reimbursements for Compensation of Named Executive Officers 
 
 Administrative Fee Covers HF Sinclair Shared Officers. Under the terms of the Omnibus Agreement we pay an annual administrative fee to HF Sinclair (currently 5.0 million) for the provision of general and administrative services for our benefit, which may be increased or decreased as permitted under the Omnibus Agreement. The administrative services covered by the Omnibus Agreement include, without limitation, the costs of corporate services provided to us by HF Sinclair such as accounting, tax, information technology, human resources, in-house legal support and office space, furnishings and equipment. None of the services covered by the administrative fee are assigned any particular value individually. Although the administrative fee covers the services provided to us by the Named Executive Officers who are HF Sinclair Shared Officers, no portion of the administrative fee is specifically allocated to services provided by those Named Executive Officers to us. Rather, the administrative fee generally covers services provided to us by HF Sinclair and, except as described below, there is no reimbursement by us for the specific costs of such services. Typically we reflect our allocated amounts into cash compensation columns of the Summary Compensation Table, namely within the Base Salary column. For the 2022 year, the portion of compensation for certain Named Executive Officers exceeded base salaries, so there was a portion of compensation allocations that were reported in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table reflecting amounts earned pursuant to the HF Sinclair annual incentive bonus plan. A discussion 
 - 127 - 

A 

 of the non-equity incentive compensation payable by HF Sinclair will be disclosed in HF Sinclair s 2023 Proxy Statement. See Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of our relationships and transactions with HF Sinclair. 
 
 Reimbursements for Compensation of Dedicated HLS Officers. Under the Omnibus Agreement, we also reimburse HF Sinclair for certain expenses incurred on our behalf, such as for salaries and employee benefits for certain personnel employed by HF Sinclair who perform services for us on behalf of HLS, including the dedicated HLS officers, as described in greater detail below. The partnership agreement provides that our general partner will determine the expenses that are allocable to us. In 2022, we reimbursed HF Sinclair for 100 of the compensation expenses incurred by HF Sinclair for salary, bonus, retirement and other benefits provided to Mr. Cunningham. With respect to equity compensation paid by us to Mr. Cunningham and Mr. Voliva, HLS purchases the units delivered pursuant to awards under our Long-Term Incentive Plan, and we reimburse HLS for the purchase price of the units. 
 
 Compensation Decisions for Dedicated HLS Officers 
 
 Generally. The Compensation Committee, pursuant to its charter, determines cash and bonus compensation only for HLS s Chief Executive Officer, President or Chief Financial Officer if such officers are solely dedicated to HLS and are not HF Sinclair Shared Officers. During 2022, HLS s Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Financial Officer were HF Sinclair Shared Officers, and as a result, the Compensation Committee did not set cash and bonus compensation for any executive officer. For 2022, the Compensation Committee made compensation recommendations, which were subsequently approved by the Board, for Mr. Cunningham only with respect to the terms of his consulting arrangement with HLS following his Retirement. The terms of Mr. Cunningham's consulting arrangement with HLS are described in the section below titled "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control - Retirement Consulting Arrangements with Mr. Cunningham." All other compensation provided to Mr. Cunningham for 2022, other than with respect to pension and retirement benefits as described below, was determined by the Chief Executive Officer and President of HLS and is reported, in accordance with SEC rules, in the tables that follow. 
 
 Pension and Retirement Benefits. The Compensation Committee does not review or approve pension or retirement benefits for any of the Named Executive Officers. Rather, all pension and retirement benefits provided to the executives are the same pension and retirement benefits that are provided to employees of HF Sinclair generally, and such benefits are sponsored and administered entirely by HF Sinclair without input from HLS or the Compensation Committee. The pension and retirement benefits provided to Mr. Cunningham in 2022 are described below and were charged to us monthly in accordance with the Omnibus Agreement. 
 
 Allocation of Compensation and Compensation Decisions for HF Sinclair Shared Officers 
 
 Generally. HF Sinclair makes all decisions regarding the compensation paid to the HF Sinclair Shared Officers, which compensation is covered by the administrative fee under the Omnibus Agreement (and therefore not subject to reimbursement by us); however, in accordance with SEC rules, for purposes of these disclosures, a portion of the compensation paid by HF Sinclair to the HF Sinclair Shared Officers for 2022 is allocated to the services they performed for us during 2022. The allocation was made based on the assumption that each of Messrs. Jennings and Harrison and Ms. Bhatia, and Mr. Voliva, prior to his separation, spent, in the aggregate, the following percentage of his or her professional time on our business and affairs in 2022: 
 
 Name Percentage of Time Michael C. Jennings 25 John Harrison 25 Richard L. Voliva III 35 Vaishali S. Bhatia 25 

Because HF Sinclair made all decisions regarding the compensation paid to Messrs. Jennings, Voliva and Harrison and Ms. Bhatia for 2022, except for the decision regarding Mr. Voliva s participation in HEP s annual cash incentive program as a result of his expanded responsibilities with HLS and HEP in 2022, those decisions are not discussed in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis. The total compensation paid by HF Sinclair to Messrs. Jennings and Voliva and Ms. Bhatia in 2022 will be 
 - 128 - 

A 

 disclosed in HF Sinclair s 2023 Proxy Statement. The compensation paid by HF Sinclair to Mr. Harrison is discussed and disclosed in the tables that follow. 
 
 Objectives of Compensation Program 
 
 Our compensation program is designed to attract and retain talented and productive executives who are motivated to protect and enhance our long-term value for the benefit of our unitholders. Our objective is to be competitive with our industry and encourage high levels of performance from our executives. 
 
 In supporting our objectives, in applicable years, the Compensation Committee considers the cash compensation to be received by the dedicated HLS officers when determining equity compensation for the dedicated HLS officers; however, the Compensation Committee has not adopted any formal policies for allocating compensation among salary, bonus and long-term equity compensation. 
 
 In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Compensation Committee, with the assistance of the Chief Executive Officer and President, reviewed the consulting arrangement for Mr. Cunningham with a goal of retaining his expertise to facilitate an orderly transition of his responsibilities following his Retirement. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2021, the Chief Executive Officer reviewed the contributions and responsibilities of Mr. Voliva, and made the decision that Mr. Voliva would participate in HEP s annual incentive cash compensation program for 2022 in light of his increased responsibilities for HLS and HEP following Mr. Cunningham s Retirement. 
 
 Role of the Compensation Consultant and the Compensation Committee in the Compensation Setting Process 
 
 Since 2018, the Compensation Committee has retained Meridian, a consulting firm specializing in executive compensation, to advise the Compensation Committee on matters related to executive and non-employee director compensation, including benchmarking of the compensation peer group for non-employee director compensation, and long-term equity incentive awards. The Compensation Consultant provided the Compensation Committee with market data, updates on related trends and developments, advice on program design, and input on compensation decisions for executive officers and non-employee directors. As discussed above under The Board, Its Committees and Director Compensation Board Committees Compensation Committee, the Compensation Committee has concluded that we do not have any conflicts of interest with Meridian. 
 
 The Compensation Committee generally makes compensation decisions for a given fiscal year in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The Compensation Consultant does not have authority to determine the ultimate compensation paid to executive officers or non-employee directors, and the Compensation Committee is under no obligation to utilize the information provided by the Compensation Consultant when making compensation decisions. The Compensation Consultant provides external context and other input to the Compensation Committee prior to the Compensation Committee approving salaries and fees, awarding bonuses and equity compensation or establishing awards for the upcoming year. Meridian provided information and advice to the Compensation Committee in 2021 and 2022 with respect to matters related to executive compensation related trends, regulatory and legislative developments, review of the compensation benchmarking peer group and performance peer group for long-term incentive plan performance comparisons, benchmarking of non-employee director compensation, and development of a severance pay plan. The Compensation Committee is aware that Meridian is also providing similar services to the compensation committee at HF Sinclair but our Compensation Committee manages its relationship with Meridian independently of the relationship that Meridian has with the HF Sinclair compensation committee. The aggregate amount of fees HLS paid to Meridian for the services it engaged Meridian to perform during the 2022 fiscal year was approximately 26,213. The aggregate amount of fees HF Sinclair paid to Meridian for the services it engaged Meridian to perform during the 2022 fiscal year was approximately 278,686. 
 
 The Compensation Committee, pursuant to its charter, determines cash and annual incentive compensation for only HLS s Chief Executive Officer, President or Chief Financial Officer, if such officers are solely dedicated to HLS and are not HF Sinclair Shared Officers. For all HLS officers who are eligible to receive equity awards under HEP s equity plans, the Compensation Committee will review and recommend to the Board for approval, long-term equity incentive compensation. 
 
 Review of Market Data 
 
 Market pay levels are one of many factors considered by the Compensation Committee in setting equity compensation for the Named Executive Officers. In 2021, the Compensation Committee reviewed comparison data provided by the Compensation Consultant with respect to annual incentive levels and long-term incentive levels as one point of reference in evaluating the reasonableness and competitiveness of the incentive compensation paid to our executive officers as compared to companies 
 - 129 - 

A 

 with which we compete for executive talent. In addition, the Compensation Committee reviewed such data to evaluate whether our incentive compensation reflects practices of comparable companies of generally similar size and scope of operations. The Compensation Consultant obtained market information primarily from SEC filings of publicly traded companies that the Compensation Consultant and the Compensation Committee consider appropriate peer group companies and, from time to time, from published compensation surveys (such as the Liquid Pipeline Roundtable Compensation Survey ). The purpose of the peer group is to provide a frame of reference with respect to executive equity compensation at companies of generally comparable size and scope of operations, rather than to set specific benchmarks for the compensation provided to the Named Executive Officers. We select peer group companies that we believe provide relevant data points for our consideration. 
 
 The peer group used in determining 2022 equity compensation included the following companies, which are representative of the companies with which we compete for talent: 
 
 Antero Midstream Corporation Enable Midstream Partners, LP Black Stone Minerals, L.P. EnLink Midstream, LLC Callon Petroleum Company Phillips 66 Partners LP Centennial Resource Development, Inc. Shell Midstream Partners, L.P. Crestwood Equity Partners LP Summit Midstream Partners, LP Delek Logistics Partners, LP 
 
 The peer group used for 2022 compensation was reduced by one company from the peer group used with respect to 2021 compensation due to merger activity and recommendations from the Compensation Consultant. 
 
 For years in which we make the compensation decisions for our executive officers, our objective generally is to position pay at levels approximately in the middle range of market practice, taking into account median levels derived from our peer group analysis. Following advice from the Compensation Consultant, we consider our salary and non-salary compensation components relative to the median compensation levels generally within the peer group rather than to an exact percentile above or below the median. For these purposes, if compensation is generally within plus or minus 20 of the market median, it is considered to be in the middle range of the market. As noted, however, this market analysis is just one of many factors considered when making overall compensation decisions for our executives. 
 
 Role of Named Executive Officers in Determining Executive Compensation 
 
 In making executive equity compensation decisions for Named Executive Officers that are solely dedicated to HLS, the Compensation Committee typically reviews the total compensation provided in the prior year, overall performance and market data provided by the Compensation Consultant. The Compensation Committee also considers recommendations by the Chief Executive Officer and President and other factors in determining the appropriate final equity compensation amounts to recommend to the Board. 
 
 Various members of management facilitate the Compensation Committee s consideration of equity compensation for Named Executive Officers by providing data for the Compensation Committee s review. This data includes, but is not limited to, performance evaluations, performance-based compensation provided to the Named Executive Officers in previous years, tax-related considerations and accounting-related considerations. Given the day-to-day familiarity that management has with the work performed, the Compensation Committee values management s recommendations, although no Named Executive Officer has authority to determine or comment on compensation decisions directly related to himself or herself. Due to the planned transition of his responsibilities effective January 1, 2022 in preparation for his Retirement, no long-term equity compensation was recommended for Mr. Cunningham for 2022. To assist with the orderly transition of Mr. Cunningham s responsibilities following his Retirement, management recommended and the Compensation Committee reviewed and made a recommendation to the Board, which subsequently approved, the terms of a consulting arrangement between HLS and Mr. Cunningham for a period of 12 months commencing on February 19, 2022. See the section below titled Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control - Retirement Consulting Arrangements with Mr. Cunningham for a discussion of the terms of Mr. Cunningham s consulting arrangement with HLS. 
 
 In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Chief Executive Officer and President were separate individuals. The Chief Executive Officer set 2022 compensation for his direct reports who were solely dedicated to HLS and who did not serve as President of HLS, and the President set 2022 compensation for his direct reports who were solely dedicated to HLS and who did not serve as Chief Financial Officer of HLS. In September 2022, the Board delegated authority to the Chief Executive Officer to negotiate, and to a subcommittee of the Compensation Committee to approve, the final terms of Mr. Voliva s mutual separation agreement, 
 - 130 - 

A 

 specifically as it related to accelerated vesting of his outstanding phantom unit award and 2022 annual cash incentive bonus, each of which are discussed further below. 
 
 Overview of 2022 Executive Compensation Components and Decisions 
 
 Mr. Cunningham was the only Named Executive Officer solely dedicated to HLS during 2022. In addition to the consulting compensation and accelerated vesting of long-term equity incentive compensation described further below in the section titled Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control - Retirement Consulting Arrangements with Mr. Cunningham the components of compensation received by Mr. Cunningham in 2022 are as follows: 
 
 base salary; 
 annual incentive cash bonus compensation; 
 severance and change in control benefits; 
 health and retirement benefits; and 
 perquisites. 
 
 Each of these components is described in further detail in the narratives and/or tables that follow. 
 
 In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2021, the Chief Executive Officer reviewed the contributions and responsibilities of Mr. Voliva, then President of HLS and an HF Sinclair Shared Officer, and determined that Mr. Voliva would participate in HEP s annual incentive cash bonus compensation program for 2022 in light of his increased responsibilities for HLS and HEP following Mr. Cunningham s Retirement. The terms of Mr. Voliva s annual incentive cash bonus award and the determination of his final payout upon his separation are discussed below in the section titled Annual Incentive Cash Bonus Compensation. 
 
 Base Salary 
 
 Base salary for Mr. Cunningham for 2022 was determined by the then-current President of HLS in the fourth quarter of 2021. The President considered Mr. Cunningham s position, performance in 2021, and the forthcoming transition of his responsibilities to four different individuals at HLS, effective January 1, 2022, in preparation for his Retirement. Following a review of the various factors listed above, Mr. Cunningham s 2022 base salary remained unchanged from 2021 at 342,505. 
 
 Annual Incentive Cash Bonus Compensation 
 
 The performance period for HEP s 2022 annual incentive cash bonus program commenced on October 1, 2021 and ended on September 30, 2022. Target awards and performance metrics for the 2022 annual incentive cash bonus program for Mr. Cunningham were determined by the then-current President of HLS in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
 
 Historically, HF Sinclair Shared Officers have not participated in HEP s annual incentive cash bonus program. However, in October 2021, the Chief Executive Officer reviewed the contributions of Mr. Voliva, then President of HLS and an HF Sinclair Shared Officer, and determined that Mr. Voliva would participate in HEP s 2022 annual incentive cash bonus program in light of his increased responsibilities for HLS and HEP in 2022 following Mr. Cunningham s Retirement. 
 
 As Mr. Voliva was an HF Sinclair Shared Officer and did not receive a separate base salary solely for his contributions to HLS and HEP in 2022, the Chief Executive Officer set his target bonus opportunity at 400,000, based on a target bonus percentage of 100 and subject to the financial, operational and strategic and individual performance measures applicable to other participants in the annual incentive cash bonus program as described below. 
 
 Any annual incentive cash bonus compensation granted by HF Sinclair for 2022 to any of the HF Sinclair Shared Officers will be disclosed in HF Sinclair s 2023 Proxy Statement to the extent such individuals are named executive officers of HF Sinclair for the 2022 fiscal year. 
 
 The following table sets forth the minimum, target and maximum award opportunities for Mr. Cunningham (as a percentage of annual base salary) and Mr. Voliva (as a percentage of his 400,000 target bonus opportunity) for 2022, and the portion of the target award opportunity that is allocated to each performance measure (as a percentage of his annual base salary for Mr. Cunningham and as a percentage of target bonus opportunity for Mr. Voliva). The target percentages for Mr. Cunningham were unchanged from the 2021 year. Mr. Voliva did not participate in the annual incentive cash bonus program in the 2021 year.

 The financial measures are weighted equally with the operational measures. Awards are capped to avoid encouraging an excessive short-term focus, potentially at the expense of long-term performance. 
 To facilitate timely determination of award payouts, the measurement period for each of the above metrics covers four consecutive quarters starting with the fourth quarter of the preceding year (2021) and ending with the third quarter of the following year (2022). 
 These awards were subject to our achievement of specified levels of performance with respect to financial, operational and strategic and individual performance measures. The following table sets forth the various components for each measure.

(1) The EHS metric is divided into the following four equally weighted measures: 
 Recordable Injury Rate, which is based on the number of employees out of 100 that have been involved in a recordable event. 
 Lost Time Injury, which is based on the number of injuries causing an employee to miss work. 
 Vehicle Incidents, which is based on the number of incidents generating greater than 5,000 of property damage per 1,000,000 miles driven by HEP employees. 
 Employee Based Environmental Releases, which is based on loss of containment caused by an employee that is reportable to either a state or federal agency. 
 (2) The reliability metric is based on the weighted average Solomon Liquid Pipeline Availability. 
 (3) Operating Expense includes all direct and controllable cash operating costs, which includes Selling, General and Administrative (SG A) costs. Budgeted costs exclude asset write-downs, impairments, inventory valuation charges, unbudgeted litigation and legal settlement costs, environmental charges resulting from events which occurred prior to the beginning of the performance period, variable energy and utility costs, and unbudgeted bonus expenses and costs

Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation 
 
 The Long-Term Incentive Plan was adopted by the Board in August 2004 with the objective of: 
 
 promoting our interests by providing equity incentive compensation awards to eligible individuals; 
 
 enhancing our ability to attract and retain the services of individuals who are essential for our growth and profitability; 
 
 encouraging those individuals to devote their best efforts to advancing our business; and 
 
 aligning the interests of those individuals with the interests of our unitholders. 
 
 In determining the appropriate amount and type of long-term equity incentive awards to be granted each year, the Compensation Committee and the Board consider the executive s position, scope of responsibility, base salary and available compensation information for executives in comparable positions in similar companies. Our goal is to reward the creation of value and strong performance with variable compensation dependent on that performance. 
 
 The Compensation Committee and the Board typically grant long-term equity incentive awards to dedicated HLS officers on an annual basis. Annual long-term equity incentive award grants are made in the fourth quarter of the year preceding the year to which the award relates, in order to align the timing of the long-term equity incentive award grants with the timing of the other compensation decisions made for the dedicated HLS officers. However, due to Mr. Cunningham s planned Retirement, management did not recommend, and the Board did not grant, a long-term equity incentive award to Mr. Cunningham in October 2021 for the 2022 year. 
 
 In connection with Mr. Cunningham s Retirement, (i) 2,092 phantom units granted under his 2019 and 2020 phantom unit awards vested on a pro rata basis in an amount attributable to the portion of the service period Mr. Cunningham completed during the applicable vesting period and the remainder of the unvested phantom unit awards were forfeited and (ii) 10,889 performance units granted under his 2019 and 2020 performance unit awards vested on a pro rata basis in an amount attributable to the portion of the service period Mr. Cunningham completed during the applicable vesting period multiplied by the target number of performance units awarded and the remainder of the unvested 2019 and 2020 performance unit awards were forfeited. His vested phantom unit and performance unit awards settled six months following his Retirement Date (as defined below) as Mr. Cunningham was subject to certain executive officer level deferral requirements imposed by Section 409A of the Code. The terms of Mr. Cunningham s 2019 and 2020 phantom unit and performance unit awards were previously disclosed in Part III of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the periods ending December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 
 
 It is generally our practice not to make long-term equity incentive award grants to the HF Sinclair Shared Officers. Any equity compensation awards granted by HF Sinclair for 2022 to any of the HF Sinclair Shared Officers will be disclosed in HF Sinclair s 2023 Proxy Statement to the extent such individuals are named executive officers of HF Sinclair for the 2022 year.

 Acquisition of Common Units for Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards 
 
 Common units delivered in connection with long-term equity incentive awards may be common units acquired by HLS on the open market, common units already owned by HLS, common units acquired by HLS directly from us or any other person or any combination of the foregoing. We currently do not hold treasury units. HLS is entitled to reimbursement by us for the cost of acquiring the common units utilized for the grant or settlement of long-term equity incentive awards. 
 
 Retirement and Other Benefits 
 
 Our Named Executive Officers participate in certain retirement plans sponsored and maintained by HF Sinclair. The cost of retirement benefits for dedicated HLS officers is charged monthly to us in accordance with the terms of the Omnibus Agreement. The terms of these benefit arrangements are described below. 
 
 Defined Contribution Plan 
 
 For 2022, Mr. Cunningham was eligible to participate in the HF Sinclair Corporation 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan, a tax qualified defined contribution plan (the 401(k) Plan ). Employees may contribute amounts between 0 and 75 of their eligible compensation to the 401(k) Plan. Employee contributions that were made on a tax-deferred basis were generally limited to 20,500 for 2022, with employees 50 years of age or over able to make additional tax-deferred contributions of 6,500. 
 
 For 2022, all employees received an employer retirement contribution to the 401(k) Plan of 3 to 8 of the participating employee s eligible compensation under the 401(k) Plan, subject to applicable Internal Revenue Code limitations, based on years of service, as follows: 
 Years of Service Retirement Contribution (as percentage of eligible compensation) Less than 5 years 3 5 to 10 years 4 10 to 15 years 5.25 15 to 20 years 6.5 20 years and over 8 
 
 In addition to the retirement contribution, in 2022, employees received employer matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan equal to 100 of the first 6 of the employee s eligible compensation contributed to the 401(k) plan up to compensation limits. Matching contributions vest immediately, and retirement contributions are subject to a three-year cliff-vesting period. 
 
 The 401(k) Plan benefits for Mr. Cunningham were charged to us in 2022 pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement. 
 
 Deferred Compensation Plan 
 
 In 2022, Mr. Cunningham was eligible to participate in the NQDC Plan. The NQDC Plan provides certain management and other highly compensated employees an opportunity to defer compensation in excess of qualified retirement plan limitations on a pre-tax basis and accumulate tax-deferred earnings to achieve their financial goals. 
 
 Participants in the NQDC Plan can contribute between 1 and 50 of their eligible earnings, which includes base salary and bonuses, to the NQDC Plan. Participants in the NQDC Plan may also receive certain employer-provided contributions, matching restoration contributions, retirement restoration contributions, and nonqualified nonelective contributions. Matching restoration contributions and retirement restoration contributions represent contribution amounts that could not be made under the 401(k) Plan due to Internal Revenue Code limitations on tax-qualified plans. Participants in the NQDC Plan are entitled to make independent deferral elections to the NQDC Plan and the 401(k) Plan, regardless of whether the individual has met the contribution limitations under the 401(k) Plan. See the narrative preceding the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table for additional information regarding these contributions and the other terms and conditions of the NQDC Plan. 
 
 The NQDC Plan benefits for Mr. Cunningham were charged to us in 2022 pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement.

 Other Benefits and Perquisites 
 
 Our Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the same health and welfare benefit plans, including medical, dental, life insurance, and disability programs sponsored and maintained by HF Sinclair, that are generally made available to all full-time employees of HF Sinclair. Health and welfare benefits for Mr. Cunningham were charged to us in 2022 pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement. In August 2022, Mr. Cunningham received a retiree health contribution of 25,645, representing 50 of his COBRA rate for the high deductible health plan/no health savings account option for the tier of coverage in effect under the HF Sinclair medical plan at the time of his Retirement multiplied by 36. As a highly compensated employee, payment of Mr. Cunningham's contribution was deferred pursuant to Section 409A of the Code and paid to him in a lump sum cash payment 
 
 It is the Compensation Committee s policy to provide only limited perquisites to our Named Executive Officers. We provided a reserved parking space for Mr. Cunningham in 2022. In addition, we may also reimburse our executive officers for limited entertainment expenses that we deem to serve a business purpose and provide personal benefits to our executive officers in limited circumstances associated with executive team-building and strategy planning events. 
 
 Change in Control Agreements 
 
 Neither we nor HLS has entered into any employment agreements with any of the Named Executive Officers. On February 14, 2011, the Board adopted the Holly Energy Partners, L.P. Change in Control Policy (the Change in Control Policy and the related form of Change in Control Agreement for certain officers of HLS (each, a Change in Control Agreement ). The Change in Control Agreements contain double-trigger payment provisions that require not only a change in control of HF Sinclair, HLS or HEP, but also a qualifying termination of the executive s employment within a specified period of time following the change in control in order for an officer to be entitled to benefits. We believe the Change in Control Agreements provide for management continuity in the event of a change in control and provide competitive benefits for the recruitment and retention of executives. 
 
 We entered into a Change in Control Agreement with Mr. Voliva, effective as of April 28, 2014, and Mr. Cunningham, effective as of February 14, 2011, in accordance with the Change in Control Policy. The Change in Control Agreement with Mr. Voliva was terminated effective October 31, 2016 when Mr. Voliva entered into a Change in Control Agreement with HF Sinclair. The Change in Control Agreement with Mr. Cunningham was terminated effective February 18, 2022 when Mr. Cunningham retired. 
 
 HF Sinclair entered into Change in Control Agreements with Messrs. Jennings, Voliva and Harrison and Ms. Bhatia, which were in effect during 2022 and the costs of which are fully borne by HF Sinclair (the HF Sinclair Change in Control Agreements ). Payments and benefits under the HF Sinclair Change in Control Agreements are triggered only upon a change in control of HF Sinclair. The HF Sinclair Change in Control Agreement with Mr. Voliva was terminated effective September 15, 2022 when Mr. Voliva separated. The material terms, and the qualification, of the potential amounts payable under the HF Sinclair Change in Control Agreements with Mr. Jennings and Ms. Bhatia will be described in HF Sinclair s 2023 Proxy Statement. 
 
 Severance Pay Plan 
 
 On October 25, 2022, the Board adopted the Severance Pay Plan pursuant to which members of senior management or other executives whose services are solely dedicated to HLS, as designated by HLS, will be eligible to receive the severance benefits provided for under the Severance Pay Plan, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Severance Pay Plan and the individual participation agreements which will specify the terms and conditions for each eligible participant and shall govern to the extent such terms vary from the Severance Pay Plan. The Severance Pay Plan was not applicable to any Named Executive Officers during the 2022 year, although we are including a description of the potential benefits that we put in place for future dedicated HLS Named Executive Officers. HF Sinclair has its own severance pay plan applicable to HF Sinclair Shared Officers, which will be disclosed in HF Sinclair's 2023 Proxy Statement, as applicable. 
 
 Unless otherwise specified in an individual participation agreement, upon a termination without Cause (as defined below) by HLS, the participant will be eligible to receive the following benefits: 
 
 a cash payment, payable in 12 monthly installments, equal to a percentage of such participant s annual base salary, plus the amount of bonus, if any, that would have been paid under the annual cash incentive compensation program (paid as if HLS had achieved target level of performance for the year of the participant s termination); and 
 
 - 136 - 

A 

 continuation coverage for the individual and his or her eligible dependents under our group health plans pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, for twelve months at active employee rates, unless such coverage is earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the Severance Pay Plan. 
 
 The applicable percentage of annual base salary and bonus (if any) will be determined based on the officer s pay grade classification in accordance with the following chart: 
 
 E3 (CEO) 200 + 100 target bonus E1, E2 100 + 100 target bonus M5 100 
 
 Pursuant to the Severance Pay Plan, a termination for Cause means (a) an act or acts of dishonesty by a participant constituting a felony or serious misdemeanor and resulting or intended to result directly in gain or personal enrichment at the expense of HLS or any subsidiary; (b) gross or willful and wanton negligence in the performance of a participant s material and substantial duties of employment with HLS and its subsidiaries; or (c) a participant s conviction of a felony involving moral turpitude. The existence of Cause shall be determined by HLS, in its sole and absolute discretion. 
 
 Unit Ownership and Retention Policy for Executives 
 
 The Board, the Compensation Committee and our executive officers recognize that ownership of our common units is an effective means by which to align the interests of our officers with those of our unitholders. The dedicated HLS officers are subject to the HEP unit ownership and retention policy. The unit retention requirement for Mr. Cunningham prior to his Retirement was as follows: 
 
 Executive Officer Value of Units Mark T. Cunningham 1x Base Salary 
 
 Each covered officer is required to meet the applicable requirements within five years of first being subject to the policy. Officers are required to continuously own sufficient units to meet the unit ownership and retention requirements once attained. Until the officers attain compliance with the unit ownership and retention policy, the officers will be required to hold 25 of the units received from any equity award, net of any units used to pay the exercise price or tax withholdings. If an officer attains compliance with the unit ownership and retention policy and subsequently falls below the requirement because of a decrease in the price of our common units, the officer will be deemed in compliance provided that the officer retains the units then held. 
 
 As of his Retirement Date, Mr. Cunningham was in compliance with the HEP unit ownership and retention policy. As of December 31, 2022, there were no Named Executive Officers subject to the HEP unit ownership and retention policy. 
 
 Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policy 
 
 All of our employees, including our Named Executive Officers, are subject to our Insider Trading Policy, which, among other things, prohibits employees from entering into short sales or hedging or pledging shares of our common units and HF Sinclair common stock. The anti-hedging policy contained in our Insider Trading Policy specifically prohibits employees, including our named executive officers, and their designees from purchasing financial instruments or otherwise engaging in transactions that hedge or offset or are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of HEP or HF Sinclair securities (or derivatives thereof), including through, among other mechanisms, the purchase of financial instruments (such as prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds) or other transactions that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of our securities. Additionally, all employees, including our named executive officers, are prohibited from holding our securities in a margin account or otherwise pledging our securities as collateral for a loan. 
 
 Tax and Accounting Implications 
 
 We account for equity compensation expenses under the rules of FASB ASC Topic 718, which requires us to estimate and record an expense for each award of equity compensation over the vesting period of the award. Accounting rules also require us to record cash compensation as an expense at the time the obligation is accrued. The Compensation Committee has taken 
 - 137 - 

A 

 into account the tax implications to us in its decision to grant long-term equity incentive compensation awards in the form of phantom units and performance units as opposed to options or unit appreciation rights. 
 
 Recoupment of Compensation 
 
 In October 2021, the Board revised its formal clawback policy originally adopted by the Board in 2018 (the Clawback Policy to expand the applicability of the policy to former employees who are determined to have engaged in conduct in violation of the policy during their employment and to add a misconduct prong permitting the clawback of compensation for employees and former employees who are determined to have engaged in Misconduct (as defined below). The Clawback Policy provides that upon the occurrence of a material restatement of our financial statements (other than due to a change in accounting policy or applicable law) or upon certain acts of Misconduct, the Board may recover bonus and other incentive and equity based compensation (the Incentive Compensation awarded to Board appointed officers of HLS and our subsidiaries. The Clawback Policy applies to both current and former employees who are Board appointed officers of HLS and our subsidiaries; provided, however, that the Clawback Policy only applies to Incentive Compensation awarded on or after November 1, 2021 for Board appointed officers who are former employees. 
 
 In the case of a material restatement of our financial statements (other than due to a change in accounting policy or applicable law), the Board may recover Incentive Compensation that was paid or awarded during the 24-month period preceding the restatement from such officers. In the event of such material restatement, if the Incentive Compensation would have been lower had it been calculated based on such restated results, the Compensation Committee may (as determined in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted by governing law and as appropriate under the circumstances) seek to recover for our benefit all or a portion of such Incentive Compensation awarded to any covered employee. In determining whether to seek recovery, the Compensation Committee may take into account any considerations as it deems appropriate, including whether the error was caused by intentional misconduct or fraud. The amount of any recovery and the source of such recovery (whether from unvested equity compensation or future compensation payable to the covered employee) will be determined in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee. 
 
 In any instance in which a current Board appointed officer of HLS or our subsidiaries or a former Board appointed officer employed by HLS or our subsidiaries at any point during the twelve-month period preceding the date the Compensation Committee is notified of an event of Misconduct, which is defined to include any of the following acts or events (each an act of Misconduct ): 
 
 an act or acts of dishonesty constituting a felony or serious misdemeanor and resulting or intended to result directly in gain or personal enrichment at the expense of HLS, HEP or any of its subsidiaries; 
 gross or willful and wanton negligence in the performance of such officer s material and substantial duties of employment with HLS, HEP and its subsidiaries; or 
 conviction of a felony involving moral turpitude; 
 
 the Compensation Committee may (as determined in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted by governing law and as appropriate under the circumstances) cause HLS to (a) seek recovery of Incentive Compensation that such officer was awarded or vested within the prior 24-month period or at any time during or following the Misconduct and/or (b) cancel such officer s unvested, unearned or unsettled Incentive Compensation without consideration; provided, however, that recoupment of Incentive Compensation from former employees only applies to Incentive Compensation awarded on or after November 1, 2021. 
 
 Additionally, equity awards granted to Named Executive Officers are subject to the terms of the Long-Term Incentive Plan, which states that such awards may be cancelled, repurchased and/or recouped to the extent required by applicable law or any clawback policy that we adopt. In addition, the award agreements for our outstanding long-term incentive compensation awards state that the award and amounts paid or realized with respect to the award may be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment to the extent required by applicable law or any clawback policy that we adopt.

 (1) Represents the aggregate grant date fair value of awards of equity awards made in the year indicated computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, determined without regard to forfeitures, and does not reflect the actual value that may be recognized by the executive. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 for a discussion of the assumptions used in determining the FASB ASC Topic 718 grant date fair value of these awards. 
 
 For Mr. Cunningham, awards for the 2021 fiscal year granted in October 2020 are reported in the Unit Awards column of the Summary Compensation Table for 2020, in accordance with SEC rules. Mr. Cunningham did not receive an award for the 2022 year due to his Retirement in February 2022. 
 
 For Mr. Voliva, the award reflected in 2020 was a grant of phantom units in recognition of his contributions to HLS for the 2020 fiscal year, including his advancement of business development opportunities and his oversight of growth projects. 
 
 (2) Generally represents the annual incentive amount, if any, paid under our annual incentive cash bonus program. The 2022 award amounts under our annual incentive cash bonus program are described above in greater detail under Compensation Discussion and Analysis Overview of 2022 Executive Compensation Components and Decisions Annual Incentive Cash Bonus Compensation. See Note 4 to the Summary Compensation Table for a discussion of the amounts reported as Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation with respect to Messrs. Jennings, Voliva and Harrison and Ms. Bhatia for 2022. Although these amounts are reported in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column, they represent incentive

 compensation determined by and earned pursuant to the HF Sinclair annual incentive bonus program, with the exception of Mr. Voliva whose reported amount includes: (i) a 2022 annual incentive cash bonus of 600,000 under our annual incentive cash bonus program paid pursuant to the terms of his Separation Agreement and (ii) an allocation of compensation determined by and earned pursuant to the HF Sinclair annual incentive bonus program in the amount of 113,965. Although Mr. Voliva's annual incentive cash bonus amount was determined prior to the end of the original performance period, the amount was determined based on the estimate of what he had earned at that time, therefore, this is reported as a payment of his regular annual incentive bonus rather than as a separation payment. 
 
 (3) For 2022, includes the compensation as described under All Other Compensation below. 
 
 (4) During 2022, each of these officers split their professional time between HF Sinclair and us, and all compensation paid to the officer for 2022 was determined and paid by HF Sinclair, with the exception of the 2022 HEP annual incentive cash bonus paid by HLS to Mr. Voliva of 600,000 (which is reported in the table for Mr. Voliva under the "Non-equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column). In accordance with SEC rules, for purposes of these disclosures, a portion of the total compensation paid by HF Sinclair to these officers for 2022 is allocated to the services the officer performed for us during 2022. The allocation was made based on the assumption that each officer spent, in the aggregate, approximately the following percentage of his professional time in 2022 on our business and affairs: 
 
 Name Percentage of Time Michael C. Jennings 25 Richard L. Voliva III 35 Vaishali S. Bhatia 25 
 
 With the exception of the 2022 HEP annual incentive cash bonus paid to Mr. Voliva of 600,000 (which is also reported in the table for Mr. Voliva under the Non-equity Incentive Plan Compensation column), only the designated percentage of the total amount of compensation each officer received from HF Sinclair for 2022 has been reported in this table, and the allocated amount has been solely attributed in the table above to the officer s base salary and non-equity incentive plan compensation. This amount represents the aggregate dollar value of total compensation paid to the officer by HF Sinclair (including base salary, non-equity incentive plan compensation, equity awards and other compensation), calculated pursuant to SEC rules, multiplied by the percentage set forth next to his name above. The total compensation paid by HF Sinclair to Messrs. Jennings and Voliva and Ms. Bhatia (including the portion of their salary and non-equity incentive compensation reported in this table), and a discussion of how the total amount of the officer s non-equity incentive plan compensation for 2022 was determined, will be disclosed in HF Sinclair s 2023 Proxy Statement. Mr. Harrison is not expected to be a named executive officer with respect to HF Sinclair, therefore, his compensation arrangements are described in Note 5 below. 
 
 (5) During 2022, Mr. Harrison split his professional time between HF Sinclair and us, and all compensation paid to him for 2022 was determined and paid by HF Sinclair. In accordance with SEC rules, for purposes of these disclosures, a portion of the total compensation paid by HF Sinclair to him for 2022 is allocated to the services he performed for us during 2022. The allocation was made based on the assumption that he spent, in the aggregate, approximately 25 of his professional time in 2022 on our business and affairs. 
 
 As a result, only the designated percentage of the total amount of compensation Mr. Harrison received from HF Sinclair for 2022 has been reported in this table, and the allocated amount has been solely attributed in the table above to his base salary. This amount represents the aggregate dollar value of total compensation paid to him by HF Sinclair (including base salary, bonus, non-equity incentive plan compensation, equity awards and other compensation), calculated pursuant to SEC rules, multiplied by 25 . The total compensation paid by HF Sinclair to Mr. Harrison in 2022 (including the portion of his salary reported in this table) is as follows: (i) salary of 310,923 for the entirety of 2022, (ii) a one-time discretionary bonus of 25,000 relating to a successful corporate acquisition consummated in 2022, (iii) a retention bonus of 100,000, (iv) stock awards of 347,527, which reflect the aggregate grant date fair value of awards of restricted stock units and performance share units granted by HF Sinclair to Mr. Harrison in November 2022 (2,661 restricted stock units and 2,661 performance share units (at target), based on a grant date closing price of 62.64 for HF Sinclair s common stock), calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, (v) a cash incentive award pursuant to the Long-Term Incentive Plan of 166,668, which vests over a three-year period in increments of one-third starting on December 1, 2023, (vi) 236,482 pursuant to HF Sinclair s 2022 annual incentive cash compensation program, (vii) 38,125 in 401(k) plan matching contributions and retirement contributions in 2022, and (viii) 34,236 in NQDC Plan matching contributions and retirement contributions in 2022.

 Grants of Plan-Based Awards 
 The following table sets forth information about plan-based awards granted to our Named Executive Officers under our equity and non-equity incentive plans during 2022. In this table, awards are abbreviated as AICP for the annual incentive cash awards under our annual incentive cash bonus compensation program. 
 
 Annual long-term equity incentive awards are made once each year in the fourth quarter of the year preceding the year to which the award relates in order to align the timing of the long-term equity incentive award grants with the timing of the other compensation decisions made for our executive officers. However, none of our Named Executive Officers received equity plan-based awards from us during 2022 for the 2023 fiscal year.

Amounts reported (a) in the Threshold column reflect 50 of the Named Executive Officer s target award opportunity under the annual incentive cash compensation program, which, in accordance with SEC rules, is the minimum amount payable for a certain level of performance under the award, (b) in the Target column reflect 100 of the Named Executive Officer s target award opportunity under the annual incentive cash compensation program, which is the target amount payable under the award, and (c) in the Maximum column reflect 200 of the Named Executive Officer s target award opportunity under the annual incentive cash compensation program, which is the maximum amount payable under the award. If less than minimum levels of performance, as described in the Threshold column, are attained with respect to the financial measures, operational measures and strategic and individual measures under the annual incentive cash bonus compensation program, then 0 of the Named Executive Officer s target award opportunity will be earned. The performance targets and target awards are described under Compensation Discussion and Analysis Overview of 2022 Executive Compensation Components and Decisions Annual Incentive Cash Bonus Compensation. Although these awards were granted in the fourth quarter of 2021, they represent the 2022 Annual Incentive Plan awards and any payouts with respect to these awards are reported in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the

 Option Exercises and Units Vested 
 
 The following table provides information regarding the vesting in 2022 of phantom unit and/or performance unit awards held by the Named Executive Officers. Messrs. Jennings and Harrison and Ms. Bhatia do not currently hold any equity awards under our Long-Term Incentive Plan, and they did not have any equity awards under our Long-Term Incentive Plan that vested during 2022. The table below does not reflect any information regarding the vesting in 2022 of any HF Sinclair equity awards held by any of our Named Executive Officers, a full discussion and reporting of those awards will be disclosed in HF Sinclair's 2023 Proxy Statement to the extent such persons are named executive officers of HF Sinclair. To date, we have not granted any unit options. 
 
 The value realized from the vesting of restricted unit and phantom unit awards is generally equal to the closing price of our common units on the vesting date (or, if the vesting date is not a trading day, on the trading day immediately following the vesting date, unless provided otherwise by the applicable award agreement) multiplied by the number of units acquired on vesting. The value is calculated before payment of any applicable withholding or other income taxes.

His vested phantom unit and performance unit awards settled six months following his Retirement Date, as Mr. Cunningham was subject to certain executive officer level deferral requirements imposed by Section 409A of the Code. 
 
 (2) Includes common units that became payable to Mr. Voliva as a result of the accelerated vesting of an outstanding phantom unit award held by Mr. Voliva pursuant to the terms of his Separation Agreement. His vested phantom unit award settled on the eighth day following the date of execution of his Separation Agreement. See the section below titled "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control - Mutual Separation Agreement with Mr. Voliva" for additional information. 
 
 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation 
 
 In 2022, all of the Named Executive Officers participated in the NQDC Plan. The NQDC Plan is a nonqualified plan (i.e., not tax-qualified under Section 401 of the Code) that, in 2022, functioned as a pour-over plan, allowing key employees to defer tax on income in excess of Internal Revenue Code limits that apply under the 401(k) Plan. For 2022, the annual deferral contribution limit under the 401(k) Plan was 20,500, and the annual compensation limit was 305,000. Deferral elections

A 

 made by eligible employees under the NQDC Plan apply to the total amount of eligible earnings the employees want to contribute across both the 401(k) Plan and the NQDC Plan. Participants in the NQDC Plan are entitled to make independent deferral elections to the NQDC Plan and the 401(k) Plan prior to meeting the contribution limitations under the 401(k) Plan. Federal and state income taxes are generally not payable on income deferred under the NQDC Plan until funds are withdrawn. Eligible participants may make salary deferral contributions between 1 and 50 of eligible earnings to the NQDC Plan. Eligible earnings include base pay, bonuses and overtime, but exclude extraordinary pay such as severance, accrued vacation, equity compensation and certain other items. 
 
 Eligible participants may make salary deferral contributions between 1 and 50 of eligible earnings to the NQDC Plan. Eligible earnings include base pay, bonuses and overtime, but exclude extraordinary pay such as severance, accrued vacation, equity compensation and certain other items. For 2022, the catch-up contribution limit was 6,500. Deferral elections are irrevocable for an entire plan year and must be made prior to December 31 of the year immediately preceding the plan year. Elections will carry over to the next plan year unless changed or otherwise revoked. 
 
 Participants in the NQDC Plan are eligible to receive a matching restoration contribution with respect to their elective deferrals made up to 6 of the participant s eligible earnings for the plan year in excess of the limits under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. These matching restoration contributions are fully vested at all times. In addition, participants are eligible for a retirement restoration contribution ranging from 3 to 8 of the participant s eligible earnings for the plan year in excess of the limits under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, based on years of service, as follows: 
 
 Years of Services Retirement Contribution (as percentage of eligible compensation) Less than 5 years 3 5 to 10 years 4 10 to 15 years 5.25 15 to 20 years 6.5 20 years and over 8 
 
 Retirement restoration contributions are subject to a three-year cliff vesting period and will become fully vested in the event of the participant s death or a change in control. Participants may also receive nonqualified nonelective contributions under the NQDC Plan, which contributions may be subject to a vesting schedule determined at the time the contributions are made. 
 
 Participating employees have full discretion over how their contributions to the NQDC Plan are invested among the offered investment options, and earnings on amounts contributed to the NQDC Plan are calculated in the same manner and at the same rate as earnings on actual investments. Neither HLS nor HF Sinclair subsidizes a participant s earnings under the NQDC Plan. During 2022, the investment options offered under the NQDC Plan were the same as the investment options available to participants in the 401(k) Plan, except as follows: 
 
 the 401(k) Plan offers the TRP Target Date Retirement Fund for 2065, JP Morgan MCG, MFS Institutional International Equity, Mid Cap Value R1 Fund, Principal Stable Value Z Fund, Wilmington Emerging Markets R1 Fund, Principal Self-Directed Brokerage Account, and the stock of HF Sinclair and BP PLC; and 
 
 the NQDC Plan instead offers the Invesco Oppenheimer International Growth R6 Fund, American Century Mid-Cap Value I Fund, Hartford SmallCap Growth Y Fund and Vanguard Federal Money Market Investor Fund.

 Benefits under the NQDC Plan may be distributed upon the earliest to occur of a separation from service (subject to a six month payment delay for certain specified employees under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code), the participant s death, a change in control or a specified date selected by the participant in accordance with the terms of the NQDC Plan. Benefits are distributed from the NQDC Plan in the form of a lump sum payment or, in certain circumstances if elected by the participant, in the form of annual installments for up to a five-year period. 
 
 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table 
 The NQDC Plan benefits for Mr. Cunningham were charged to us in 2022 pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement. The following table provides information regarding all contributions to, and the year-end balance of, the NQDC Plan account for Mr. Cunningham. Even though Messrs. Jennings, Harrison, Voliva and Ms. Bhatia were also participants in the NQDC Plan in 2022, we have not provided any disclosure with respect to their NQDC Plan benefits since those benefits were entirely paid for by HF Sinclair during 2022. Additional information regarding the NQDC Plan, and participation in the NQDC Plan by Messrs. Jennings and Voliva and Ms. Bhatia will be provided in HF Sinclair s 2023 Proxy Statement.

Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control 
 
 We had a Change in Control Agreement with Mr. Cunningham until his Retirement and we maintain the Long-Term Incentive Plan, which provides for potential severance compensation and/or accelerated vesting of equity compensation in the event of a termination of employment following a change in control or under other specified circumstances. However, as of December 31, 2022, none of our Named Executive Officers were eligible for benefits from us pursuant to a Change in Control Agreement, our Long-Term Incentive Plan, or the new Severance Pay Plan adopted in 2022. 
 
 Change in Control Agreements 
 
 HF Sinclair entered into a Change in Control Agreement with each of Messrs. Jennings, Voliva and Harrison and Ms. Bhatia. Mr. Voliva s HF Sinclair Change in Control Agreement terminated upon his separation on September 15, 2022. Payments and benefits under the HF Sinclair Change in Control Agreements are triggered only upon certain termination events in connection with a change in control of HF Sinclair. A summary of the terms of the HF Sinclair Change in Control Agreements, and a quantification of potential benefits under the HF Sinclair Change in Control Agreement with Mr. Jennings and Ms. Bhatia, will be disclosed in HF Sinclair s 2023 Proxy Statement. 
 
 We entered into a Change in Control Agreement with Mr. Cunningham, effective as of February 14, 2011, and his agreement terminated effective upon his retirement on February 18, 2022. We entered into a Change in Control Agreement with Mr. Voliva, effective as of April 28, 2014, and such agreement terminated on October 31, 2016 when he entered into a Change in Control Agreement with HF Sinclair. Therefore, as of February 18, 2022, there are no Change in Control Agreements that we currently maintain with a Named Executive Officer. 
 
 Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards 
 
 None of our Named Executive Officers have an outstanding long-term equity incentive award that was granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan. 
 
 Mutual Separation Agreement with Mr. Voliva 
 
 HLS and Mr. Voliva agreed to a mutual separation effective September 15, 2022 (the Separation Date ). As discussed above, Mr. Voliva was an HF Sinclair Shared Officer prior to his separation. In connection with Mr. Voliva s separation, HF Sinclair, HollyFrontier Corporation HFC ), HLS, HollyFrontier Payroll Services, Inc., and HEP, on behalf of themselves and their respective parents, subsidiaries and affiliates, and Mr. Voliva entered into a Mutual Separation Agreement and Release dated September 15, 2022 (the Separation Agreement ). The Separation Agreement set forth the terms of his separation compensation approved by the Board and included the following compensation paid to Mr. Voliva: (i) as a result of his provision of services to HEP and HLS during substantially all of the 2022 performance period ending on September 30, 2022, he received a 2022 annual incentive cash bonus of 600,000, which was 150 of his target bonus of 400,000 and was estimated to be at or near the expected actual payout for the 2022 performance period at the time of his separation, and (ii) pro rata vesting of his outstanding phantom unit award, resulting in the vesting of 14,956 phantom units granted to him in October 2020. 
 
 As a result of Mr. Voliva s prior position with HF Sinclair, the terms of the Separation Agreement included, and Mr. Voliva received from HF Sinclair, a separation payment equal to one year of salary of 715,000 to be paid in twelve monthly 
 - 145 - 

A 

 installments, a one-time cash payment of 100,000, a 2022 annual incentive cash bonus from HF Sinclair in the amount of 965,250, and pro rata vesting of his HF Sinclair equity awards, resulting in the vesting of 23,953 HF Sinclair restricted stock units and 48,971 HF Sinclair performance share units as of his Separation Date. 
 
 The foregoing severance and bonus payments are subject to Mr. Voliva not later revoking the Separation Agreement, which contains non-solicitation, non-compete, non-disparagement and confidentiality covenants from Mr. Voliva that were still in effect as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Retirement Consulting Arrangements with Mr. Cunningham 
 
 On October 27, 2021, Mr. Cunningham notified the Board that he was retiring from all officer positions and as an employee at HLS and its subsidiaries, effective February 18, 2022 (the Retirement Date ). In preparation for his Retirement, his responsibilities were transferred to four different individuals at HLS, effective January 1, 2022, rather than replacing his role with a single individual. Due to his expertise, history with HLS, involvement in current projects and the need to orderly transition his duties and knowledge to other individuals at HLS, Mr. Cunningham agreed to serve as a consultant to HLS and its subsidiaries for a twelve-month period following his Retirement Date. The terms of this consulting arrangement were included in a consulting agreement entered into between HLS and Mr. Cunningham on October 28, 2021, which became effective on February 19, 2022 (the Consulting Agreement ). The Consulting Agreement expired pursuant to its terms on February 19, 2023, but was still in effect on December 31, 2022. Pursuant to the Consulting Agreement, Mr. Cunningham received a payment of 50,000 per calendar month to provide up to 40 hours per month of services to HLS and its subsidiaries. The Consulting Agreement also included an obligation for Mr. Cunningham to keep information about HLS and its subsidiaries obtained during his time as a consultant confidential. During 2022, Mr. Cunningham received consulting fees from HLS pursuant to the Consulting Agreement in the aggregate amount of 517,857. 
 
 The outstanding equity awards that Mr. Cunningham held on his Retirement Date received accelerated vesting. A total of 2,092 of his phantom units and 10,889 of his performance units were accelerated, for an aggregate value of 229,634 as of his Retirement Date. His vested phantom unit and performance unit awards settled six months following his Retirement Date, as Mr. Cunningham was subject to certain executive officer level deferral requirements imposed by Section 409A of the Code. 
 
 Compensation Practices as They Relate To Risk Management 
 
 Although a significant portion of the compensation provided to the Named Executive Officers is performance-based, we believe our compensation programs do not encourage excessive and unnecessary risk taking by executive officers (or other employees) because these programs are designed to encourage employees to remain focused on both our short- and long-term operational and financial goals. 
 
 While annual cash-based incentive bonus awards play an appropriate role in the executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee believes that payment determined based on an evaluation of our performance on a variety of measures, including comparing our performance over the last year to our past performance, mitigates excessive risk-taking that could produce unsustainable gains in one area of performance at the expense of our overall long-term interests. In addition, we set performance goals that we believe are reasonable in light of our past performance and market conditions. 
 
 For Named Executive Officers performing all of their services for us, an appropriate part of total compensation is fixed, while another portion is variable and linked to performance. A portion of the variable compensation we provide is comprised of long-term incentives. A portion of the long-term incentives we provide is in the form of phantom units subject to time-based vesting conditions, which retains value even in a depressed market, so executives are less likely to take unreasonable risks. With respect to our performance units, payouts result in some compensation at levels below full target achievement, in lieu of an all or nothing approach. Further, our unit ownership guidelines require certain of our executives to hold at least a specified level of units (in addition to unvested and unsettled equity-based awards), which aligns an appropriate portion of their personal wealth to our long-term performance and the interests of our unitholders. 
 
 Also, our Clawback Policy requires the return of annual and long-term incentive compensation for: 
 
 the occurrence of a material financial restatement (other than due to a change in accounting policy or applicable law); 
 certain acts of dishonesty constituting a felony or serious misdemeanor and resulting or intending to result directly in gain or personal enrichment at the expense of HLS, HEP or any of its subsidiaries; 
 gross or willful and wanton negligence in the performance of material and substantial duties of employment with HLS, HEP and its subsidiaries; and 
 felony convictions involving moral turpitude. 
 - 146 - 

A 

Based on the foregoing and our annual review of our compensation programs, we do not believe that our compensation policies and practices are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us or our unitholders. 
 
 CEO Pay Ratio 
 
 The employees providing services to us are either provided by HLS, which utilizes people employed by HF Sinclair to perform services for us, or seconded to us by subsidiaries of HF Sinclair, as we do not have any employees for purposes of the pay ratio rules. Rather than providing a pay ratio disclosure that contemplates no employees, we have determined that the disclosure that would be most aligned with the spirit of the pay ratio rules and that would provide our unitholders with more meaningful information would be to provide a ratio using the median employee from the HF Sinclair employee population. As a result, we have used the same median employee that was identified by HF Sinclair following HF Sinclair s examination of the 2022 taxable wages for all individuals who were employed by HF Sinclair in the U.S. and Canada on December 15, 2022. 
 
 HF Sinclair identified the median employee by examining the 2022 taxable wages for all of its U.S. and Canadian employees, including its CEO, who were employed by HF Sinclair on December 15, 2022 . HF Sinclair included all U.S. and Canadian employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, temporary or seasonal basis. As of December 15, 2022, HF Sinclair employed 5,005 such persons. As permitted by the SEC rules, HF Sinclair excluded its 231 employees located in China, Germany, the Netherlands and the U.K. since those employees comprise less than 5 of HF Sinclair s 5,236 worldwide employees. HF Sinclair did not make any assumptions, adjustments or estimates with respect to the taxable wages other than deducting stock vesting from the taxable wages, and HF Sinclair did not annualize the wages for any employees that were not employed by HF Sinclair for all of 2022. HF Sinclair believes the use of taxable wages is the most appropriate compensation measure since it allows for a consistent measurement for employees in different countries . 
 
 After identifying the median employee based on total taxable wages, HF Sinclair calculated annual 2022 compensation for the median employee using the methodology provided in the SEC rules. HF Sinclair s median employee s annual 2022 compensation was as follows: 
 Name Year Salary Stock Awards Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation All Other Compensation Total Median Employee 2022 131,620 6,866 12,664 151,150 
 
 Our 2022 ratio of chief executive officer total compensation to the HF Sinclair median employee s total compensation is reasonably estimated to be 23:1.

 The following table sets forth as of February 15, 2023 the beneficial ownership of common units of HEP held by:

DISTRIBUTIONS AND PAYMENTS TO THE GENERAL PARTNER AND ITS AFFILIATES 
 
 The following table summarizes the distributions and payments to be made by us to our general partner and its affiliates in connection with the ongoing operation and liquidation of HEP. These distributions and payments were determined by and among affiliated entities and, consequently, are not the result of arm s-length negotiations. 
 
 Operational stage 
 Distributions of available cash to our general partner and its affiliates We currently distribute all of our available cash to unitholders of record on the applicable record date within 45 days after the end of each quarter, pro rata. 
 Payments to our general partner and its affiliates We pay HF Sinclair or its affiliates an administrative fee, currently 5.0 million per year, for the provision of various general and administrative services for our benefit. The administrative fee may increase if we make an acquisition that requires an increase in the level of general and administrative services that we receive from HF Sinclair or its affiliates. In connection with the HEP Transaction, we paid HF Sinclair a temporary monthly fee of 62,500 through November 30, 2022, relating to transition services provided to HEP by HF Sinclair. In addition, the general partner is entitled to reimbursement for all expenses it incurs on our behalf, including other general and administrative expenses. These reimbursable expenses include the salaries and the cost of employee benefits of employees of HF Sinclair who provide services to us on behalf of HLS. Finally, HLS is required to reimburse HF Sinclair for our benefit pursuant to the secondment arrangement for the wages, benefits, and other costs of HF Sinclair employees seconded to HLS to perform services at certain of our pipelines and tankage assets. Please read Omnibus Agreement and Secondment Arrangement below. Our general partner determines the amount of these expenses. 
 
 Liquidation stage 
 Liquidation Upon our liquidation, the partners, including our general partner, will be entitled to receive liquidating distributions according to their particular capital account balances. 
 
 OMNIBUS AGREEMENT

 our obligation to pay HF Sinclair an annual administrative fee, in the amount of 5.0 million for 2022, for the provision by HF Sinclair of certain general and administrative services; 
 - 150 - 

A 

 HF Sinclair's and its affiliates agreement not to compete with us under certain circumstances and our right to notice of, and right of first offer to purchase, certain logistics assets constructed by HF Sinclair and acquired as part of an acquisition by HF Sinclair of refining assets; 
 an indemnity by HF Sinclair for certain potential environmental liabilities; 
 our obligation to indemnify HF Sinclair for environmental liabilities related to our assets existing on the date of our initial public offering to the extent HF Sinclair is not required to indemnify us; 
 HF Sinclair s right of first refusal to purchase our assets that serve HF Sinclair s refineries; and 
 our obligation to pay HF Sinclair a temporary administrative services fee, in the amount of 62,500 per month, related to certain transition services in connection with the HEP Transaction. 
 
 Payment of general and administrative services fee and temporary monthly fee 
 Under the Omnibus Agreement, we pay HF Sinclair an annual administrative fee, in the amount of 5.0 million for 2022, for the provision of various general and administrative services for our benefit. This fee is subject to annual adjustment for changes in the Producer Price Index Commodities - Finished Goods, et al. Our general partner may agree to further increases in connection with expansions of our operations through the acquisition or construction of new assets or businesses. 
 
 The administrative fee includes expenses incurred by HF Sinclair and its affiliates to perform centralized corporate functions, such as legal, accounting, treasury, information technology and other corporate services, including the administration of employee benefit plans. In connection with the HEP Transaction, we paid HF Sinclair a temporary monthly fee of 62,500 through November 30, 2022, relating to transition services provided to HEP by HF Sinclair. Neither the annual administrative fee nor the temporary monthly fee includes salaries of pipeline and terminal personnel or other employees of HF Sinclair who perform services for us on behalf of HLS or the cost of their employee benefits, such as 401(k), pension, and health insurance benefits, which are separately charged to us by HF Sinclair. We also reimburse HF Sinclair and its affiliates for direct general and administrative expenses they incur on our behalf. 
 
 Noncompetition 
 HF Sinclair and its affiliates have agreed, for so long as HF Sinclair controls our general partner, not to engage in, whether by acquisition or otherwise, the business of operating crude oil pipelines or terminals, refined product pipelines or terminals, intermediate pipelines or terminals, truck racks or crude oil gathering systems in the continental United States. This restriction will not apply to: 
 
 any business operated by HF Sinclair or any of its affiliates at the time of the closing of our initial public offering; 
 any business conducted by HF Sinclair with the approval of our general partner; 
 any business or asset that HF Sinclair or any of its affiliates acquires or constructs that has a fair market value or construction cost of less than 5 million; and 
 any business or asset that HF Sinclair or any of its affiliates acquires or constructs that has a fair market value or construction cost of 5 million or more if we have been offered the opportunity to purchase the business or asset at fair market value, and we decline to do so. 
 
 The limitations on the ability of HF Sinclair and its affiliates to compete with us will terminate if HF Sinclair ceases to control our general partner. 
 
 Indemnification 
 Under the Omnibus Agreement, certain transportation agreements and purchase agreements with HF Sinclair, HF Sinclair has agreed to indemnify us, subject to certain limitations, for environmental noncompliance and remediation liabilities associated with certain assets transferred to us from HF Sinclair and occurring or existing prior to the date of such transfers. The Omnibus Agreement provides environmental indemnification with respect to certain transferred assets of up to 7.5 million through 2023 and 15 million through 2026. HF Sinclair's indemnification obligations under the Omnibus Agreement do not apply to assets we acquire from third parties, assets we construct or assets we relocate after they are transferred to us from HF Sinclair. For the Tulsa loading racks acquired from HF Sinclair in August 2009 and the Tulsa logistics and storage assets acquired from Sinclair in December 2009, HF Sinclair agreed to indemnify us for environmental liabilities arising from our pre-ownership operations of these assets. Additionally, HF Sinclair agreed to indemnify us for any liabilities arising from its operation of our loading racks located at HFC's Tulsa refinery west facility. 
 
 We have indemnified HF Sinclair and its affiliates against environmental liabilities related to events that occur on our assets after the date we acquired such asset. 
 
 - 151 - 

A 

 Right of first refusal to purchase our assets 
 The Omnibus Agreement also contains the terms under which HF Sinclair has a right of first refusal to purchase our assets that serve its refineries. Before we enter into any contract to sell pipeline and terminal assets serving HF Sinclair s refineries, we must give written notice of the terms of such proposed sale to HF Sinclair. The notice must set forth the name of the third-party purchaser, the assets to be sold, the purchase price, all details of the payment terms and all other terms and conditions of the offer. To the extent the third-party offer consists of consideration other than cash (or in addition to cash), the purchase price shall be deemed equal to the amount of any such cash plus the fair market value of such non-cash consideration, determined as set forth in the Omnibus Agreement. HF Sinclair will then have the sole and exclusive option for a period of thirty days following receipt of the notice, to purchase the subject assets on the terms specified in the notice. 
 
 SECONDMENT ARRANGEMENT 
 
 Under HLS s secondment arrangement with HF Sinclair, certain employees of HF Sinclair are seconded to HLS, our general partner s general partner, to provide operational and maintenance services with respect to certain of our pipelines, terminals and refinery processing units, including routine operational and maintenance activities. During their period of secondment, the seconded employees are under the management and supervision of HLS. HLS is required to reimburse HF Sinclair for our benefit for the cost of the seconded employees, including their wages and benefits, based on the percentage of the employee s time spent working for HLS. The secondment arrangement continues until HLS s mutual agreement with HF Sinclair to terminate. 
 
 PIPELINE AND TERMINAL, TANKAGE AND THROUGHPUT AGREEMENTS 
 
 We serve HF Sinclair s refineries and renewable diesel facilities under long-term pipeline, terminal, tankage and refinery processing unit throughput agreements expiring in 2023 to 2036. Under these agreements, HF Sinclair agrees to transport, store and process throughput volumes of refined product, crude oil and feedstocks on our pipelines, terminal, tankage and loading rack facilities and refinery processing units that result in minimum annual payments to us. These minimum annual payments or revenues are subject to annual tariff rate adjustments on July 1st each year, based on the PPI or the FERC index. As of December 31, 2022, these agreements with HF Sinclair require minimum annualized payments to us of 452.6 million. In connection with the Sinclair Transactions, we amended our master throughput agreement with HF Sinclair to add Sinclair Oil as a shipper and encompass the acquired Sinclair Assets (as defined therein), and we amended our master lease and access agreement with HF Sinclair to, among other things, include certain Sinclair assets in the list of assets comprising the Applicable Assets (as defined therein). 
 
 HF Sinclair s obligations under these agreements will not terminate if HF Sinclair and its affiliates no longer own the general partner. These agreements may be assigned by HF Sinclair only with the consent of our conflicts committee.

 4.1 Participant Deferral Credits. To the extent provided in the Adoption Agreement, each Active Participant may elect, by entering into a Participation Agreement with the Employer, to defer the receipt of Compensation from the Employer by a dollar amount or percentage specified in the Participation Agreement. The amount of 
 10 

Compensation the Participant elects to defer, the Participant Deferral Credit, shall be credited by the Employer to the Deferred Compensation Account maintained for the Participant pursuant to Section 8. The following special provisions shall apply with respect to the Participant Deferral Credits of a Participant 
 4.1.1 The Employer shall credit to the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account on each Crediting Date an amount equal to the total Participant Deferral Credit for the period ending on such Crediting Date. 
 
 4.1.2 An election pursuant to this Section 4.1 shall be made by the Participant by executing and delivering a Participation Agreement to the Committee. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.1, the Participation Agreement shall become effective with respect to such Participant as of the first day of January following the date such Participation Agreement is received by the Committee. A Participant's election may be changed at any time prior to the last permissible date for making the election as permitted in this Section 4.1, and shall thereafter be irrevocable. Any election of a Participant shall continue in effect for the time period as set forth in the Adoption Agreement and shall be described as evergreen or non-evergreen as appropriate. 
 
 4.1.3 A Participant may execute and deliver a Participation Agreement to the Committee within 30 days after the date the Participant first becomes eligible to participate in the Plan. After the 30 day period expires, or after any shorter time period as agreed to by the Participant and the Committee, the latest election made by the Participant during that period becomes irrevocable. Such election shall then be effective as of the first payroll period commencing following the date the Participation Agreement becomes irrevocable. Whether a Participant is treated as newly eligible for participation under this Section shall be determined in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder, including (i) rules that treat all elective deferral account balance plans as one plan, and (ii) rules that treat a previously eligible Employee as newly eligible if his benefits had been previously distributed or if he has been ineligible for 24 months. For Compensation that is earned based upon a specified performance period (for example, an annual bonus), where a deferral election is made under this Section but after the beginning of the performance period, the election will only apply to the portion of the Compensation equal to the total amount of the Compensation for the service period multiplied by the ratio of the number of days remaining in the performance period after the date the election becomes irrevocable over the total number of days in the performance period. 
 
 4.1.4 A Participant may unilaterally modify a Participation Agreement (either to terminate, increase or decrease the portion of his future Compensation which is subject to deferral within the percentage limits set forth in Section 4.1 of 
 11 

the Adoption Agreement) by providing a written modification of the Participation Agreement to the Committee. The modification shall become effective as of the first day of January following the date such written modification is received by the Committee, or at such later date as required under Section 409A of the Code. 
 
 4.1.5 If the Participant performed services continuously from the later of the beginning of the performance period or the date upon which the performance criteria are established through the date upon which the Participant makes an initial deferral election, a Participation Agreement relating to the deferral of Performance- Based Compensation may be executed and delivered to the Committee no later than the date which is 6 months prior to the end of the performance period, provided that in no event may an election to defer Performance-Based Compensation be made after such Compensation has become readily ascertainable. 
 
 4.1.6 If the Employer has a fiscal year other than the calendar year, Compensation relating to Service in the fiscal year of the Employer (such as a bonus based on the fiscal year of the Employer), of which no amount is paid or payable during the fiscal year, may be deferred at the Participant's election if the election to defer is made not later than the close of the Employer's fiscal year next preceding the first fiscal year in which the Participant performs any services for which such Compensation is payable. 
 
 4.1.7 Compensation payable after the last day of the Participant's taxable year solely for services provided during the final payroll period containing the last day of the Participant's taxable year (i.e., December 31) is treated for purposes of this Section 4.1 as Compensation for services performed in the subsequent taxable year. 
 
 4.1.8 The Committee may from time to time establish policies or rules consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code to govern the manner in which Participant Deferral Credits may be made. 
 
 4.1.9 If a Participant becomes Disabled all currently effective deferral elections for such Participant shall be cancelled. At the time the participant is no longer Disabled, subsequent elections to defer future compensation will be permitted under this Section 4. 
 
 4.1.10 If a Participant applies for and receives a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency, all currently effective deferral elections for such Participant shall be cancelled. Subsequent elections to defer future compensation will be permitted under this Section 4. 
 
 4.1.11 If a Participant receives a hardship distribution from a 401(k) or a 
 403(b) plan that requires all currently effective deferral elections under all plans maintained by the Employer to be cancelled, then all currently effective deferral elections shall be cancelled until the later of the beginning of the next calendar year 
 10 

or six months after the date of the hardship distribution. Subsequent elections to defer future compensation under this Section 4 will not be effective until the later of the beginning of the next calendar year or six months after the date of the hardship distribution. If the effective date of such an election occurs after the beginning of the next calendar year, as permitted by the Employer, a Participant may make elections for the next calendar year prior to January 1 st of the next calendar year, but these elections will not become effective until the end of the six- month waiting period. 
 
 4.2 Employer Credits. If designated by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement, the Employer shall cause the Committee to credit to the Deferred Compensation Account of each Active Participant an Employer Credit as determined in accordance with the Adoption Agreement. A Participant must make distribution elections with respect to any Employer Credits credited to his Deferred Compensation Account by the deadline that would apply under Section 4.1 for distribution elections with respect to Participant Deferral Credits credited at the same time, on a Participation Agreement that is timely executed and delivered to the Committee pursuant to Section 4.1. If no distribution election is made, vested amounts in the Deferred Compensation Account will be distributed in a lump sum upon the earliest of any Qualifying Distribution Event limited to Separation from Service, Disability, Death or Change in Control. 
 4.3 Deferred Compensation Account. All Participant Deferral Credits and Employer Credits shall be credited to the Deferred Compensation Account of the Participant as provided in Section 8. 
 Section 5. Qualifying Distribution Events 
 
 5.1 Separation from Service. If the Participant Separates from Service with the Employer, the vested balance in the Deferred Compensation Account shall be paid to the Participant by the Employer as provided in Section 7. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no distribution shall be made earlier than six months after the date of Separation from 
 11 

Service (or, if earlier, the date of death) with respect to a Participant who as of the date of Separation from Service is a Specified Employee of a corporation the stock in which is traded on an established securities market or otherwise. Any payments to which such Specified Employee would be entitled during the first six months following the date of Separation from Service shall be accumulated and paid on the first day of the seventh month following the date of Separation from Service, and shall be adjusted for deemed investment gain and loss incurred during the six month period. 
 5.2 Disability. If the Employer designates in the Adoption Agreement that distributions are permitted under the Plan when a Participant becomes Disabled, and the Participant becomes Disabled while in Service, the vested balance in the Deferred Compensation Account shall be paid to the Participant by the Employer as provided in Section 7. 
 5.3 Death. If the Participant dies while in Service, the Employer shall pay a benefit to the Participant's Beneficiary in the amount designated in the Adoption Agreement. Payment of such benefit shall be made by the Employer as provided in Section 
 7. 
 
 5.4 In-Service or Education Distributions. If the Employer designates in the Adoption Agreement that in-service or education distributions are permitted under the Plan, a Participant may designate in the Participation Agreement to have a specified amount credited to the Participant's In-Service or Education Account for in-service or education distributions at the date specified by the Participant. In no event may an in- service or education distribution of an amount be made before the date that is two years 
 12 

after the first day of the year in which any deferral election to such In-Service or Education 
 13 

Account became effective. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Participant incurs a Qualifying Distribution Event prior to the date on which the entire balance in the In-Service or Education Account has been distributed, then the vested balance in the In-Service or Education Account on the date of the Qualifying Distribution Event shall be paid as provided under Section 7.1 for payments on such Qualifying Distribution Event. 
 5.5 Change in Control Event. If the Employer designates in the Adoption Agreement that distributions are permitted under the Plan upon the occurrence of a Change in Control Event, the Participant may designate in the Participation Agreement to have the vested balance in the Deferred Compensation Account paid to the Participant upon a Change in Control Event by the Employer as provided in Section 7. 
 5.6 Unforeseeable Emergency. If the Employer designates in the Adoption Agreement that distributions are permitted under the Plan upon the occurrence of an Unforeseeable Emergency event, a distribution from the Deferred Compensation Account may be made to a Participant in the event of an Unforeseeable Emergency, subject to the following provisions 
 5.6.1 A Participant may, at any time prior to his Separation from Service for any reason, make application to the Committee to receive a distribution in a lump sum of all or a portion of the vested balance in the Deferred Compensation Account (determined as of the date the distribution, if any, is made under this Section 5.6) because of an Unforeseeable Emergency. A distribution because of an Unforeseeable Emergency shall not exceed the amount required to satisfy the Unforeseeable Emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of such distribution, after taking into account the extent to which the Unforeseeable Emergency may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant's assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship) or by stopping current deferrals under the Plan pursuant to Section 4.1.10. 
 
 5.6.2 The Participant's request for a distribution on account of Unforeseeable Emergency must be made in writing to the Committee. The request must specify the nature of the financial hardship, the total amount requested to be 
 14 

distributed from the Deferred Compensation Account, and the total amount of the actual expense incurred or to be incurred on account of the Unforeseeable Emergency. 
 
 5.6.3 If a distribution under this Section 5.6 is approved by the Committee, such distribution will be made as soon as practicable following the date it is approved. The processing of the request shall be completed as soon as practicable from the date on which the Committee receives the properly completed written request for a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency. If a Participant's Separation from Service occurs after a request is approved in accordance with this Section 5.6.3, but prior to distribution of the full amount approved, the approval of the request shall be automatically null and void and the benefits which the Participant is entitled to receive under the Plan shall be distributed in accordance with the applicable distribution provisions of the Plan. 
 
 5.6.4 The Committee may from time to time adopt additional policies or rules consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code to govern the manner in which such distributions may be made so that the Plan may be conveniently administered. 
 
 Section 6. Vesting 
 
 A Participant shall be fully vested in the portion of his Deferred Compensation Account attributable to Participant Deferral Credits, and all income, gains and losses attributable thereto. A Participant shall become fully vested in the portion of his Deferred Compensation Account attributable to Employer Credits, and income, gains and losses attributable thereto, in accordance with the vesting schedule and provisions designated by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement. If a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account is not fully vested upon Separation from Service, the portion of the Deferred Compensation Account that is not fully vested shall thereupon be forfeited. 
 Section 7. Distribution Rules 
 
 7.1 Payment Options. The Employer shall designate in the Adoption Agreement the payment options which may be elected by the Participant (lump sum, annual installments, or a combination of both). Different payment options may be made available 
 15 

for each Qualifying Distribution Event, and different payment options may be available for different types of Separations from Service, all as designated in the Adoption Agreement. The Participant shall elect in the Participation Agreement the method under which the vested balance in the Deferred Compensation Account will be distributed from among the designated payment options. The Participant may at such time elect a different method of payment for each Qualifying Distribution Event as specified in the Adoption Agreement. If the Participant is permitted by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement to elect different payment options and does not make a valid election, the vested balance in the Deferred Compensation Account will be distributed as a lump sum upon the Qualifying Distribution Event. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if certain Qualifying Distribution Events occur prior to the date on which the vested balance of a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account is completely paid pursuant to this Section 7.1 following the occurrence of certain Qualifying Distribution Events, the following rules apply 
 7.1.1 If the currently effective Qualifying Distribution Event is a Separation from Service or Disability, and the Participant subsequently dies, the remaining unpaid vested balance of a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account shall be paid as a lump sum. 
 
 7.1.2 If the currently effective Qualifying Distribution Event is a Change in Control Event, and any subsequent Qualifying Distribution Event occurs (except an In-Service or Education Distribution described in Section 2.29(iv)), the remaining unpaid vested balance of a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account shall be paid as provided under Section 7.1 for payments on such subsequent Qualifying Distribution Event. 
 
 7.2 Timing of Payments. Payment shall be made in the manner elected by the Participant and shall commence as soon as practicable after (but no later than 60 days after) the distribution date specified for the Qualifying Distribution Event. For each payment, the 
 16 

Committee must specify a date for the Deferred Compensation Account(s) to be valued. In the event the Participant fails to make a valid election of the payment method, the distribution will be made in a single lump sum payment as soon as practicable after (but no later than 60 days after) the Qualifying Distribution Event. A payment may be further delayed to the extent permitted in accordance with regulations and guidance under Section 
 409A of the Code. 
 
 7.3 Installment Payments. If the Participant elects to receive installment payments upon a Qualifying Distribution Event, the payment of each installment shall be made on the anniversary of the date of the first installment payment, and the amount of the installment shall be adjusted on such anniversary for credits or debits to the Participant's account pursuant to Section 8 of the Plan. Such adjustment shall be made by dividing the balance in the Deferred Compensation Account on such date by the number of installments remaining to be paid hereunder provided that the last installment due under the Plan shall be the entire amount credited to the Participant's account on the date of payment. 
 7.4 De Minimis Amounts. Notwithstanding any payment election made by the Participant, if the Employer designates a pre-determined de minimis amount in the Adoption Agreement, the vested balance in all Deferred Compensation Accounts of the Participant will be distributed in a single lump sum payment if at the time of a permitted Qualifying Distribution Event the vested balance does not exceed such pre-determined de minimis amount provided, however, that such distribution will be made only where the Qualifying Distribution Event is a Separation from Service, death, Disability (if applicable) or Change in Control Event (if applicable). Such payment shall be made on or 
 17 

before the later of (i) December 31 of the calendar year in which the Qualifying Distribution Event 
 18 

occurs, or (ii) the date that is 2-1 2 months after the Qualifying Distribution Event occurs. In addition, the Employer may distribute a Participant's vested balance in all of the Participant s Deferred Compensation Accounts at any time if the balance does not exceed the limit in Section 402(g)(1)(B) of the Code and results in the termination of the Participant's entire interest in the Plan as provided under Section 409A of the Code. 
 7.5 Subsequent Elections. With the consent of the Committee, a Participant may delay or change the method of payment of the Deferred Compensation Account subject to the following requirements 
 7.5.1 The new election may not take effect until at least 12 months after the date on which the new election is made. 
 
 7.5.2 If the new election relates to a payment for a Qualifying Distribution Event other than the death of the Participant, the Participant becoming Disabled, or an Unforeseeable Emergency, the new election must provide for the deferral of the payment for a period of at least five years from the date such payment would otherwise have been made. 
 
 7.5.3 If the new election relates to a payment from the In-Service or Education Account, the new election must be made at least 12 months prior to the date of the first scheduled payment from such account. 
 
 For purposes of this Section 7.5 and Section 7.6, a payment is each separately identified amount to which the Participant is entitled under the Plan provided, that entitlement to a series of installment payments is treated as the entitlement to a single payment. 
 7.6 Acceleration Prohibited. The acceleration of the time or schedule of any payment due under the Plan is prohibited except as expressly provided in regulations and administrative guidance promulgated under Section 409A of the Code (such as accelerations for domestic relations orders and employment taxes). It is not an acceleration of the time or schedule of payment if the Employer waives or accelerates the vesting requirements applicable to a benefit under the Plan. 
 19 

7.7 Residual Distributions. If calculation of the amount of any credit to a Participant s Deferred Compensation Account is not administratively practicable due to events beyond the control of the Employer, payments may be made to the Participant for residual amounts contributed to or remaining in a Deferred Compensation Account after payments under the provisions of this Section 7 have commenced or been completed. The residual amount shall be credited to the Deferred Compensation Account when the calculation of the amount becomes administratively practicable. Examples of residual amounts include, but are not limited to, additional investment returns credited after payment (due to dividends or pricing changes) or additional contributions made after payment (such as an annual bonus deferral or an Employer Credit). Payments that would have been made had the residual amount been calculable at the benefit commencement date shall be made up as soon as practicable after crediting to the Deferred Compensation Account, in no case later than the end of the year in which calculation of the amount becomes administratively practicable. 
 7.8 Ineffective Deferrals. If a Participant deferral election under Section 4 to contribute to an In-Service or Education Account carries over to a subsequent year (an evergreen election) and the deferral election is ineffective (i.e., the distribution election would cause payment in the current or prior years), the amount deferred will be credited to a Deferred Compensation Account that is not an In-Service or Education Account. If the Participant only has one account of this type, the amount deferred will be credited to that account. If the Participant has multiple accounts of this type, and one of the accounts has a lump sum at Separation from Service distribution election, the amount deferred will be credited to that account. If the Participant has multiple accounts of this type and does not 
 20 

have an account with a lump sum at Separation from Service distribution election, one will be established with a lump sum at Separation from Service distribution election and the amount deferred will be credited to this account. 
 Section 8. Accounts Deemed Investment Adjustments to Account 
 
 8.1 Accounts. The Committee shall establish a book reserve account, entitled the Deferred Compensation Account, on behalf of each Participant. The Committee shall also establish an In-Service or Education Account as a part of the Deferred Compensation Account of each Participant, if applicable. The amount credited to the Deferred Compensation Account shall be adjusted pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.3. 
 8.2 Deemed Investments. The Deferred Compensation Account of a Participant shall be credited with an investment return determined as if the account were invested in one or more investment funds made available by the Committee. The Participant shall elect the investment funds in which his Deferred Compensation Account shall be deemed to be invested. Such election shall be made in the manner prescribed by the Committee and shall take effect upon the entry of the Participant into the Plan. The investment election of the Participant shall remain in effect until a new election is made by the Participant. In the event the Participant fails for any reason to make an effective election of the investment return to be credited to his account, the investment return shall be determined by the Committee. 
 8.3 Adjustments to Deferred Compensation Account. With respect to each Participant who has a Deferred Compensation Account under the Plan, the amount credited to such account shall be adjusted by the following debits and credits, at the times and in the order stated 
 21 

8.3.1 The Deferred Compensation Account shall be debited each business day with the total amount of any payments made from such account since the last preceding business day to him or for his benefit. Unless otherwise specified by the Employer, each deemed investment fund will be debited pro-rata based on the value of the investment funds as of the end of the preceding business day. 
 
 8.3.2 The Deferred Compensation Account shall be credited on each Crediting Date with the total amount of any Participant Deferral Credits and Employer Credits to such account since the last preceding Crediting Date. 
 
 8.3.3 The Deferred Compensation Account shall be credited or debited on each day securities are traded on a national stock exchange with the amount of deemed investment gain or loss resulting from the performance of the deemed investment funds elected by the Participant in accordance with Section 8.2. The amount of such deemed investment gain or loss shall be determined by the Committee and such determination shall be final and conclusive upon all concerned. 
 
 Section 9. Administration by Committee 
 
 9.1 Membership of Committee. If the Committee consists of individuals appointed by the Board, they will serve at the pleasure of the Board. Any member of the Committee may resign, and his successor, if any, shall be appointed by the Board.

The Committee shall have the full authority and discretion to make, amend, interpret, and enforce all appropriate rules and regulations for the administration of this Plan and decide or resolve any and all questions, including interpretations of this Plan, as may arise in connection with this Plan. Any such action taken by the Committee shall be final and conclusive on any party. To the extent the Committee has been granted discretionary authority under the Plan, the Committee s prior exercise of such authority shall not obligate it to exercise its authority in a like fashion thereafter. The Committee shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon all tables, valuations, certificates, opinions and reports furnished by any actuary, 
 20 

accountant, controller, counsel or other person employed or engaged by the Employer with respect to the Plan. The Committee may, from time to time, employ agents and delegate to such agents, including Employees of the Employer, such administrative or other duties as it sees fit. 
 9.3 Indemnification. To the extent not covered by insurance, the Employer shall indemnify the Committee, each Employee, officer, director, and agent of the Employer, and all persons formerly serving in such capacities, against any and all liabilities or expenses, including all legal fees relating thereto, arising in connection with the exercise of their duties and responsibilities with respect to the Plan, provided however that the Employer shall not indemnify any person for liabilities or expenses due to that person s own gross negligence or willful misconduct. 
 Section 10. Contractual Liability, Trust 
 
 10.1 Contractual Liability. Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, the Company shall be obligated to make all payments hereunder. This obligation shall constitute a contractual liability of the Company to the Participants, and such payments shall be made from the general funds of the Company. The Company shall not be required to establish or maintain any special or separate fund, or otherwise to segregate assets to assure that such payments shall be made, and the Participants shall not have any interest in any particular assets of the Company by reason of its obligations hereunder. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payment from the Company under the Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured creditor of the Company. 
 21 

10.2 Trust. The Employer may establish a trust to assist it in meeting its obligations under the Plan. Any such trust shall conform to the requirements of a grantor trust under Revenue Procedures 92-64 and 92-65 and at all times during the continuance of the trust the principal and income of the trust shall be subject to claims of general creditors of the Employer under federal and state law. The establishment of such a trust would not be intended to cause Participants to realize current income on amounts contributed thereto, and the trust would be so interpreted and administered.

Any Beneficiary may disclaim all or any part of any benefit to which such Beneficiary shall be entitled hereunder by filing a written disclaimer with the Committee before payment of such benefit is to be made. Such a disclaimer shall be made in a form satisfactory to the Committee and shall be irrevocable when filed.

 16.6.15 The second appeals review committee will make a determination on the second claim appeal within 45 days of the receipt of the appeal request. This period may be extended for an additional 45 days if the committee determines that special circumstances require an extension of time. A written notice of the extension, the reason for the extension and the date that the committee expects to render a decision will be furnished to the Participant or Beneficiary within the initial 
 45-day period. However, if the period of time is extended due to the Participant s or Beneficiary s failure to submit information necessary to decide the appeal, the period for making the benefit determination will be tolled from the date on which the notification of the extension is sent until the date on which the Participant or Beneficiary responds to the request for additional information. 
 
 16.6.16 If the claim on appeal is denied in whole or in part for a second time, the Participant or Beneficiary will receive a written notification of the denial. The notice will follow the rules of 29 C.F.R. 2560.503-1(o) for culturally and linguistically appropriate notices and will be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the applicant. The notice will include the same information that was included in the first adverse determination letter and will identify the contractual limitations period that applies to the Participant s or Beneficiary s right to bring an action under section 502(a) of ERISA including the calendar date on which the contractual limitations period expires for the claim. 
 
 16.6.17 A claimant may not commence a judicial proceeding against any person, including the Committee, the Employer, the Board, the first or second appeals review committee(s), or any other person or committee, with respect to a claim for benefits without first exhausting the claims procedures set forth in the preceding paragraphs. No suit or legal action contesting in whole or in part any denial of benefits under the Plan shall be commenced later than the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of (A) the date of the notice of the Committee s final decision on appeal, or (B) if the claimant fails to request any level of administrative review within the timeframe permitted under this Section 16.6, the deadline for requesting the next level of administrative review, and (ii) the last date on which such legal action could be commenced under the applicable statute of limitations under ERISA (including, for this purpose, any applicable state statute of limitations that applies under ERISA to such legal action).
