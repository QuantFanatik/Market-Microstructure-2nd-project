 Edison International s earnings are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses core earnings (losses) internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Core earnings (losses) are also used when communicating with investors and analysts regarding Edison International s earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the company s performance from period to period. Core earnings (losses) are a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings (losses) are defined as earnings attributable to Edison International shareholders less non-core items. Non-core items include income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, such as write downs, asset impairments and other income and expense related to changes in law, outcomes in tax, regulatory or legal proceedings, and exit activities, including sale of certain assets and other activities that are no longer continuing. Edison International s 2022 earnings decreased 147 million, driven by an increase in Edison International Parent and Other losses of 165 million, offset by an increase in SCE s earnings of 18 million. Edison International Parent and Other higher losses consisted of 103 million of lower non-core earnings and 62 million of higher core losses. SCE s higher net income consisted of 86 million of higher core earnings, offset by 68 million of higher non-core losses. The increase in SCE s core earnings was primarily due to higher revenue due to the escalation mechanism as set forth in the 2021 GRC final decision and higher return on rate base from capital balancing accounts, partially offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses, higher depreciation from increased plant balance and higher interest expense. The increase in Edison International Parent and Other s core losses was primarily due to higher preferred dividends. Consolidated non-core items for 2022 and 2021 for Edison International included: Charges of 1.2 billion 899 million after-tax) recorded in 2022 and 1.2 billion 919 million after-tax) recorded in 2021 for 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events claims and expenses, net of expected recoveries from FERC customers.

 See Results of Operations for discussion of SCE and Edison International Parent and Other results of operations. Electricity Industry Trends The electric power industry is undergoing transformative change driven by federal and state government actions to reduce GHG emissions, as well as technological advances, such as customer-owned generation, electric vehicles and energy storage. These factors are altering the way in which electricity is generated and delivered as well as the regulatory and business environment for the industry. California is committed to reducing its GHG emissions, improving local air quality and supporting continued economic growth. The state codified into law goals to reduce GHG emissions by 40 from 1990 levels by 2030 and 85 from the same baseline by 2045, as well as to be carbon neutral by 2045. State and local air quality plans also call for substantial improvements. In the most polluted areas of the state this includes reducing smog-causing nitrogen oxides 90 below 2010 levels by 2032. While these policy goals cannot be achieved by the electric sector alone, the electric grid is a critical enabler of the adoption of energy technologies that support California s climate change and GHG reduction objectives. California has set RPS targets which require California retail sellers of electricity to provide 60 of power from renewable resources by 2030. California also requires sellers of electricity to deliver 100 of retail sales from carbon-free sources by 2045, including interim targets of 90 by 2035 and 95 by 2040. In 2022, approximately 48 of SCE s customer deliveries came from carbon-free resources. SCE remains well-positioned to meet its long-term RPS and carbon-free power goals and interim targets. In addition, Edison International is committed to achieving net-zero GHG emissions by 2045, in alignment with economy-wide climate actions planned by California. This commitment covers the power SCE delivers to customers and Edison International s enterprise-wide operations. The current federal administration has also responded to climate change through numerous regulatory and Executive Order actions including for the development of more robust fuel efficiency and vehicle emission standards. Many of these actions align with internal company goals and efforts to address and mitigate climate change. Additionally, building upon the historic infrastructure legislation of 2021, Congress passed the IRA in 2022 that provides significant new funding to electrify the economy. Edison International believes these actions complement its industry-leading efforts to equitably transition to a decarbonized economy. Edison International believes that California s 2045 goals can be achieved most economically through emissions reductions from using clean electricity to serve 100 of retail sales, electrifying approximately 76 of light-duty vehicles, 67 of medium-duty vehicles, 38 of heavy-duty vehicles, 85 of buses and 70 of buildings and using low-carbon fuels for technologies that are not yet viable for electrification. California has demonstrated strong long-term support of transportation electrification as shown by the approval of SCE s Charge Ready programs and 2022 legislation

 banning sales of new gas vehicles by 2035. However, SCE believes that more state policy support, along with public and private investment, is needed to enable California to reach its 2030 GHG reduction targets. To support these goals, Edison International s vision is to lead the transformation of the electric power industry and the company is focused on opportunities in delivering clean energy, advancing electrification, building a modernized and more reliable grid, and enabling customers technology choices. SCE is focused on accelerating clean power and electrification, strengthening and modernizing the grid, achieving operational and service excellence and proactively mitigating climate change-related risks, including wildfires. SCE s ongoing focus to drive operational and service excellence is intended to allow it to achieve these objectives safely while controlling costs and customer rates. SCE projects that, even as electricity bills increase over time, due to higher efficiency of electrified end-use technologies, decarbonization and electrification will reduce energy consumption costs for the average family by one-third by 2045. SCE s focus on the transmission and distribution of electricity aligns with California s policy supporting competitive power procurement markets. SCE is undertaking projects and programs to accelerate economy-wide electrification. To support system reliability, SCE is investing 1.0 billion in utility owned storage capacity as well as contracting for substantial new clean energy resources. See Capital Program and Business SCE Purchased Power and Fuel Supply CAISO Wholesale Energy Market for further details. SCE also continues to implement its transportation electrification programs. As of December 31, 2022, SCE had completed construction at 179 sites to support 3,048 charge ports under its suite of light duty Charge Ready Programs, and 42 sites to support the electrification of 895 medium and heavy-duty vehicles through its Charge Ready Transport program. Changes in the electric power industry are impacting customers and jurisdictions outside California as well. Many other states and countries are also pursuing climate change and GHG reduction objectives and large commercial and industrial customers are continuing to pursue cost reduction and sustainability goals. Edison Energy provides decarbonization and energy solutions to commercial, institutional and industrial customers in North America and Europe who may be impacted by these changes. To better engage in this broader transformation and provide a view of developments outside of SCE, Edison International has made several investments in emerging companies in areas related to the technology and business model changes that are driving industry transformation and may make additional investments in the future. These investments are not financially material to Edison International. 2025 General Rate Case SCE expects to file its 2025 GRC application with the CPUC in May 2023, for the four-year period of 2025 2028. In its 2025 GRC, SCE will seek necessary funding for various grid planning and development activities to support California s clean energy transformation and economy-wide decarbonization objectives, while continuing to prioritize wildfire mitigation programs in high fire risk areas, focus on increased system reliability, technology enabled grid investments and provide safe, reliable, and affordable service to customers.

 Cost of Capital Applications In 2021, SCE filed an application with the CPUC for authority to establish its authorized cost of capital for utility operations for 2022 and to reset the related annual cost of capital mechanism that can adjust the authorized cost of capital between SCE s cost of capital proceedings based on changes in Moody s utility bond rate index. In November 2022, the CPUC issued a decision maintaining SCE s cost of capital at pre-2022 levels for 2022 and closing the proceedings. In December 2022, intervenors filed an application for rehearing of the decision; if the CPUC takes further action it may impact revenues collected in rates during 2022. In April 2022, SCE filed an application with the CPUC for authority to establish its authorized cost of capital for utility operations for a three-year term beginning in 2023 and to reset the related annual cost of capital adjustment mechanism (see Business SCE Overview of Ratemaking Process for further information on the adjustment mechanism). In December 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision that set SCE s ROE at 10.05 , and maintained SCE s current authorized capital structure, after CPUC-allowed exclusions, of 52 common equity, 43 long-term debt, and 5 preferred equity. Under the final decision, SCE s 2023 authorized cost of long-term debt and preferred equity are 4.39 and 6.50 , respectively. Based on the approved capital structure and costs, SCE s weighted average return on rate base for 2023 will be 7.44 . Based on the revenue requirement approved in SCE s 2021 GRC, the final decision will decrease SCE s revenue requirement for 2023 by approximately 90 million compared to the cost of capital currently in rates. In January an intervenor filed an application for rehearing, if the CPUC takes further action it may impact revenues being collected in rates during 2023. The cost of capital adjustment mechanism s benchmark beginning January 1, 2023, is the 12-month, October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022, average Moody s Baa utility bond yield of 4.37 . If the difference between the benchmark and the average of the same index for the 12-month period from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023 exceeds 100-basis points, SCE s CPUC-authorized ROE will be adjusted for 2024 by half the amount of the difference (up or down). The average Moody s Baa utility bond yield between October 1, 2022 and February 16, 2023 was 5.78 . The spot rate for Moody s Baa utility bond was 5.65 on February 16, 2023. An average Moody s Baa utility bond yield of 5.13 or higher from February 17, 2023 through September 30, 2023 would trigger the mechanism to adjust upward. Capital Program Total capital expenditures (including accruals) were 5.7 billion in 2022 and 5.4 billion in 2021. SCE s year-end rate base was 40.6 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to 37.9 billion at December 31, 2021, after excluding rate base associated with AB 1054 Excluded Capital Expenditures. SCE s 2022 recorded and 2023 2024 forecast capital expenditures are set forth in the table below:

See Liquidity and Capital Resources SCE Regulatory Proceedings for more information on the GRC track 4 filing. Potential capital spending variability associated with future regulatory requests based on management judgment, potential for permitting delays and other operational considerations is reflected in the range case above, including deferral of all activity on the Riverside Transmission Reliability Project during 2023. For more information, see Liquidity SCE Capital Investment Plan. The completion of projects, the timing of expenditures, and the associated cost recovery may be affected by permitting requirements and delays, construction schedules, availability of labor, equipment and materials, financing, legal and regulatory approvals and developments, community requests or protests, weather and other unforeseen conditions. In addition to the amounts presented in the table above SCE expects to make additional CPUC capital expenditures, the recovery of which will be subject to future regulatory approval. This includes expenditures to be requested in the 2025 GRC application which will reflect SCE s 2023 2025 WMP and non-GRC programs including the Building Electrification Program and an enterprise resource planning software implementation. These capital expenditures and expected FERC capital expenditures are expected to be in a range of approximately 5.3 billion to 6.8 billion in aggregate between 2024 and 2025.

 Utility Owned Storage Projects In October 2021, SCE contracted with Ameresco, Inc. Ameresco for the construction of utility owned energy storage projects at three sites in SCE s service territory with an aggregate capacity of 537.5 MW and an in-service date of August 1, 2022. In April 2022, SCE received a force majeure event notice from Ameresco in which Ameresco asserted that both manufacturing delays related to COVID-19 shut-downs in China and new shipping restrictions imposed by Chinese governmental authorities were then impacting the supply of batteries from China necessary for timely completion of the projects. Ameresco subsequently supplemented its force majeure notice noting additional supply chain issues related to COVID-19. Permitting delays and engineering issues and certain changes requested by SCE also impacted the projects in 2022. SCE expects to receive in aggregate approximately 270 million of tax credits available under the IRA for all three projects, which will accrue to the benefit of its customers. In January 2023, SCE received a force majeure event notice from Ameresco in which Ameresco asserted that severe winter storms in Southern California had impacted the timely completion of the projects. While Ameresco has advised SCE that it currently expects all three projects to be in-service prior to June 2023, SCE believes that there is risk of delay beyond Ameresco s projected in-service dates. SCE is continuing to evaluate the force majeure event notices and is awaiting additional information from Ameresco on the underlying events. If there is a valid force majeure event under the contracts with Ameresco, subject to certain conditions, the project schedules and any related triggers of liquidated damages may be extended, and the contract prices may be increased to account for the impact of the force majeure event. Because Ameresco did not achieve an in-service date of August 1, 2022, SCE is entitled to liquidated damages under the terms of the contracts subject to any relief Ameresco may be entitled to under the contracts, including any relief for any valid force majeure events. Once triggered, liquidated damages accrue daily for up to 60 days up to a maximum of 89 million in aggregate for all three projects. Subject to reductions for any liquidated damages SCE is paid, SCE currently expects these storage projects to result in 1.0 billion of capital expenditures. In December 2021, the CPUC approved recovery of these expenditures and establishment of a balancing account for the associated revenue requirement, which have been reflected in rates beginning in the first quarter of 2022. Authorized revenue requirements will be included in the annual ERRA review proceeding and can only be disallowed upon a finding that SCE failed to prudently administer the contracts. Southern California Wildfires and Mudslides California has experienced unprecedented weather conditions in recent years due to climate change. The worsening weather and fuel conditions across California increase the likelihood of wildfires, including those where SCE s equipment may be alleged to be associated with the fire s ignition, and SCE s service territory remains susceptible to additional wildfire activity in 2023 and beyond. In response to worsening conditions and increased wildfire activity over the past several years, SCE has developed and is implementing its WMP to reduce the risk of SCE equipment contributing to the ignition of wildfires. In addition, California has increased its investment in wildfire prevention and fire suppression capabilities. In addition to the investments SCE is making as part of its WMP, SCE also uses its PSPS program to proactively de-energize power lines as a last resort to mitigate the risk of significant wildfires during extreme weather events. Wildfires in SCE s territory in December 2017 and November 2018 caused loss of life, substantial damage to both residential and business properties, and service outages for SCE customers. SCE has incurred material losses in connection with the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events.

Table of Contents 
 SCE s equipment has been, and may further be, alleged to be associated with several wildfires that have originated in Southern California subsequent to 2018. Edison International and SCE expect that any losses incurred in connection with those fires will be covered by insurance, subject to self-insured retentions and co-insurance, recoveries through electric rates or third-party receivables, and expect that any such losses after recoveries will not be material. 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events Multiple lawsuits and investigations related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events have been initiated against SCE and Edison International. As of December 31, 2022, in addition to the Local Public Entity Settlement, the TKM Subrogation Settlement and the Woolsey Subrogation Settlement, SCE had entered into settlements with approximately 9,500 individual plaintiffs in the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events litigation. In addition, SCE and the SED executed the SED Agreement in October 2021, and SCE s obligations under the SED Agreement commenced on August 15, 2022, when CPUC approval of the SED Agreement became final and non-appealable. In 2022, SCE accrued estimated losses of 1.3 billion for the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. As a result, SCE also recorded expected recoveries through FERC electric rates of 76 million against the charge, and the resulting net charge to earnings was 1.2 billion 879 million after-tax). Through December 31, 2022, SCE has accrued estimated losses of 8.8 billion, expected recoveries from insurance of 2.0 billion and expected recoveries through FERC electric rates of 376 million related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. The after-tax net charges to earnings recorded through December 31, 2022 have been 4.6 billion. As of December 31, 2022, SCE had paid 7.6 billion under executed settlements and had 185 million to be paid under executed settlements, including 120 million to be paid under the SED Agreement, related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. As of the same date, SCE had recovered 2.0 billion through insurance and approximately 234 million through FERC-jurisdictional electric rates. After giving effect to all payment obligations under settlements entered into through December 31, 2022, including under the SED Agreement, Edison International s and SCE s best estimate of expected losses for remaining alleged and potential claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events was 934 million. As of the same date, SCE had assets for expected recoveries through FERC electric rates of 142 million on their consolidated balance sheets and had exhausted expected insurance recoveries related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. Edison International and SCE may incur a material loss in excess of amounts accrued in connection with the remaining alleged and potential claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. SCE will seek CPUC-jurisdictional rate recovery of prudently-incurred losses and related costs realized in connection with the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events in excess of available insurance and FERC-jurisdictional recoveries, other than for any obligations under the SED Agreement. Based on Edison International s and SCE s current best estimate of expected losses for the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, SCE currently expects to seek CPUC-jurisdictional rate recovery of approximately 6 billion by filing multiple future applications with the CPUC. SCE targets the third quarter of 2023 for the first of such cost recovery applications, and expects to request recovery of approximately 2 billion in that filing. SCE s plans with respect to these filings may be delayed or modified. For example, the filings may be delayed if proceedings related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events do not progress as anticipated. SCE believes that, in light of the CPUC s decision in a cost recovery proceeding involving SDG E arising from several 2007 wildfires in SDG E s service area, there is substantial uncertainty regarding how the CPUC will interpret and apply its prudency standard to an investor-owned utility in wildfire cost-recovery proceedings for fires ignited prior to the adoption of AB 1054 on July 12, 2019. Accordingly, while the CPUC has not made a determination regarding SCE s prudency relative to any of the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, SCE is unable to conclude, at this time, that uninsured 
 11 

Table of Contents 
 CPUC-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events are probable of recovery through electric rates. Post-2018 Wildfires Several wildfires have significantly impacted portions of SCE s service territory after 2018, including the 2019 Saddle Ridge Fire, the 2020 Bobcat Fire, the 2022 Coastal Fire and the 2022 Fairview Fire. In 2022, SCE recorded a 572 million increase in estimated losses for the Post-2018 Wildfires and recorded 399 million in expected insurance recoveries against the charge. In light of the prudency standard the CPUC is required to apply under AB 1054 to utilities holding a safety certificate at the time a wildfire ignited after July 12, 2019, SCE has concluded, at this time, that both uninsured CPUC-jurisdictional and uninsured FERC-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs related to the Post-2018 Wildfires, other than for those already authorized for inclusion in electric rates, are probable of recovery through electric rates. As a result, SCE also recorded expected recoveries through electric rates of 162 million against the charges accrued related to the Post-2018 Wildfires. The resulting net charge to earnings was 11 million 8 million after-tax). As of December 31, 2022, SCE had paid 13 million under executed settlements related to the Post-2018 Wildfires. After giving effect to all payment obligations under settlements entered into through December 31, 2022, Edison International s and SCE s estimated losses (established at the lower end of the estimated range of reasonably possible losses) for remaining alleged and potential claims related to the Post-2018 Wildfires was 682 million. As of the same date, SCE had assets for expected recoveries through insurance of 473 million and through electric rates of 166 million on their consolidated balance sheets related to the Post-2018 Wildfires. Expected recoveries from insurance recorded for the Post-2018 Wildfires are supported by SCE s insurance coverage for multiple policy years. While Edison International and SCE may incur material losses in excess of the amounts accrued for each of the Post-2018 Wildfires, Edison International and SCE expect that any losses incurred in connection with any such fire will be covered by insurance, subject to self-insured retentions and co-insurance, and expect that any such losses after expected recoveries from insurance and through electric rates will not be material.

Upstream Lighting Program From 2017 2019, SCE administered the Upstream Lighting Program, part of a statewide program administered by investor-owned utilities that offered discounted energy efficient light bulbs to customers through incentives to lighting manufacturers. The CPUC began investigating the programs administered by the investor-owned utilities based on reports that investor-owned utilities, including SCE, shipped a significant number of bulbs under the program that could not be tracked to customers. In May 2022, the CPUC issued an order directing SCE to show cause as to why SCE should not be required to: (i) refund ratepayer funding for the portion of the program budget associated with light bulbs that were unaccounted for, (ii) refund energy efficiency incentive mechanism ESPI awards associated with unaccounted-for light bulbs, and (iii) pay penalties for misrepresenting program progress and results to the CPUC. In September 2022, a Presiding Officer s Decision POD was issued in the proceeding finding that SCE mismanaged its Upstream Lighting Program from 2017 through 2019 and failed to ensure that efficient light bulbs were tracked and sold as intended by the program design. The POD requires SCE to (i) refund to ratepayers 76.1 million, representing the portion of the program budget associated

Table of Contents 
 with light bulbs that could not be accounted for, (ii) refund to ratepayers 6.8 million, representing ESPI awards associated with light bulbs that could not be accounted for, (iii) pay 19.06 million in fines; and (iv) bear the cost of SCE s investigation, approximately 900,000. The CPUC issued its final decision in November 2022 in line with the POD. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SCE SCE s results of operations are derived mainly through two sources: Earning activities representing revenue authorized by the CPUC and the FERC, which is intended to provide SCE a reasonable opportunity to recover its costs and earn a return on its net investment in generation, transmission, and distribution assets. The annual revenue requirements are comprised of authorized operation and maintenance costs, depreciation, taxes and a return consistent with the capital structure. Also, included in earnings activities are revenue or penalties related to incentive mechanisms, other operating revenue and regulatory charges or disallowances. Cost-recovery activities representing CPUC- and FERC-authorized balancing accounts which allow for recovery of specific project or program costs, subject to reasonableness review or compliance with upfront standards, as well as non-bypassable rates collected for SCE Recovery Funding LLC. Cost-recovery activities include rates which provide recovery, subject to reasonableness review of, among other things, fuel costs, purchased power costs, public purpose related-program costs (including energy efficiency and demand-side management programs), certain operation and maintenance expenses, (including vegetation management and wildfire insurance), and repayment of bonds and financing costs of SCE Recovery Funding LLC. SCE earns no return on these activities.

 Years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 The following table is a summary of SCE s results of operations for the periods indicated: 2022 2021 2020 Cost- Cost- Cost- Earning Recovery Total Earning Recovery Total Earning Recovery Total (in millions) Activities Activities Consolidated Activities Activities Consolidated Activities Activities Consolidated Operating revenue 9,008 8,164 17,172 7,872 7,002 14,874 7,468 6,078 13,546 Purchased power and fuel 6,375 6,375 5,540 5,540 2 4,930 4,932 Operation and maintenance 2,793 1,866 4,659 2,015 1,573 3,588 2,280 1,243 3,523 Wildfire-related claims, net of insurance recoveries 1,305 1,305 1,276 1,276 1,328 1,328 Wildfire Insurance Fund expense 214 214 215 215 336 336 Depreciation and amortization 2,540 19 2,559 2,209 7 2,216 1,965 1,965 Property and other taxes 482 15 497 462 462 435 435 Impairment, net of other (income) 50 50 67 67 (151) (151) Total operating expenses 7,384 8,275 15,659 6,244 7,120 13,364 6,195 6,173 12,368 Operating income (loss) 1,624 (111) 1,513 1,628 (118) 1,510 1,273 (95) 1,178 Interest expense (977) (28) (1,005) (785) (6) (791) (757) (11) (768) Other income 198 139 337 109 124 233 149 106 255 Income before income taxes 845 845 952 952 665 665 Income tax (benefit) expense (109) (109) 17 17 (277) (277) Net income 954 954 935 935 942 942 Less: Preference stock dividend requirements 107 107 106 106 132 132 Net income available for common stock 847 847 829 829 810 810 Earning Activities Earning activities in 2022 compared to 2021 were primarily affected by the following: Higher operating revenue of 1,136 million is primarily due to: 
 SCE recognized 701 million of revenue for wildfire-related expenses that had been deferred prior to 2021 and were authorized for recovery in the GRC track 2 in January 2022 and GRC track 3 in June 2022 416 million included in earnings activities, 285 million included in cost-recovery activities). An increase of CPUC-related revenue of 376 million primarily due to the escalation mechanism set forth in the 2021 GRC decision. SCE recognized 156 million of revenue on CPUC approval of recovery for CSRP-related costs in September 2022. The revenue comprised recovery of 174 million of previously deferred expenses and 48 million of previously unrecognized return on rate base and taxes, offset by 66 million of income tax benefits. See Liquidity and Capital Resources SCE Regulatory Proceedings for more information. An increase of other CPUC-related revenue of 121 million primarily related to higher return, taxes and operating expenses recovered through capital balancing accounts, including for wildfire mitigation expenditures. An increase in FERC-related revenue of 23 million primarily due to rate base growth. 
 14 

Table of Contents 
 An increase in other operating revenue of 44 million primarily due to deferred revenue and billing associated with the agreement with Morongo Transmission LLC (offset in depreciation, property and other taxes and operation and maintenance expenses). See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 7. Revenue for further information. Higher operation and maintenance costs of 778 million primarily due to the following: Higher expenses of 404 million subject to balancing account treatment including the approval in the GRC track 2 and GRC track 3 to recover wildfire-related expenses that had been deferred as regulatory assets prior to 2021 (offset in revenue above). Higher expenses of 95 million related to the POD in September 2022 on SCE s Upstream Lighting Program. This consisted of 76 million of disallowed costs reclassified from cost recovery activities and 19 million of fines. See Management Overview Upstream Lighting Program for further information. Higher expenses of 57 million related to inspections and maintenance. Higher expenses of 27 million previously deferred and expensed on approval for recovery in the CSRP decision (offset in revenue above). Higher uncollectibles expenses of 38 million, including prior period expenses not subject to cost recovery, following a CPUC decision, which required SCE to change its methodology for calculating the portion of uncollectibles expenses incremental to GRC authorized expenses. A charge of 23 million related to settlement of an employment litigation matter, net of estimated insurance recoveries. Higher expenses of 18 million of wildfire mitigation expenses that were disallowed in the GRC track 3 decision. A charge of 14 million related to organizational realignment services. Higher other expenses of 102 million including IT costs, franchise fees, capital related costs, safety programs related to COVID-19, and power plant maintenance costs. Higher wildfire-related claims and expenses of 29 million primarily due to higher estimated losses related to wildfire claims from the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events in 2022 compared to 2021. Higher depreciation and amortization expense of 331 million primarily due to 134 million of previously deferred CSRP depreciation expensed on approval for recovery in the CSRP decision (offset in revenue above) and increased plant balances in 2022. Higher property and other taxes of 20 million primarily due to higher property assessed value in 2022. Lower impairment and other operating income of 17 million primarily due to an impairment charge of 79 million recorded in 2021 related to disallowed historical capital expenditures in SCE s 2021 GRC final decision. Impairments were recorded in 2022 of 17 million related to the CPUC decision in the GRC track 3 proceeding and 47 million related to a settlement agreement between SCE and TURN in the CSRP proceeding. See Liquidity and Capital Resources SCE Regulatory Proceedings for more information. Higher interest expense of 192 million primarily due to increased long-term borrowing and higher interest rates on short-term debt and balancing account overcollections. 
 15 

Table of Contents 
 Higher other income of 89 million primarily due to a higher interest rates applied to balancing account undercollections and allowance for funds used during construction. See Income Taxes below for the explanation of 126 million increase in income tax benefits. 
 Cost-Recovery Activities Cost-recovery activities in 2022 compared to 2021 were primarily affected by the following: Higher purchased power and fuel costs of 835 million primarily due to higher power and gas prices, partially offset by lower load. Higher operation and maintenance costs of 293 million primarily due to: Higher expenses of 285 million of GRC track 2 and GRC track 3 wildfire mitigation expenses that had been deferred prior to 2021 and were authorized for recovery in January 2022 and June 2022, respectively. See Earnings Activities above. Higher uncollectible expenses of 83 million primarily due to authorization to recover 2020 and 2021 costs that had been previously deferred as regulatory assets through the residential uncollectibles balancing account. Lower cost recovery activity expenses due to 76 million of disallowed costs reclassified to earnings activities related to Upstream Lighting Program. See Earnings Activities above. Higher depreciation and amortization expense of 12 million due to recovery of expenses associated with AB 1054 Excluded Capital Expenditures financed through securitization. Higher property and other taxes of 15 million due to recovery of property taxes associated with AB 1054 Excluded Capital Expenditures financed through securitization. Higher interest expense of 22 million primarily due to recovery of expenses associated with AB 1054 Excluded Capital Expenditures financed through securitization . Higher other income of 15 million primarily driven by higher income related to the non-service cost components for SCE s pension benefit plans. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 9. Compensation and Benefit Plans for further information. 
 Supplemental Operating Revenue Information As a result of the CPUC-authorized decoupling mechanism, SCE revenues are not affected by changes in retail electricity sales. Income Taxes Lower income tax expense of 126 million in 2022 compared to 2021 (a tax benefit was recorded in 2022) was primarily driven by a decrease in pre-tax income and the absence of a one-time charge recorded in 2021. In July 2021, SCE received the IRS s response to its private letter ruling request, regarding the scope of the deferred tax normalization requirements and the computations required to comply with the average rate assumption method. As a result of the IRS ruling, SCE s estimate changed, and a charge was recorded in 2021 to reduce the 2018 through 2021 cumulative tax benefits returned to customers. The effective tax rates were (12.9) and 1.8 for 2022 and 2021, respectively. SCE s effective tax rate is below the federal statutory rate of 21 for 2022 and 2021 primarily due to the CPUC s ratemaking treatment for the current tax benefit arising from certain property-related and other temporary differences, which reverse

 over time. The accounting treatment for these temporary differences results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that would otherwise be recorded to deferred income tax expense. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 8. Income Taxes for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective income tax rates. Edison International Parent and Other Results of operations for Edison International Parent and Other include amounts from other subsidiaries that are not reportable as segments, as well as intercompany eliminations. Loss from Operations The following table summarizes the results of Edison International Parent and Other: 

Years ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Edison Energy Group and subsidiaries (17) (15) (35) Corporate expenses and other subsidiaries (113) 5 (36) Edison International Parent and Other net loss (130) (10) (71) Less: Preferred stock dividend requirement 105 60 Edison International Parent and Other net loss attributable to common shareholders (235) (70) (71) The net loss attributable to common shareholders from operations of Edison International Parent and Other increased 165 million in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to an income tax benefit of 110 million recorded in 2021 related to the settlement of the 2007 2012 California tax audits with the FTB and higher preferred dividends in 2022. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES SCE SCE s ability to operate its business, fund capital expenditures, and implement its business strategy is dependent upon its cash flow and access to the bank and capital markets. SCE s overall cash flows fluctuate based on, among other things, its ability to recover its costs in a timely manner from its customers through regulated rates, changes in commodity prices and volumes, collateral requirements, interest obligations, dividend payments to and equity contributions from Edison International, obligations to preference shareholders, and the outcome of tax, regulatory and legal matters. In the next 12 months, SCE expects to fund its cash requirements through operating cash flows, capital market and bank financings and equity contributions from Edison International Parent , as needed. SCE also has availability under its credit facility to fund cash requirements. SCE expects to issue bonds to finance or refinance eligible sustainable projects. Eligible sustainable projects include categories such as renewable energy, clean transportation, energy efficiency and carbon reduction, climate change adaptation, and socioeconomic advancement and empowerment. SCE maintains processes to ensure that proceeds from the sale of the bonds are only used for projects that are aligned with the Edison International sustainable financing framework issued in June 2021. SCE also expects to issue additional debt for general corporate purposes and to finance payments for future resolutions of claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. SCE has invested all 1.6 billion of the required AB 1054 Excluded Capital Expenditures. SCE issued securitized bonds in the amounts of 338 million and 533 million in February 2021 and 2022, respectively, to finance a portion of these expenditures. SCE expects to use the proceeds of future securitized bonds to repay a term loan of 730 million prior to its maturity in May 2023, which financed the remaining AB 1054 Excluded Capital Expenditures . SCE has filed a regulatory application for authorization to issue additional securitized bonds. For further information, see Regulatory Proceedings Financing Order.

 The IRA was signed into law in August 2022. See Edison International Parent and Other Edison International Income Taxes for a description of the impacts of the legislation on the Edison International consolidated tax group including SCE. The following table summarizes SCE s current, long-term issuer credit ratings and outlook from the major credit rating agencies: 

Moody s Fitch S P Credit Rating Baa2 BBB- BBB Outlook Positive Positive Stable SCE s credit ratings may be affected if, among other things, regulators fail to successfully implement AB 1054 in a consistent and credit supportive manner or the Wildfire Insurance Fund is depleted by claims from catastrophic wildfires. Credit rating downgrades increase the cost and may impact the availability of short-term and long-term borrowings, including commercial paper, credit facilities, bond financings or other borrowings. In addition, some of SCE s power procurement contracts and environmental remediation obligations would require SCE to pay related liabilities or post additional collateral if SCE s credit rating were to fall below investment grade. For further details, see Margin and Collateral Deposits. Available Liquidity At December 31, 2022, SCE had cash on hand of 766 million and approximately 2.7 billion available to borrow on its 3.4 billion revolving credit facility. The credit facility is available for borrowing needs until May 2026. At December 31, 2022, SCE had 195 million outstanding commercial paper, net of discount, at a weighted average interest rate of 5.20 . The aggregate maximum principal amount under the SCE revolving credit facility may be increased up to 4.0 billion, provided that additional lender commitments are obtained. For further details, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 5. Debt and Credit Agreements. SCE may finance balancing account undercollections and working capital requirements to support operations and capital expenditures with commercial paper, its credit facilities or other borrowings, subject to availability in the bank and capital markets. As necessary, SCE will utilize its available liquidity, capital market financings, other borrowings or parent company contributions to SCE equity in order to meet its obligations as they become due, including costs related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. For further information, see Management Overview Southern California Wildfires and Mudslides. Debt Covenant SCE s credit facilities and term loan require a debt to total capitalization ratio as defined in the applicable agreements of less than or equal to 0.65 to 1. At December 31, 2022, SCE s debt to total capitalization ratio was 0.56 to 1. At December 31, 2022, SCE was in compliance with all financial covenants that affect access to capital. Regulatory Proceedings Wildfire Related Regulatory Proceedings In response to the increase in wildfire activity, and faster progression of and increased damage from wildfires across SCE s service territory and throughout California, SCE has incurred wildfire mitigation, wildfire insurance and wildfire and drought restoration related spending at levels significantly exceeding amounts authorized in SCE s GRCs.

 2021 General Rate Case Wildfire Mitigation Memorandum Account Balances The 2021 GRC decision authorized the establishment of balancing accounts for expenses for vegetation management, wildfire insurance, and the WCCP program, with expenditures up to certain thresholds approved for cost recovery. SCE may submit subsequent reasonableness review applications for any spending in excess of these thresholds. SCE has incurred, and in 2023 expects to incur, vegetation management expenses and capital expenditures for WCCP in excess of thresholds established in the 2021 GRC. SCE has also incurred, and in 2023 expects to incur, costs in excess of amounts authorized in the 2021 GRC related to other wildfire mitigation activities, including inspections and maintenance and to support execution of PSPS events. SCE tracks these incremental amounts in memorandum accounts which will be subject to approval in future regulatory proceedings. For more information see Business SCE Overview of Ratemaking Process. In June 2022, SCE filed an application with the CPUC requesting reasonableness review of these incremental costs incurred in 2021 related to non-covered conductor wildfire mitigation and vegetation management activities, requesting a total revenue requirement of approximately 327 million. In October 2022, the CPUC temporarily suspended the procedural schedule for the proceeding to consider whether there is a sufficient record in the proceeding to address the issue of whether recorded costs are incremental, reasonable, and properly recoverable. In December 2022, the CPUC began to conduct an audit of SCE s 2021 incurred costs, with an expectation of issuing an audit report in July 2023. 2021 General Rate Case Track 3 In June 2022, the CPUC issued a decision on SCE s 2021 GRC track 3 filing that authorized SCE to recover 385 million of incremental wildfire mitigation operation and maintenance expense and approved 465 million of incremental wildfire mitigation capital expenditures as reasonable. SCE did not obtain a determination of reasonableness for an additional 197 million of capital expenditures, associated with construction in progress, plant assets and installation of current limiting fuses, portions of which were defective. SCE expects to provide additional information supporting its application for recovery of approximately 25 million of current limiting fuses expenditure in its 2025 GRC application. The construction in progress not approved as reasonable in the 2021 GRC track 3 was not eligible for inclusion in SCE s final financing order application, but is being recovered as part of SCE s authorized rate base included in the 2021 GRC decision on a forecast basis. The decision did not find reasonable certain capital expenditures related to vegetation management software purchased by SCE. As a result of the decision, SCE recorded a 17 million impairment of utility property, plant and equipment. In October 2022, SCE filed a request to seek recovery of 35 million, after accounting for a 10 million deductible, for vegetation management-related operations and maintenance expenses not approved in this proceeding. These increased costs are tracked in a Z-Factor memorandum account for vegetation management line clearance costs related to Senate Bill 247, which went into effect January 1, 2020, and requires SCE to pay line clearance tree trimmers the prevailing wage of qualified electrical workers. The decision resulted in a revenue requirement of approximately 400 million including a 15 million 2020 revenue requirement for capital expenditures previously found reasonable by the CPUC. The approved revenue requirements are required to be amortized over a 36-month period. SCE is seeking recovery of the approved capital expenditures in a separate financing order application. See Financing Order below. Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account SCE tracks insurance premium costs related to wildfire liability insurance policies as well as other wildfire-related costs in its WEMA. In December 2020, SCE filed a WEMA application with the CPUC to seek recovery of 215 million of costs recorded in WEMA at December 31, 2020. The costs primarily related to incremental wildfire insurance premium 
 19 

Table of Contents 
 expenses and associated costs for wildfire liability insurance policies that provide coverage for the last six months of 2020. In October 2022, the CPUC extended the statutory deadline for completion of the proceeding to April 2023. SCE believes that uninsured CPUC-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs related to the Post-2018 Wildfires, other than for those already authorized for inclusion in electric rates, are probable of recovery through electric rates. As of December 31, 2022, SCE has recorded total expected recoveries related to the Post-2018 Wildfires of 152 million within the WEMA and risk management balancing accounts. 2020 Emergency Wildfire Restoration Multiple wildfires occurred during 2020 which caused damage within SCE s service territory and to SCE s Big Creek hydroelectric facility. In March 2022, SCE filed a CEMA application requesting recovery of 207 million of operation and maintenance expenses incremental to authorized revenue requirements and 312 million of capital expenditures incremental to amounts authorized in the 2021 GRC primarily related to these restoration efforts. SCE has not yet filed for recovery of generation restoration costs, as repairs to hydroelectric generation facilities are not complete. 2021 General Rate Case Track 4 SCE made its 2021 GRC track 4 filing with the CPUC in May 2022. SCE is requesting a revenue requirement of 8.6 billion for 2024. This represents an increase of 938 million compared to SCE s revenue requirement of 7.7 billion for the 2023 attrition year. A significant component of the track 4 revenue requirement request relates to projects previously authorized by the CPUC, including those which were completed and put into service since the 2021 GRC final decision. The other primary drivers of the increase are inflation and SCE s 2024 vegetation management and wildfire mitigation spending forecasts, partially due to a legislatively required wage rate increase. The schedule adopted by the CPUC for the 2021 GRC track 4 filing calls for a proposed decision in the fourth quarter of 2023. Financing Order In September 2022, SCE filed its third application for an irrevocable order from the CPUC to finance 772 million, comprised of AB1054 Excluded Capital Expenditures, allowed overhead costs and associated financing expenses, through the issuance of securitized bonds. The expenditures consist of 204 million approved in the 2021 GRC track 1 and 465 million approved in the 2021 GRC track 3. SCE received a proposed decision on this application in January 2023, which would authorize the issuance of securitized bonds, if approved. SCE expects a final decision in the first quarter of 2023. CSRP In September 2022, the CPUC approved SCE s CSRP proceeding for expenditures incurred through April 2021. The approval resulted in a revenue requirement of 388 million through December 2024. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Polices Impairments of Long-lived Assets for further information. In May 2022, SCE filed a second CSRP application with the CPUC requesting recovery of 59 million of capital expenditures and 28 million of operation and maintenance expenses incurred from May 2021 to December 2021. SCE also expects to propose review and cost recovery for additional post-implementation CSRP costs incurred from January 2022 through December 2024 in its 2025 GRC filing.

 ERRA Proceeding SCE s cost-recovery mechanism for its fuel and purchased power-related costs is facilitated in three main balancing accounts, the ERRA, the PABA, and the NSGBA. SCE sets rates based on an annual forecast of the costs that it expects to incur during the subsequent year. The undercollection in ERRA and PABA during 2022 resulted in SCE triggering an established mechanism requiring SCE to file an application to advise the CPUC that SCE s undercollections had exceeded the trigger amount. In December 2022, the CPUC approved inclusion of the undercollection in a January 1, 2023 rate change. At December 31, 2022, the ERRA and PABA were undercollected by approximately 1.5 billion due to higher gas and power prices and in January 2023, SCE notified the CPUC of a further trigger of the mechanism. Due to the new rate effective in January 2023, undercollections are expected to decrease, however, if undercollections remain above the trigger level, it could result in a further adjustment to customer rates during 2023. See Business SCE Overview of Ratemaking Process for further information. In October 2022, as part of the 2020 ERRA review proceeding, the CPUC rejected the methodology SCE used to calculate the portion of uncollectibles expense incremental to amounts authorized in SCE s GRC. This led to a disallowance of 16 million of uncollectibles expense recorded to the residential uncollectible balancing account RUBA in 2020. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022, SCE modified its methodology for calculating incremental uncollectibles expense to be included in RUBA to align with the decision. 2023 FERC Formula Rate Annual Update In November 2022, SCE filed its 2023 annual transmission revenue requirement update with the FERC, with the proposed rate effective January 1, 2023. The update reflects a 2 million increase from SCE s 2022 transmission revenue requirement included in customer rates. The 2023 filing was in line with the 2022 transmission revenue requirement due to significant wildfire-related claims expenses recorded in both years. 2022 California Arrearage Payment Program CAPP 2022 In June 2022, California s State Assembly passed legislation to authorize, fund and implement the CAPP 2022, which is expected to reduce customer arrearages for certain residential customers of California s investor-owned utilities by up to 1.0 billion. In November 2022, SCE received 202 million of CAPP funds on behalf of customers, which has been applied to accounts receivable outstanding from individual customers. To the extent SCE s uncollectibles expenses have been offset by the CAPP 2022, recovery will not be sought through other mechanisms. Building Electrification Programs Application In December 2021, SCE filed a 677 million Building Electrification Program Application for a four-year program (2024 2027) to incentivize replacing 250,000 gas-fueled water and space heaters with efficient electric heat pumps and to upgrade or enhance the electrical infrastructure for 65,000 homes to support electrification. The proposed program would include 200 million for customer-side electrical infrastructure upgrades for which SCE has requested inclusion as a regulatory asset in rate base, 69 million in capital expenditures and 408 million of operations and maintenance expense including heat pump incentives, program administration, and implementation costs. The CPUC is expected to issue a final decision on the application in mid-2023.

 1 Direct expenditures include direct labor, land and contract costs incurred for the respective projects and exclude overhead costs that are included in the capital expenditures forecast discussed in Management Overview Capital Program. 2 Expenditures and in-service date are based on CPUC approved plans and may be impacted by any changes to those plans required by Riverside City Council. 3 Includes the original estimated project cost for Alberhill. In January 2020, SCE submitted a supplemental analysis to the CPUC which included alternative projects as well as an update to the original project cost. SCE is unable to predict the timing of a final CPUC decision, the corresponding in-service date, and what the final project costs will be for the Alberhill System Project. 
 Riverside Transmission Reliability Project The Riverside Transmission Reliability Project is a joint project between SCE and Riverside Public Utilities RPU ), the municipal utility department of the City of Riverside. While RPU will be responsible for constructing some of the project s facilities within Riverside, SCE s portion of the project consists of constructing upgrades to its system, including a new 230 kV substation; certain interconnection and telecommunication facilities and transmission lines in the cities of Riverside, Jurupa Valley and Norco and in portions of unincorporated Riverside County. In May 2022, the Riverside City Council voted to review and advise on alternatives to the CPUC approved project. Consequently, SCE suspended all major activities on the project. In January 2023, the City Council voted to establish a working group to pursue funding for additional undergrounding. SCE s capital forecast currently includes 128 million and 190 million of Riverside Transmission Reliability Project expenditures in 2023 and 2024, respectively, which may be affected by further delays to the project. Alberhill System Project The Alberhill System Project consists of constructing a new 500 kV substation, two 500 kV transmission lines to connect the proposed substation to the existing Serrano-Valley 500 kV transmission line, telecommunication equipment and subtransmission lines in western Riverside County. The project was designed to meet long-term forecasted electrical demand in the proposed Alberhill System Project area and to increase electrical system reliability and resiliency. In April 2018 and July 2018, the CPUC issued a proposed decision and an alternate proposed decision, both denying SCE s ability to construct the Alberhill System Project based on a perceived lack of need. SCE filed comments on both proposed decisions requesting that the CPUC grant the certificate of public convenience and necessity CPCN for the Alberhill System Project. In August 2018, the CPUC issued a decision that did not deny or approve the Alberhill System Project but directed SCE to submit supplemental information on the Alberhill System Project including but not limited to a load forecast and cost benefit analysis of several alternatives to the proposed project. Ongoing capital spending has been deferred as a result of the CPUC request for additional information. In January 2020, SCE submitted a supplemental analysis to the CPUC for the Alberhill System Project including several alternatives to the proposed project as well as an update to the original project cost. A final decision on the Alberhill System Project remains

 pending. Given the uncertainty associated with the resolution of the permitting process, potential revisions to the project have not been reflected in total direct expenditures. SCE continues to believe a system solution is needed for the project area but is unable to predict the timing of a final CPUC decision in connection with the Alberhill System Project proceeding. Approximately 48 of the Alberhill System Project costs spent to date would be subject to recovery through CPUC revenue and 52 through FERC revenue. In October 2017, SCE obtained approval from the FERC for abandoned plant treatment for the Alberhill System Project, which allows SCE to seek recovery of 100 of all prudently incurred costs after the approval date and 50 of prudently incurred costs prior to the approval date. Excluding land costs, which may be recovered through sale to a third party, SCE has incurred approximately 59 million and 55 million of capital expenditures, including overhead costs, of which approximately 42 million and 39 million may not be recoverable if the project is cancelled, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Eldorado-Lugo-Mohave Upgrade Project The Eldorado-Lugo-Mohave Upgrade Project will increase capacity on existing transmission lines to allow additional renewable energy to flow from Nevada to southern California. The project would modify SCE s existing Eldorado, Lugo, and Mohave electrical substations to accommodate the increased flows from Nevada to southern California; increase the power flow through the existing 500 kV transmission lines by constructing two new capacitors along the lines; raise transmission tower heights to meet ground clearance requirements; and install fiber optics on the transmission lines to provide communications between existing SCE substations. In August 2020, the CPUC approved the CPCN for the project. Construction for the project began in November 2020 and the project is expected to be operational in the second quarter of 2023. Other Capital Investment Projects and Programs For a discussion of utility owned storage and forecast wildfire mitigation capital expenditures, including the WCCP, see Management Overview Capital Program. For discussion of Electrification and Clean Energy Transition Programs, see Regulatory Proceedings Building Electrification Programs Application. Decommissioning of San Onofre The decommissioning of a nuclear plant requires the management of three related activities: radiological decommissioning, non-radiological decommissioning and the management of spent nuclear fuel. SCE has engaged the DGC to undertake a significant scope of decommissioning activities for Units 1, 2 and 3 at San Onofre. The decommissioning of San Onofre is expected to take many years. Under federal law, the U.S. Department of Energy DOE is responsible for the selection and construction of a facility for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. The DOE has not met its contractual obligation to accept spent nuclear fuel. Extended delays by the DOE have led to the construction of costly alternatives and associated siting and environmental issues. Two Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations ISFSI store nuclear fuel onsite at San Onofre. The first primarily stores nuclear fuel from Unit 1 ISFSI 1 and the second stores nuclear fuel from Units 2 and 3 ISFSI 2 ). SCE s CDPs for ISFSI 1 and ISFSI 2 extend through 2035. Decommissioning of San Onofre Unit 1 began in 1999 and the transfer of spent nuclear fuel from Unit 1 to dry cask storage in ISFSI 1 was completed in 2005. Major decommissioning work for Unit 1 has been completed except for certain underground work.

 Decommissioning of San Onofre Units 2 and 3 began in June 2013 and the transfer of spent nuclear fuel from San Onofre Units 2 and 3 to dry cask storage in the two ISFSIs was completed in August 2020. In October 2019, the California Coastal Commission approved SCE s application for a CDP, the principal discretionary permit required to start major decommissioning activities at San Onofre Units 2 and 3. In August 2020, SCE commenced, and is currently conducting, major decommissioning activities in accordance with the terms of the permit. In the third quarter of 2021, SCE updated its decommissioning cost estimate for decommissioning activities to be completed at San Onofre Units 2 and 3 to 3.4 billion (SCE share is 2.6 billion) in 2021 dollars. The decommissioning cost estimate included costs through the expected decommissioning completion date, currently estimated to be in 2053 for San Onofre Units 2 and 3. SCE filed its updated decommissioning cost estimate with the CPUC in February 2022. Decommissioning cost estimates are subject to a number of uncertainties including the cost and timing of nuclear waste disposal, the time it will take to obtain required permits, cost of removal of property, site remediation costs, as well as a number of other assumptions and estimates, including when the federal government will provide for either interim or permanent off-site storage of spent nuclear fuel enabling the removal and transport of spent fuel canisters from the San Onofre site, as to which there can be no assurance. Cost estimates are subject to change as decommissioning proceeds and such changes may be material. SCE s share of the San Onofre Units 2 and 3 decommissioning costs recorded during 2022 and 2021 were 187 million (in 2022 dollars) and 236 million (in 2021 dollars), respectively. The CPUC conducts a reasonableness review of recorded decommissioning costs. In February 2022, SCE filed its application for reasonableness review of approximately 570 million (SCE share in 2022 dollars) of recorded San Onofre Units 2 and 3 decommissioning costs incurred during the period 2018 to 2020. Intervenors in the proceeding have recommended approximately 115 million (SCE share in 2022 dollars) in disallowances for San Onofre Units 2 and 3 decommissioning costs. This amount includes a recommended disallowance of approximately 45 million in costs associated with an August 2018 incident that occurred when an SCE contractor was loading a spent nuclear fuel canister into an ISFSI resulting in fuel transfer operations being suspended for approximately one year. The remainder of the recommended disallowance amount is primarily for contractor staffing costs incurred during a delay in issuance of the CDP to allow for decommissioning. SCE had nuclear decommissioning trust funds for San Onofre Units 2 and 3 of 2.2 billion and 2.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Based upon the resolution of a number of uncertainties, including the uncertainties of decommissioning discussed above, the financial performance of the nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments, as well as the resolution of a number of other assumptions and estimates, additional contributions to the nuclear decommissioning trust s funds may be required. If additional contributions to the nuclear decommissioning trust funds become necessary, SCE will seek recovery of such additional funds through electric rates and any such recovery will be subject to a reasonableness review by the CPUC. Cost increases resulting from contractual disputes, delays in performance by the contractor, elevated levels of inflation, or permitting delays, among other things, could cause SCE to materially overrun the decommissioning cost estimate and could materially impact the sufficiency of trust funds. In December 2022, the CPUC approved disbursements from SCE s nuclear decommissioning trusts to cover forecasted 2023 decommissioning costs for San Onofre Units 2 and 3, of which SCE s share is approximately 300 million in 2023 dollars.

 SCE Dividends CPUC holding company rules require that SCE s dividend policy be established by SCE s Board of Directors on the same basis as if SCE were a stand-alone utility company, and that the capital requirements of SCE, as deemed to be necessary to meet SCE s electricity service obligations, shall receive first priority from the Boards of Directors of both Edison International and SCE. In addition, the CPUC regulates SCE s capital structure which limits the dividends it may pay to its shareholders. The common equity component of SCE s CPUC authorized capital structure is 52 on a weighted average basis over the Capital Structure Compliance Period, unchanged from the January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022 compliance period. The CPUC authorized capital structure differs from the capital structure calculated based on GAAP due to certain exclusions allowed by CPUC, including the impact of SCE s contributions to the Wildfire Insurance Fund under AB 1054. For further information, see Business SCE Overview of Ratemaking Process and Business Southern California Wildfires. In May 2020, the CPUC issued a decision on SCE s application to the CPUC for waiver of compliance with its equity ratio requirement, that allows SCE to exclude from its equity ratio calculations (i) net charges accrued in connection with the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events and (ii) debt issued for the purpose of paying claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events up to an amount equal to the net charges accrued in connection with the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. With these exclusions, SCE was in compliance with its authorized capital structure for the compliance period from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022. The temporary exclusion lapsed on May 7, 2022. In April 2022, SCE filed another application requesting continued waiver of compliance with its equity ratio requirement. Under the CPUC s rules, SCE will not be deemed to be in violation of the equity ratio requirement while the waiver application is pending resolution. While the exclusion is in place, SCE is required to notify the CPUC if an adverse financial event reduces SCE s spot equity ratio by more than one percent from the level most recently filed with the CPUC in the proceeding. The last spot equity ratio SCE filed with the CPUC in the proceeding did not exclude the then 1.8 billion net charge and was 45.2 as of December 31, 2018 (at the time the common equity component of SCE s CPUC authorized capital structure was required to remain at or above 48 on a weighted average basis over the applicable 37-month period). SCE s spot equity ratio on December 31, 2018 would have been 48.7 had the 1.8 billion net charge at December 31, 2018 been excluded, therefore SCE will notify the CPUC if its spot ratio drops below 47.7 in any quarter. For further information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies Contingencies Southern California Wildfires and Mudslides. SCE monitors its compliance with the CPUC s equity ratio requirement based on the weighted average of the common equity component of SCE s CPUC authorized capital structure over the Capital Structure Compliance Period using its actual capital structure from the beginning of the Capital Structure Compliance Period through the reporting date together with forecasted performance and expected financing activities for the remainder of the Capital Structure Compliance Period. SCE expects to be compliant with its CPUC authorized capital structure at the end of the Capital Structure Compliance Period. SCE s ability to declare and pay common dividends may be restricted under the terms of its outstanding series of preference stock. For further information see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 14. Equity. As a California corporation, SCE s ability to pay dividends is also governed by the California General Corporation Law. California law requires that for a dividend to be declared: (a) retained earnings must equal or exceed the proposed dividend, or (b) immediately after the dividend is made, the value of the corporation s assets must exceed the value of its liabilities plus amounts required to be paid, if any, in order to liquidate stock senior to the shares receiving the dividend. Additionally, a California corporation may not declare a dividend if it is, or as a result of the dividend would be, likely to be unable to meet its liabilities as they mature. Prior to declaring dividends, SCE s Board of Directors evaluates available information, including when applicable, information pertaining to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, to ensure 
 25

 that the California law requirements for the declarations are met. On February 23, 2023, SCE declared a dividend to Edison International of 350 million. The timing and amount of future dividends are also dependent on a number of other factors including SCE s requirements to fund other obligations and capital expenditures, and its ability to access the capital markets and generate operating cash flows and earnings. If SCE incurs significant costs related to catastrophic wildfires and is unable to recover such costs through insurance, the Wildfire Insurance Fund (for fires after July 12, 2019), or from customers or is unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms, SCE may be limited in its ability to pay future dividends to Edison International and its preference shareholders. Margin and Collateral Deposits Certain derivative instruments, power and energy procurement contracts and other contractual arrangements contain collateral requirements. In addition, certain environmental remediation obligations require financial assurance that may be in the form of collateral postings. Future collateral requirements may differ from the requirements at December 31, 2022 due to the addition of incremental power and energy procurement contracts with collateral requirements, if any, the impact of changes in wholesale power and natural gas prices on SCE s contractual obligations, and the impact of SCE s credit ratings falling below investment grade. The table below provides the amount of collateral posted by SCE to its counterparties as well as the potential collateral that would have been required as of December 31, 2022, if SCE s credit rating had been downgraded to below investment grade as of that date. The table below also provides the potential collateral that could be required due to adverse changes in wholesale power and natural gas prices over the remaining lives of existing power and fuel derivative contracts. Natural gas prices have increased significantly in 2022 due to global demand and extreme weather conditions in the USA, which resulted in substantially higher collateral postings and potential collateral requirements during the year. In addition to amounts shown in the table, power and fuel contract counterparties may also institute new collateral requirements, applicable to future transactions to allow SCE to continue trading in power and fuel contracts at the time of a downgrade or upon significant increases in market prices. In particular, SCE has an agreement with a counterparty for gas transport and balancing services through their pipeline. In December 2022, extreme winter conditions combined with pipeline constraints led to extremely high natural gas prices and usage, which affected collateral terms within the arrangement. Through December 31, 2022, the counterparty could have contractually requested 118 million in collateral from SCE but waived the amount, given the extraordinary conditions. Furthermore, SCE may also be required to post up to 50 million in collateral in connection with its environmental remediation obligations, within 120 days of the end of the fiscal year in which the downgrade occurs.

Edison International Parent and Other In the next 12 months, Edison International expects to fund its net cash requirements through cash on hand, dividends from SCE, and capital market and bank financings. Edison International may finance its ongoing cash requirements, including dividends, working capital requirements, payment of obligations, and capital investments, including capital contributions to subsidiaries, with short-term or other financings, subject to availability in the bank and capital markets. At December 31, 2022, Edison International Parent had cash on hand of 148 million and 1.4 billion available to borrow on its 1.5 billion revolving credit facility. The credit facility is available for borrowing needs until May 2026. At December 31, 2022 Edison International Parent had 90 million outstanding commercial paper, net of discount, at a weighted-average interest rate of 4.92 supported by the 1.5 billion revolving credit facility. The aggregate maximum principal amount under the Edison International Parent revolving credit facility may be increased up to 2.0 billion, provided that additional lender commitments are obtained. For further details, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 5. Debt and Credit Agreements. Edison International Parent has 1.4 billion of debt maturities arising in the next 12 months. Edison International expects to finance these maturities with 300 million to 400 million of equity content, as viewed by ratings agencies, and expects to issue debt for the remainder. In August 2022, Edison International Parent established a program to sell shares of its common stock with aggregate sales price up to 500 million, including through designated broker-dealers at prevailing market prices (an at-the-market offering). For further information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 14. Equity. On February 23, 2023, Edison International declared a dividend of 0.7375 per share to be paid on April 30, 2023. Edison International Parent and Other s liquidity and its ability to pay operating expenses and pay dividends to common shareholders are dependent on access to the bank and capital markets, dividends from SCE, realization of tax benefits and its ability to meet California law requirements for the declaration of dividends. Prior to declaring dividends, Edison International s Board of Directors evaluates available information, including when applicable, information pertaining to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, to ensure that the California law requirements for the declarations are met. For information on the California law requirements on the declaration of dividends, see SCE SCE Dividends. Edison International intends to maintain its target payout ratio of 45 55 of SCE s core earnings, subject to the factors identified above. Edison International s ability to declare and pay common dividends may be restricted under the terms of the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock. For further information see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 14. Equity.

 Edison International Parent s credit facility requires a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio as defined in the applicable agreements of less than or equal to 0.70 to 1. At December 31, 2022, Edison International s consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio was 0.64 to 1. At December 31, 2022, Edison International Parent was in compliance with all financial covenants that affect access to capital. The following table summarizes Edison International Parent s current long-term issuer credit ratings and outlook from the major credit rating agencies: 

Moody s Fitch S P Credit Rating Baa3 BBB- BBB Outlook Positive Positive Stable Edison International Parent s credit ratings may be affected if, among other things, regulators fail to successfully implement AB 1054 in a consistent and credit supportive manner or the Wildfire Insurance Fund is depleted by claims from catastrophic wildfires. Credit rating downgrades increase the cost and may impact the availability of short-term and long-term borrowings, including commercial paper, credit facilities, note financings or other borrowings. Edison International Income Taxes Net Operating Loss and Tax Credit Carryforwards Edison International has approximately 3.4 billion of tax effected net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards at December 31, 2022 (after excluding 121 million of Capistrano Wind attributes and offsetting 310 million of unrecognized tax benefits), which are available to offset future consolidated tax liabilities. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 8. Income Taxes for further information regarding taxes payable to Capistrano Wind. Edison International expects to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards through 2029 based on currently enacted tax laws. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 On August 16, 2022, the IRA was signed into law. The law imposes a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax CAMT on adjusted financial statement income AFSI of corporations with average AFSI exceeding 1 billion over a specified 3-year period. The CAMT will be effective January 1, 2023. Based on the current interpretation of the law and historical financial data, Edison International estimates that it will exceed the 1 billion threshold and be subject to CAMT on its consolidated Federal tax returns beginning in 2025. SCE expects to be subject to CAMT on its stand-alone Federal return beginning in 2024. The law also includes significant extensions, expansions, and enhancements of numerous energy-related investment tax credits, as well as creating new credits applicable to electricity production which may apply to SCE s capital expenditures. Under the IRA, SCE expects to generate investment tax credits related to its utility owned storage projects, which will accrue to the benefit of its customers.

The 2021 amounts were primarily related to settlement payments of 3.9 billion for 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, partially offset by an increase of 1.3 billion in liabilities for the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. 4 Represents 400 million proceeds from Morongo Transmission LLC for use of a portion of the West of Devers transmission line in 2021. 5 Includes changes in wildfire-related insurance receivables. Also includes nuclear decommissioning trusts activities. See Nuclear Decommissioning Activities below for further information. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by the following: Net income and non-cash items increased in 2022 by 186 million from 2021 primarily due to higher revenue due to the escalation mechanism as set forth in the 2021 GRC final decision and higher return on rate base from capital balancing accounts, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses and higher interest expense. Net cash provided by operating activities was also impacted by cash outflow of 95 million related to SCE s contributions to the Wildfire Insurance Fund in both 2022 and 2021. See Business Southern California Wildfires for further information.

Table of Contents 
 Net cash inflow (outflow) for working capital was 327 million and (705) million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The net cash inflow for working capital for 2022 was mainly due to an increase in payables of 343 million driven by higher payables on power purchase contracts and a net decrease of 24 million in customer receivables and unbilled revenue primarily from 387 million of CAPP funds received in 2022, partially offset by lower collections. The net cash outflow for working capital in 2021 was mainly due to net increases in unbilled revenue and customer receivables of 700 million. Net cash used in regulatory assets and liabilities, including the increase in net undercollections of balancing accounts, was 51 million and 720 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. SCE has a number of balancing and memorandum accounts, which impact cash flows based on differences between timing of collection of amounts through rates and accrual expenditures. Cash flows were primarily impacted by the following: 2022 Net undercollections of BRRBA increased by 259 million primarily due to inclusion in BRRBA of 401 million of revenue requirement authorized under GRC track 2 for collection in customer rates starting March 2022 over a 36-month period, a revenue requirement of approximately 400 million authorized under GRC track 3 for collection in customer rates starting October 2022 over a 36-month period, and 174 million CSRP related expenses approved in September 2022. These higher undercollections were partially offset by current year overcollections due to higher sales volume and average rates due to extreme heat in California and recovery of prior year undercollections, including 2021 GRC authorized additional revenue requirement for the first nine months of 2021 to be collected over a 27-month period starting October 2021. Undercollections decreased by 180 million related to wildfire risk mitigation and restoration memorandum and balancing accounts as a result of approval to recover costs in GRC track 2 and track 3, which were transferred to BRRBA for recovery as mentioned above, partially offset by additional WEMA and wildfire risk mitigation and restoration costs incurred. Net undercollections for ERRA, PABA and NSGBA increased by 795 million primarily due to current year undercollections due to higher than forecast energy prices and load, partially offset by higher sales volume and higher average rates driven by extreme heat in California and recovery of prior PABA and NSGBA undercollections. Increased overcollections of 511 million for the public purpose and energy efficiency programs primarily due to lower program spending due to timing and increased sales volume. Net overcollection increased by 178 million for the FERC balancing accounts primarily due to current year overcollections due to higher sales volume, recovery of prior year undercollections and lower operating expenses than amounts included in revenue requirements. Increase in overcollections of 56 million for excess California Department of Water Resources DWR bond and power charges to be refunded to customers over a 12-month period beginning in June 2022. Undercollections in the CSRP memorandum account decreased by 64 million primarily due to transfer 174 million approved expense to BRRBA as mentioned above, partially offset by related deferred CSRP post implementation costs. 
 2021 Net undercollections of BRRBA increased by 227 million primarily driven by adoption of the 2021 GRC final decision, including 2021 authorized revenue requirements to be collected over a 27-month period starting October

 2021, and CEMA drought authorized revenue requirement to be collected over a 12-month period starting October 2021. The undercollections are partially offset by current year overcollection due to higher sales volume, and recovery of prior year undercollections, including WEMA and the Grid Safety and Resiliency Program being collected over a two-year and one-year period, respectively, starting October 2020. Undercollections of 364 million were related to wildfire-related expenses that are probable of future recovery from customers. Undercollections of CEMA accounts decreased by 62 million as a result of approval to recover drought restoration costs, which was transferred to BRRBA for recovery, partially offset by additional restoration costs due to wildfire events in 2020. Net undercollections for ERRA, PABA and the NSGBA increased by 251 million primarily due to current year undercollections as a result of higher gas and power prices, partially offset by higher sales volume, and recovery of prior PABA and NSGBA undercollections. Undercollections from COVID-19-related memorandum and balancing accounts decreased by 82 million due to transfer of 182 million to ERRA and public purpose programs, partially offset by additional customer uncollectible expenses. Undercollections of 98 million in the CSRP memorandum account were related to CSRP implementation costs. 
 Cash flows (used in) or provided by other noncurrent assets and liabilities were primarily related to an increase in wildfire insurance receivables of (398) million in 2022 and an insurance recovery of 708 million in 2021.

Commitments and Contingencies Contingencies. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements SCE has variable interests in power purchase contracts with variable interest entities and a variable interest in unconsolidated Trust II, Trust III, Trust IV, Trust V and Trust VI that issued 400 million (aggregate liquidation preference) of 5.10 , 275 million (aggregate liquidation preference) of 5.75 , 325 million (aggregate liquidation preference) of 5.375 , 300 million (aggregate liquidation preference) of 5.45 and 475 million (aggregate liquidation preference) of 5.00 , trust securities, respectively, to the public. In 2020, SCE Trust II redeemed 180 million of its trust securities from the public, from its issued trust securities of 400 million. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3. Variable Interest Entities. MARKET RISK EXPOSURES Edison International s and SCE s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates, commodity prices and volumes, and counterparty credit. Derivative instruments are used to manage market risks including market risks to SCE s customers. For further discussion of market risk exposures, including commodity price risk, credit risk and interest rate risk, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 6. Derivative Instruments and Note 4. Fair Value Measurements. Interest Rate Risk Edison International and SCE are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of financing, investing and borrowing activities used for liquidity purposes, and to fund business operations and capital investments. The nature and amount of Edison International s and SCE s long-term and short-term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Fluctuations in interest rates can affect earnings and cash flows. Changes in interest rates may impact SCE s authorized rate of return for the period beyond 2023 through a CPUC cost of capital adjustment mechanism, see Liquidity and Capital Resources SCE and Business SCE Overview of Ratemaking Process for further discussion. The following table summarizes the increase or decrease to the fair value of long-term debt including the current portion, if the market interest rates were changed while leaving all other assumptions the same:

 earnings but may impact timing of cash flows. SCE s hedging program is designed to reduce exposure to variability in market prices related to SCE s purchases and sales of electric power and natural gas. As part of this program, SCE enters into energy options, swaps, forward arrangements and congestion revenue rights CRRs ). The transactions are pre-approved by the CPUC or executed in compliance with CPUC-approved procurement plans. Therefore, SCE expects recovery of its related hedging costs, as well as procurement costs, through the ERRA balancing account or CPUC-approved procurement plans. For more details of the ERRA balancing account, see Liquidity and Capital Resources SCE Regulatory Proceedings ERRA Proceeding and Business SCE Overview of Ratemaking Process. Fair Value of Derivative Instruments The fair value of derivative instruments is included in the consolidated balance sheets unless subject to an exception under the applicable accounting guidance. Realized gains and losses from derivative instruments are expected to be recovered from or refunded to customers through regulatory mechanisms and, accordingly, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments have no impact on earnings. SCE does not use hedge accounting for these transactions due to this regulatory accounting treatment. For further discussion on fair value measurements and the fair value hierarchy, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 4. Fair Value Measurements. The fair value of outstanding derivative instruments used to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk was a net asset of 240 million and 44 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The following table summarizes the increase or decrease to the fair values of the net asset of derivative instruments included in the consolidated balance sheets, if the electricity prices or gas prices were changed while leaving all other assumptions constant: 

December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Increase in electricity prices by 10 22 13 Decrease in electricity prices by 10 (22) (13) Increase in gas prices by 10 40 20 Decrease in gas prices by 10 (40) (20) Investment Price Risk Edison International and SCE are subject to investment price risk due to securities held as investments in the nuclear decommissioning trust and various pension and other post-retirement benefit plan trusts. Nuclear Decommissioning Trust As of December 31, 2022, SCE s nuclear decommissioning trust investments consist of equity investments of 1.6 billion and fixed income investments of 2.2 billion. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. SCE s investment policies and CPUC requirements place limitations on the types and investment grade ratings of the securities that may be held by the nuclear decommissioning trust. These policies restrict the trust from holding alternative investments and limit the trust funds exposures to investments in highly illiquid markets. Due to regulatory mechanisms, investment earnings and realized and unrealized gains and losses increase or decrease the trust assets and the related regulatory asset or liability, and do not materially affect earnings. For further discussion on the nuclear decommissioning trust investments, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 4. Fair Value Measurements and Note 10. Investments. PBOP and Pension Plan Assets The PBOP Plan and the Southern California Edison Company Retirement Plan Trust assets include investments in equity securities, U.S. treasury securities, other fixed-income securities, common/collective funds, mutual funds, other investment entities, foreign exchange and interest rate contracts, and partnership/joint ventures. These investments are 
 35 

Table of Contents 
 exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. The investment of plan assets is overseen by a fiduciary investment committee. Risk is managed through diversification among multiple asset classes, managers, styles and securities. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 9. Compensation and Benefit Plans for additional information regarding investment strategy of plan assets. A significant decline in the value of plan assets could require SCE to increase funding of its pension and PBOP plans in future periods, which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods. Annual contributions related to SCE employees made to SCE plans are anticipated to be recovered through CPUC-approved regulatory mechanisms. Credit Risk Credit risk exposure from counterparties for power and gas trading activities is measured as the sum of net accounts receivable (accounts receivable less accounts payable) and the current fair value of net derivative assets (derivative assets less derivative liabilities) reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. SCE enters into master agreements which typically provide for a right of set-off. Accordingly, SCE s credit risk exposure from counterparties is based on a net exposure under these arrangements. SCE manages the credit risk on the portfolio of counterparties based on credit ratings and other publicly disclosed information, such as financial statements, regulatory filings and press releases, to guide it in the process of setting credit levels, risk limits and contractual arrangements, including master netting agreements. Based on SCE s policies and risk exposures related to credit, SCE does not anticipate a material adverse effect on their financial statements as a result of counterparty nonperformance. At December 31, 2022, SCE s power and gas trading counterparty credit risk exposure was 239 million, all of which is associated with entities that have an investment grade rating of A or higher. SCE assigns a credit rating to counterparties based on the lowest of a counterparty s S P s, Moody s and Fitch s rating. For more information related to credit risks, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 6. Derivative Instruments. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES The accounting policies described below are considered critical to obtaining an understanding of Edison International s and SCE s consolidated financial statements because their application requires the use of significant estimates and judgments by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Management estimates and judgments are inherently uncertain and may differ significantly from actual results achieved. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires significant assumptions and changes in the estimate or, the use of alternative estimates, could have a material impact on Edison International s and SCE s results of operations or financial position. For more information on Edison International s and SCE s accounting policies, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Accounting for Contingencies Nature of Estimates Required. Edison International and SCE record loss contingencies when management determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies are recognized in the financial statements when they are realized. Key Assumptions and Approach Used. The determination of an accrual for a loss contingency is based on management judgment and estimates with respect to the likely outcome of the matter, including the analysis of different scenarios. Liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments or estimates to change. In assessing whether a loss is a reasonable possibility, Edison International and SCE may consider the following factors, among others: the nature of the litigation, claim or assessment, available information, opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors, and the experience gained from similar cases. Edison International and SCE provide disclosures for material contingencies when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may be incurred.

Table of Contents 
 Effect if Different Assumptions Used. Actual amounts realized upon settlement of contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on the liabilities, revenue and expenses recorded on the consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of contingencies, guarantees and indemnities, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies. Application to 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events As discussed in Management Overview, wildfires in SCE s territory in December 2017 and November 2018 caused loss of life, substantial damage to both residential and business properties, and service outages for SCE customers. The extent of legal liability for wildfire-related damages in actions against utilities depends on a number of factors, including whether the utility substantially caused or contributed to the damages and whether parties seeking recovery of damages will be required to show negligence in addition to causation. Final determinations of legal liability for wildfire events, including determinations of whether SCE was negligent, would only be made during lengthy and complex litigation processes and settlements may be reached before determinations of legal liability are ever made. Edison International and SCE have incurred material losses in connection with the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. Estimated losses for the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events litigation are based on a number of assumptions and are subject to change as additional information becomes available. Actual losses incurred may be higher or lower than estimated based on several factors, including the uncertainty in estimating damages that have been or may be alleged. For instance, SCE will receive additional information with respect to damages claimed as the claims mediation processes progress. Other factors that can cause actual losses incurred to be higher or lower than estimated include the ability to reach settlements and the outcomes of settlements reached through the ongoing claims mediation processes, uncertainties related to the sufficiency of insurance held by plaintiffs, uncertainties related to the litigation processes, including whether plaintiffs will ultimately pursue claims, uncertainty as to the legal and factual determinations to be made during litigation, including uncertainty as to the contributing causes of the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, the complexities associated with fires that merge and whether inverse condemnation will be held applicable to SCE with respect to damages caused by the Montecito Mudslides, and the uncertainty as to how these factors impact future settlements. Each reporting period, management reviews its loss estimates for remaining alleged and potential claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. Management s 2022 reviews included a review of large damage claims presented by a small number of plaintiffs, new lawsuits filed in the Woolsey Fire litigation and information obtained after the statute of limitations for individual plaintiffs for the Woolsey Fire expired, including information regarding the nature of claims remaining in the Woolsey Fire litigation. Management also reviewed information obtained from settling a substantial portion of the claims in the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events litigations, including higher than expected costs to settle claims. As a result of management s reviews during 2022, SCE recorded a 1.3 billion increase in estimated losses for the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events during the year. In total, through December 31, 2022, SCE has accrued estimated losses of 8.8 billion, has paid or is obligated to pay approximately 7.8 billion in settlements and has recovered 2.0 billion from its insurance carriers and approximately 234 million through FERC-jurisdictional electric rates in relation to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. At December 31, 2022 Edison International s and SCE s best estimate of expected losses for remaining alleged and potential claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events is 934 million. Edison International and SCE may incur a material loss in excess of amounts accrued in connection with the remaining alleged and potential claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. Due to the number of uncertainties and possible outcomes related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events litigation, Edison International and SCE cannot estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible losses that may be incurred.

Table of Contents 
 Rate Regulated Enterprises Nature of Estimate Required. SCE follows the accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises which are required for entities whose rates are set by regulators at levels intended to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investment, or rate base. Regulators may also impose penalties or grant incentives. Due to timing and other differences in the collection of revenue, these principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by an unregulated entity to be capitalized as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates; conversely the principles allow creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and refundable to customers. In addition, SCE recognizes revenue and regulatory assets from alternative revenue programs, which enables the utility to adjust future rates in response to past activities or completed events, if certain criteria are met, even for programs that do not qualify for recognition of traditional regulatory assets and liabilities. Accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises also require recognition of an impairment loss if it becomes probable that the regulated utility will abandon a plant investment, or if it becomes probable that the cost of a recently completed plant will be disallowed, either directly or indirectly, for ratemaking purposes and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. Key Assumptions and Approach Used. SCE s management assesses at the end of each reporting period whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as the current regulatory environment, the issuance of rate orders on recovery of the specific or a similar incurred cost to SCE or other rate-regulated entities, and other factors that would indicate that the regulator will treat an incurred cost as allowable for ratemaking purposes. Using these factors, management has determined that existing regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or settlement. This determination reflects the current regulatory climate and is subject to change in the future. SCE also considers whether any plant investments are probable of abandonment or disallowance. Effect if Different Assumptions Used. Significant management judgment is required to evaluate the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets and plant investments, the recognition of incentives and revenue subject to refund, as well as the anticipated cost of regulatory liabilities or penalties. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, all or part of the regulatory assets, plant investments and/or liabilities would have to be written off against current period earnings. At December 31, 2022, the consolidated balance sheets included regulatory assets of 10.7 billion and regulatory liabilities of 9.2 billion. If different judgments were reached on recovery of costs and timing of income recognition, SCE s earnings may vary from the amounts reported. Application to Southern California Wildfires Application to 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events Recovery of SCE s losses realized in connection with the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events in excess of available insurance is subject to approval by regulators. Under accounting standards for rate-regulated enterprises, SCE defers costs as regulatory assets when it concludes that such costs are probable of future recovery in electric rates. SCE utilizes objectively determinable evidence to form its view on probability of future recovery. The only directly comparable precedent in which a California investor-owned utility has sought recovery for uninsured wildfire-related costs is SDG E s requests for cost recovery related to 2007 wildfire activity, where the FERC allowed recovery of all FERC-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs while the CPUC rejected recovery of all CPUC-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs based on a determination that SDG E did not meet the CPUC s prudency standard. As a result, while SCE does not agree with the CPUC s decision, it believes that the CPUC s interpretation and application of the prudency standard to SDG E creates substantial uncertainty regarding how that standard will be applied to an investor-owned utility in wildfire cost-recovery proceedings for fires ignited prior to July 12, 2019. SCE will continue to evaluate the probability of recovery based on available evidence, including judicial, legislative and regulatory decisions, including any CPUC 
 38

 decisions illustrating the interpretation and/or application of the prudency standard when making determinations regarding recovery of uninsured wildfire-related costs. While the CPUC has not made a determination regarding SCE s prudency relative to any of the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, SCE is unable to conclude, at this time, that uninsured CPUC-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs are probable of recovery through electric rates. SCE would record a regulatory asset at the time it obtains sufficient information to support a conclusion that recovery is probable. Through the operation of its FERC Formula Rate, and based upon the precedent established in SDG E s recovery of FERC-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs, SCE believes it is probable it will recover its FERC-jurisdictional wildfire and mudslide related costs and has recorded total expected recoveries within the FERC balancing account. Application to Post-2018 Wildfires Management judgment was required to assess the probability of recovery of SCE s losses realized in connection with the Post-2018 Wildfires in excess of available insurance. The CPUC and FERC may not allow SCE to recover uninsured losses through electric rates if it is determined that such losses were not reasonably or prudently incurred. On July 12, 2019, AB 1054 clarified that the CPUC must allow recovery of costs and expenses arising from a covered wildfire if the utility s conduct related to the ignition was consistent with actions that a reasonable utility would have undertaken in good faith under similar circumstances, at the relevant point in time, and based on the information available at that time. Further, utilities with a valid safety certification at the time of the relevant wildfire will be presumed to have acted prudently related to a wildfire ignition unless a party in the cost recovery proceeding creates serious doubt as to the reasonableness of the utility s conduct, at which time, the burden shifts back to the utility to dispel that doubt and prove its conduct was prudent. The serious doubt standard in AB 1054 is modeled after the FERC cost recovery standard. SCE evaluates the probability of recovery for Post-2018 Wildfires in the context of the prudency standard laid out by AB 1054 above. This assessment is made based on SCE s status as a holder of a valid safety certificate, facts known to date related to the ignition, and any regulatory decisions illustrating the interpretation and/or application of the prudency standard under AB 1054, which as of December 31, 2022 has not been applied by the CPUC to an actual cost recovery application filed by any California investor-owned utility. SCE also considers which costs are eligible for recovery based on precedents from other CPUC cost recovery proceedings. Management s assessment of the probability of recovery may change, related to changes in any of these factors in the future. Income Taxes Nature of Estimates Required. As part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements, Edison International and SCE are required to estimate income taxes for each jurisdiction in which they operate. This process involves estimating actual current period tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within Edison International s and SCE s consolidated balance sheets, including net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether deferred tax assets can and will be utilized in future periods. Based on currently enacted tax laws, Edison International expects to generate sufficient taxable income beginning in 2023 to fully utilize all loss and credit carryovers set to expire beyond 2022. Edison International and SCE take certain tax positions they believe are in accordance with the applicable tax laws. However, these tax positions are subject to interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service, state tax authorities and the courts. Edison International and SCE determine uncertain tax positions in accordance with the authoritative guidance. Key Assumptions and Approach Used. In determining whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can be utilized, management analyzes the trend of GAAP earnings and then 
 39 

Table of Contents 
 estimates the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies based on currently enacted tax laws. Accounting for tax obligations requires management judgment. Edison International s and SCE s management use judgment in determining whether the evidence indicates it is more likely than not, based solely on the technical merits, that a tax position will be sustained, and to determine the amount of tax benefits to be recognized. Judgment is also used in determining the likelihood a tax position will be settled and possible settlement outcomes. In assessing uncertain tax positions Edison International and SCE consider, among others, the following factors: the facts and circumstances of the position, regulations, rulings, and case law, opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, and the experience gained from similar tax positions. Edison International and SCE evaluate uncertain tax positions at the end of each reporting period and make adjustments when warranted based on changes in fact or law. Effect if Different Assumptions Used. Should a change in facts or circumstances, including a change in enacted tax legislation, lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset, Edison International and SCE would record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes. Actual income taxes may differ from the estimated amounts which could have a significant impact on the liabilities, revenue and expenses recorded in the financial statements. Edison International and SCE continue to be under audit or subject to audit for multiple years in various jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of particular tax positions that involve interpretations of complex tax laws. Such liabilities are based on judgment and a final determination could take many years from the time the liability is recorded. Furthermore, settlement of tax positions included in open tax years may be resolved by compromises of tax positions based on current factors and business considerations that may result in material adjustments to income taxes previously estimated. For a discussion of current and deferred taxes, net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, unrecognized tax benefits, and tax disputes, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 8. Income Taxes. Nuclear Decommissioning Asset Retirement Obligation Key Assumptions and Approach Used. San Onofre Units 1, 2 and 3 decommissioning cost estimates are updated in each Nuclear Decommissioning Cost Triennial Proceeding NDCTP and when there are material changes to the timing or amount of estimated future cash flows. Palo Verde decommissioning cost estimates are updated by the operating agent, Arizona Public Services, every three years and when there are material changes to the timing or amount of estimated future cash flows. SCE estimates that it will spend approximately 6.3 billion, undiscounted through 2080, to decommission its nuclear facilities. The current ARO estimates for San Onofre and Palo Verde are based on: Decommissioning Costs. The estimated costs for labor, material, equipment and other, and low-level radioactive waste costs are included in each of the NRC decommissioning stages: license termination, site restoration and spent fuel storage. The liability to decommission SCE s nuclear power facilities is based on a 2020 decommissioning study, filed as part of the 2021 NDCTP, for San Onofre Unit 1, 2 and 3 and a 2019 decommissioning study for Palo Verde, with revisions to the cost estimate in 2020. Escalation Rates. Annual escalation rates are used to convert the decommissioning cost estimates in base year dollars to decommissioning cost estimates in future-year dollars. Escalation rates are primarily used for labor, material, equipment and low-level radioactive waste burial costs. SCE s current estimates are based upon SCE s decommissioning cost methodology used for ratemaking purposes. Average escalation rates range from 2.3 to 7.5 (depending on the cost element) annually. 
 40 

Table of Contents 
 Timing. Initial decommissioning activities at San Onofre Unit 1 started in 1999 and at Units 2 and 3 in 2013. Cost estimates for San Onofre Units are currently based on completion of decommissioning activities by 2053. Cost estimates for Palo Verde are based on an assumption that decommissioning will commence promptly after the current NRC operating licenses expire. The Palo Verde 1, 2, 3 operating licenses currently expire in 2045, 2046 and 2047, respectively. Spent Fuel Dry Storage Costs. Cost estimates, including the impact of escalations, are based on an assumption that the U.S. Department of Energy will begin to take spent fuel from the nuclear industry in 2031 and will remove the last spent fuel from the San Onofre and Palo Verde sites by 2051 and 2078, respectively. Changes in Decommissioning Technology, Regulation and Economics. The current cost studies assume the use of current technologies under current regulations and at current cost levels. 
 See Liquidity and Capital Resources SCE Decommissioning of San Onofre for further discussion of the plans for decommissioning of San Onofre. Effect if Different Assumptions Used. The ARO for decommissioning SCE s nuclear facilities was 2.3 billion as of December 31, 2022, based on the decommissioning studies performed and the subsequent cost estimate updates. Changes in the estimated costs, execution strategy or timing of decommissioning, or in the assumptions and judgments by management underlying these estimates, could cause material revisions to the estimated total cost to decommission these facilities which could have a material effect on the recorded liability. The following table illustrates the increase to the ARO liability if the cost escalation rate was adjusted while leaving all other assumptions constant: 

Increase to ARO at (in millions) December 31, 2022 Uniform increase in escalation rate of 1 percentage point 584 The increase in the ARO liability driven by an increase in the escalation rate would result in a decrease in the regulatory liability for recoveries in excess of ARO liabilities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions Nature of Estimate Required. Authoritative accounting guidance requires companies to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as assets and liabilities in the balance sheet; the assets and/or liabilities are normally offset through other comprehensive income (loss). In accordance with authoritative guidance for rate-regulated enterprises, regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded instead of charges and credits to other comprehensive income (loss) for its postretirement benefit plans that are recoverable in utility rates. Edison International and SCE have a fiscal year-end measurement date for all of their postretirement plans. Key Assumptions of Approach Used. Pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the related effects on results of operations are calculated using actuarial models. Two critical assumptions, discount rate and expected return on assets, are important elements of plan expense, and the discount rate is important to liability measurement. Additionally, health care cost trend rates are critical assumptions for postretirement health care plans. These critical assumptions are evaluated at least annually. Other assumptions, which require management judgment, such as rate of compensation increases and rates of retirement and turnover, are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect actual experience. As of December 31, 2022, Edison International s and SCE s pension plans had a 3.5 billion and 3.2 billion projected benefit obligation, respectively, and total 2022 expense for these plans was 19 million and 16 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the accumulated benefit obligation for both Edison International s and SCE s PBOP plans were 
 41 

Table of Contents 
 1.3 billion, and total 2022 expense for Edison International s PBOP plan were 1 million, and no expense for SCE s PBOP plan. Annual contributions made to most of SCE s pension and PBOP plan are anticipated to be recovered through CPUC-approved regulatory mechanisms and are expected to be, at a minimum, equal to the related annual expense. Pension expense is recorded for SCE based on the amount funded to the trusts, as calculated using an actuarial method required for ratemaking purposes, in which the impact of market volatility on plan assets is recognized in earnings on a more gradual basis. Any difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with ratemaking methods and pension expense calculated in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance for pension is accumulated as a regulatory asset or liability, and is expected, over time, to be recovered from or returned to customers. As of December 31, 2022, this cumulative difference amounted to 63 million, meaning that the ratemaking method has recognized less in expense than the accounting method since implementation of authoritative guidance for employers accounting for pensions in 1987, which was offset by a regulatory liability for the current funding level of SCE s pension plan. Edison International and SCE used the following critical assumptions to determine expense for pension and PBOP for 2022: 

Postretirement Pension Benefits Other (in millions) Plans than Pensions Discount rate 1 2.75 2.95 Expected long-term return on plan assets 2 5.50 3.50 Assumed health care cost trend rates 3 6.25 Not applicable to pension plans. 
 1 The discount rate enables Edison International and SCE to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date. Edison International and SCE select its discount rate by performing a yield curve analysis. This analysis determines the equivalent discount rate on projected cash flows by matching the timing and amount of expected future benefit payments to the corresponding yields from the Willis Towers Watson RATE: Link 10 th 90 th percentile yield curve model on the measurement date. 2 To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, current and expected asset allocations are considered, as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets. A portion of PBOP trusts asset returns are subject to taxation, so the 3.50 rate of return on plan assets above is determined on an after-tax basis. Actual time-weighted, annualized returns on the pension plan assets were (13.4) , 5.1 and 7.4 for the one-year, five-year and ten-year periods ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Actual time-weighted, annualized returns on the PBOP plan assets were (18.9) , 2.1 and 5.8 over these same periods. Accounting principles provide that differences between expected and actual returns are recognized over the average future service of employees. 3 The health care cost trend rate gradually declines to 5.0 for 2029 and beyond. 
 As of December 31, 2022, Edison International and SCE had unrecognized pension gains of 122 million and 131 million, respectively, and unrecognized PBOP gains of 869 million and 867 million, respectively. The unrecognized pension and PBOP gains primarily consisted of the cumulative impact of the increased discount rates on the respective benefit obligations and the cumulative difference between the expected and actual rate of return on plan assets. Of these deferred gains, 139 million of SCE s pension gains and 867 million of SCE s PBOP gains are recorded as regulatory liabilities, respectively, and are expected to refund over the average expected future service of employees. Edison International s and SCE s pension and PBOP plans are subject to limits established for federal tax deductibility. SCE funds its pension and PBOP plans in accordance with amounts allowed by the CPUC. Executive pension plans have no plan assets.

Table of Contents 
 Effect if Different Assumptions Used. Changes in the estimated costs or timing of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, or the assumptions and judgments used by management underlying these estimates, could have a material effect on the recorded expenses and liabilities. The following table summarizes the increase or decrease to projected benefit obligation for pension and the accumulated benefit obligation for PBOP if the discount rate were changed while leaving all other assumptions constant: 

Edison International SCE Increase in Decrease in Increase in Decrease in discount rate discount rate discount rate discount rate (in millions) by 1 by 1 by 1 by 1 Change to projected benefit obligation for pension (135) 158 (108) 126 Change to accumulated benefit obligation for PBOP (142) 174 (141) 173 A one percentage point increase in the expected rate of return on pension plan assets would decrease Edison International s and SCE s current year expense by 33 million and 31 million, respectively, and a one percentage point increase in the expected rate of return on PBOP plan assets would decrease both Edison International s and SCE s current year expense by 21 million. Contributions to the Wildfire Insurance Fund Nature of Estimates Required. At December 31, 2022, Edison International and SCE have a 2.2 billion long-term asset and a 204 million current asset reflected as Wildfire Insurance Fund contributions in the consolidated balance sheets for the initial 2.4 billion contribution made during 2019 and the present value of annual contributions SCE committed to make to the Wildfire Insurance Fund, reduced by amortization. At December 31, 2022, a long-term liability of 536 million has been reflected in Other deferred credits and other long-term liabilities for the present value of unpaid contribution amounts. Contributions were discounted to the present value at the date SCE committed to participate in the Wildfire Insurance Fund using US treasury interest rates. Management concluded it would be most appropriate to account for the contributions to the Wildfire Insurance Fund similar to prepaid insurance, ratably allocating the expense to periods based on an estimated period of coverage. Key Assumptions and Approach Used. The Wildfire Insurance Fund does not have a defined life. Instead, the Wildfire Insurance Fund will terminate when the administrator determines that the fund has been exhausted. In 2022, management estimated that the Wildfire Insurance Fund will provide insurance coverage for a period of 15 years from the date SCE committed to participate in the Wildfire Insurance Fund. The determination of the correct period in which to record an expense in relation to contributions to the Wildfire Insurance Fund depends, among other factors, on management s assessment of: the future occurrence and magnitude of wildfires; the involvement of SCE, or other electrical corporations which could access the Wildfire Insurance Fund, in the ignition of those fires; the probable future outcomes of CPUC cost recovery proceedings for wildfire claims, which may require reimbursement of the fund by electrical corporations; and the use of the contributions by the administrator of the Wildfire Insurance Fund. Further information regarding these factors may become available due to the actions of the fund administrator, or other entities, which could require management to reassess the period of coverage. In estimating the period of coverage, Edison International and SCE used Monte Carlo simulations based on eight years (2014 2021) of historical data from wildfires caused by electrical utility equipment to estimate expected loss. The details of the operation of the Wildfire Insurance Fund and estimates related to claims by SCE, PG E and SDG E against the fund have been applied to the expected loss simulations to estimate the period of coverage of the fund. The most sensitive inputs to the estimated period of coverage are the expected frequency of wildfire events caused by investor-owned utility electrical equipment and the estimated costs associated with those forecasted events. These inputs are most affected by the historical data used in estimating expected losses. Using a 15-year period (2007 2021) of historical data would increase the period of coverage to over 20 years.

Table of Contents 
 Based on information available in the first quarter of 2023 regarding catastrophic wildfires during 2022, SCE reassessed its estimate of the life of the Wildfire Insurance Fund. After incorporating 2022 expected losses into the historical data for the Monte Carlo simulations, SCE determined the expected life of the Wildfire Insurance Fund remained 15 years from the date SCE committed to participate in the Wildfire Insurance Fund. Effect if Different Assumptions Used. Changes in the estimated life of the insurance fund could have a material impact on the expense recognition. NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE New accounting guidance is discussed in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies New Accounting Guidance. RISK FACTORS RISKS RELATING TO EDISON INTERNATIONAL Edison International s liquidity and ability to pay dividends depends on its ability to borrow funds, access to bank and capital markets, monetization of tax benefits held by Edison International, and SCE s ability to pay dividends and tax allocation payments to Edison International. Edison International is a holding company and, as such, it has no material operations of its own. Edison International s ability to meet its financial obligations, make investments, and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of SCE and SCE s ability to make upstream distributions. If SCE does not make upstream distributions to Edison International and Edison International is unable to access the bank and capital markets on reasonable terms, Edison International may be unable to continue to pay dividends to its shareholders or meet its financial obligations. Prior to paying dividends to Edison International, SCE has financial and regulatory obligations that must be satisfied, including, among others, debt service and preference stock dividends. Further, SCE and Edison International cannot pay dividends if California law requirements for the declaration of dividends are not met. For information on CPUC and California law requirements related to the declaration of dividends, see Liquidity and Capital Resources SCE SCE Dividends in the MD A. SCE may also owe tax-allocation payments to Edison International under applicable tax-allocation agreements. Edison International s ability to obtain financing, as well as its ability to refinance debt and make scheduled payments of principal and interest, are dependent on numerous factors, including its levels of indebtedness, maintenance of acceptable credit ratings, financial performance, liquidity and cash flow, and other market conditions. In addition, the factors affecting SCE s business will impact Edison International s ability to obtain financing. Edison International s inability to borrow funds from time to time could have a material effect on Edison International s liquidity and operations. See Risks Relating to Southern California Edison Company below for further discussion. RISKS RELATING TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON COMPANY Regulatory and Legislative Risks SCE s financial results depend upon its ability to recover its costs and to earn a reasonable rate of return on capital investments in a timely manner from its customers through regulated rates. SCE s ongoing financial results depend on its ability to recover its costs from its customers, including the costs of electricity purchased for its customers, through the rates it charges its customers as approved by the CPUC and FERC. SCE s financial results also depend on its ability to earn a reasonable return on capital, including long-term debt and 
 44 

Table of Contents 
 equity. SCE s ability to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return can be affected by many factors, including the time lag between when costs are incurred and when those costs are recovered in customers rates and differences between the forecast or authorized costs embedded in rates (which are set on a prospective basis) and the amount of actual costs incurred. The CPUC or the FERC may not allow SCE to recover costs on the basis that such costs were not reasonably or prudently incurred or for other reasons. Further, SCE may incur expenses before the relevant regulatory agency approves the recovery of such costs. For example, SCE has incurred, and expects to further incur, wildfire mitigation expenses and increased labor and material costs due to supply chain constraints and elevated levels of inflation before it is clear whether such costs will be recoverable from customers. Also, the CPUC may deny recovery of costs incurred by SCE, including uninsured wildfire-related costs, if the CPUC determines that SCE was not prudent. For further information on recovery of uninsured wildfire-related costs, including costs related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, see Business Southern California Wildfires Recovery of Wildfire-Related Costs and Management Overview Southern California Wildfires and Mudslides in the MD A. In addition, while SCE supports California s environmental goals, it may be prevented from fully executing on its strategy to support such goals by regulatory delay or lack of approval of cost-recovery for the costs of such strategic actions and electrification programs from the relevant regulatory agencies. SCE s authorized return on investment is established by multiplying an authorized rate of return, determined by the CPUC in standalone cost of capital proceedings, by SCE s authorized CPUC rate base. SCE s CPUC-authorized cost of capital is subject to potential adjustment should interest rates move substantially in years between cost of capital proceedings. For further information on the cost of capital mechanism see Management Overview Cost of Capital Applications in the MD A. SCE s capital investment plan, increasing procurement of renewable power and energy storage, inflation, commodity price volatility, increasing self-generation, load departures to CCAs or Electric Service Providers, and increasing environmental regulations, among other things, collectively place continuing upward pressure on customer rates. If customer rates continue to increase, the CPUC may face greater pressure to approve lesser amounts in SCE s ratemaking or cost recovery proceedings. To relieve some of this upward rate pressure, the CPUC may authorize lower revenues or increase the period over which SCE is allowed to recover amounts, which could impact SCE s ability to timely recover its operating costs. For example, in track 3 of the 2021 GRC, while the CPUC authorized SCE to recover costs through electric rates over a 36-month period, SCE may not recover all of its interest expense incurred as a result of financing such costs because the CPUC has only authorized interest accruals on the balances at a short-term rate of interest. If SCE is unable to obtain a sufficient rate increase or modify its rate design to recover its costs and an adequate return on capital in rates in a timely manner, its financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected. SCE is subject to extensive regulation and the risk of adverse regulatory and legislative decisions, delays in regulatory or legislative decisions, and changes in applicable regulations or legislation. SCE operates in a highly regulated environment. SCE s business is subject to extensive federal, state and local energy, environmental and other laws and regulations. Among other things, the CPUC regulates SCE s retail rates and capital structure, and the FERC regulates SCE s wholesale rates and capital structure. The NRC regulates the decommissioning of San Onofre in addition to the local and state agencies that require permits. The construction, planning, siting and operation of SCE s power plants, energy storage projects, and transmission lines in California are also subject to regulation by the CPUC and other local, state and federal agencies. SCE must periodically apply for licenses and permits from these various regulatory authorities, including environmental regulatory authorities, and must abide by their respective rules, regulations and orders. Should SCE be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits or should these regulatory authorities initiate any investigations or enforcement 
 45 

Table of Contents 
 actions or impose fines, penalties or disallowances on SCE, SCE may be prevented from executing its strategy and its business could be materially affected. The process of obtaining licenses and permits from regulatory authorities may be delayed or defeated by opponents and such delay or defeat could have a material effect on SCE s business. To the extent the Wildfire Insurance Fund and other provisions of AB 1054 do not effectively mitigate the significant risk faced by California investor-owned utilities related to liability for damages arising from catastrophic wildfires where utility facilities are a substantial cause, not achieving a more comprehensive solution could have a detrimental effect on SCE s business and financial condition. The effectiveness of AB 1054 to mitigate the wildfire-related risk faced by SCE is conditioned in part on the performance of OEIS and various entities formed under AB 1054 and related legislation to, among other things, administer the Wildfire Insurance Fund, approve WMPs, issue safety certifications, oversee and enforce compliance with wildfire safety standards, and develop metrics to reduce risk and measure compliance with risk reduction. In addition, CPUC approval is required to recover the costs SCE is incurring to strengthen its wildfire mitigation and prevention efforts described in SCE s WMPs. See Business Southern California Wildfires and Liquidity and Capital Resources SCE Regulatory Proceedings Wildfire Related Regulatory Proceedings in the MD A. In addition, existing regulations may be revised or re-interpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to SCE, or its facilities or operations, in a manner that may have a detrimental effect on SCE s business or result in significant additional costs. In addition, regulations adopted via the public initiative or legislative process may apply to SCE, or its facilities or operations, in a manner that may have a detrimental effect on SCE s business or result in significant additional costs. SCE s energy procurement activities are subject to regulatory and market risks that could materially affect its financial condition and liquidity. SCE obtains energy, capacity, environmental credits and ancillary services needed to serve its customers from its own generating plants and through contracts with energy producers and sellers. California law and CPUC decisions allow SCE to recover, through the rates it is allowed to charge its customers, reasonable procurement costs incurred in compliance with an approved procurement plan. Nonetheless, SCE s cash flows remain subject to volatility primarily resulting from changes in commodity prices, including as a result of gas supply constraints. Additionally, significant and prolonged gas use restrictions may adversely impact the reliability of the electric grid if critical generation resources are limited in their operations. For further information, see Business SCE Purchased Power and Fuel Supply. SCE is also subject to the risks of unfavorable or untimely CPUC decisions about the compliance with SCE s procurement plan and the reasonableness of certain procurement-related costs. SCE may not be able to hedge its risk for commodities on economic terms or fully recover the costs of hedges through the rates it is allowed to charge its customers, which could materially affect SCE s liquidity and results of operations, see Market Risk Exposures in the MD A. Operating Risks Damage claims against SCE for wildfire-related losses may materially affect SCE s financial condition and results of operations. Prolonged drought conditions and shifting weather patterns in California resulting from climate change as well as, among other things, buildup of dry vegetation in areas severely impacted by years of historic drought and lack of adequate clearing of hazardous fuels by responsible parties have increased the duration of the wildfire season and the risk of severe wildfire events. Severe wildfires and increased urban development in high fire risk areas in California have given rise to large damage claims against California utilities for fire-related losses alleged to be the result of utility practices and/or the failure of 
 46 

Table of Contents 
 electric and other utility equipment. Catastrophic wildfires can occur in SCE s service territory even if SCE effectively implements its WMPs. California courts have previously found utilities to be strictly liable for property damage, regardless of fault, by applying the theory of inverse condemnation when a utility s facilities were determined to be a substantial cause of a wildfire that caused the property damage. The rationale generally stated by these courts for applying this theory to investor-owned utilities is that property losses resulting from a public improvement, such as the distribution of electricity, can be spread across the larger community that benefited from such improvement. However, in November 2017, the CPUC issued a decision denying an investor-owned utility s request to include in its rates uninsured wildfire-related costs arising from several 2007 fires, finding that the investor-owned utility did not prudently manage and operate its facilities prior to or at the outset of the 2007 wildfires. An inability to recover uninsured wildfire-related costs could materially affect SCE s business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, if SCE is unable to, or believes that it may be unable to, recover damages related to catastrophic wildfires through insurance, the Wildfire Insurance Fund (which is only available for fires ignited after July 12, 2019) or electric rates, or access the bank and capital markets on reasonable terms, SCE may not have sufficient cash or equity to pay dividends or may be restricted from declaring such dividends because it does not meet CPUC or California law requirements related to the declaration of dividends. For information on the California law requirements on the declaration of dividends, see Liquidity and Capital Resources SCE SCE Dividends in the MD A. Also see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies Contingencies Southern California Wildfires and Mudslides. Edison International s and SCE s costs of accessing capital markets has increased due to the risks associated with wildfires in Southern California. Edison International s and SCE s access to the bank and capital markets could also be constrained and/or the costs of accessing those markets could increase further as a result of wildfire risk, including if Edison International s and/or SCE s credit ratings are downgraded or placed on negative watch due to concerns about Edison International and/or SCE s financial health as a result of wildfires. SCE s insurance coverage for wildfires may not be sufficient. Edison International has experienced increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could arise in connection with SCE s ordinary operations. Edison International, SCE and its contractors may experience coverage reductions and/or increased wildfire insurance costs in future years. No assurance can be given that losses will not exceed the limits of SCE s or its contractors insurance coverage. SCE may not be able to recover uninsured losses (including amounts paid for self-insured retention and co-insurance) and increases in the cost of insurance in electric rates. Losses which are not fully insured or cannot be recovered through the Wildfire Insurance Fund or electric rates could materially affect Edison International s and SCE s financial condition and results of operations. For more information on wildfire insurance risk, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies Contingencies Southern California Wildfires and Mudslides. SCE may not effectively implement its wildfire mitigation plans. SCE will face a higher likelihood of catastrophic wildfires in its service territory if it cannot effectively implement its WMPs. For example, SCE may not be able to effectively implement its WMPs if it experiences unanticipated difficulties relative to sourcing, engaging, and retaining effectively trained contract workers or procuring materials it needs to fulfill its mitigation obligations under the WMPs. In addition, if SCE does not have an approved WMP, SCE will not be issued a safety certification from the CPUC and will consequently not benefit from the presumption of prudency or the AB 1054 Liability Cap. The CPUC may assess penalties on SCE if it finds that SCE has failed to substantially comply with its WMP. In addition, SCE may be subject to mandated changes to, or restrictions on, its operational wildfire mitigation practices or be subject to regulatory fines and penalties or claims for damages and reputational harm if SCE does not execute its wildfire mitigation practices in compliance with applicable rules and regulations. SCE s wildfire mitigation practices 
 47 

Table of Contents 
 include PSPS and using fast-curve settings. In addition, SCE may be subject to regulatory fines and penalties or claims for damages and reputational harm if it is determined that SCE has placed excessive or unreasonable reliance on PSPS. SCE establishes the criteria under which it implements PSPS in its territory. To the extent SCE s criteria for implementing PSPS are not sufficient to mitigate the risk of wildfires during high wind events, SCE does not fully implement PSPS when criteria are met due to other overriding conditions or SCE s regulators or others mandate changes to, or restrictions on, its criteria or other operational PSPS practices, SCE will face a higher likelihood of catastrophic wildfires in its territory during high wind events. Similarly, if SCE is prohibited from implementing its desired fast-curve settings, SCE will face a higher likelihood of catastrophic wildfires in its territory. For more information on AB 1054, see Business Southern California Wildfires Recovery of Wildfire-Related Costs 2019 Wildfire Legislation. SCE will not benefit from all of the features of AB 1054 if the Wildfire Insurance Fund is exhausted. Catastrophic wildfires could rapidly exhaust the Wildfire Insurance Fund and SCE will not be reimbursed by the Wildfire Insurance Fund or benefit from the AB 1054 Liability Cap if the fund has been exhausted as a result of damage claims previously incurred by SCE or the other participating utilities. For more information on AB 1054, see Business Southern California Wildfires and Mudslides Recovery of Wildfire-Related Costs 2019 Wildfire Legislation. Climate change exacerbated weather-related incidents and other natural disasters could materially affect SCE s financial condition and results of operations. Weather-related incidents, including storms and events caused, or exacerbated, by climate change, such as wildfires, flooding and debris flows, and other natural disasters such as earthquakes can disrupt the generation and transmission of electricity, and can seriously damage the infrastructure necessary to deliver power to SCE s customers. The impacts of climate change continue to evolve and remain dynamic and unpredictable. Climate change has caused, and exacerbated, extreme weather events and wildfires in southern California, and wildfires could cause, among other things, public safety issues, property damage and operational issues. In addition, the risk of flooding and debris flows occurring as a result of rain may be heightened. For example, the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events resulted in, among other things, loss of life, property damage and loss of service. For more information on the impact of the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events on SCE and Edison International, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies Contingencies Southern California Wildfires and Mudslides. Extreme heat events can lead to prolonged widespread outages due to, among other things, state-wide capacity supply shortages or equipment failure. Extreme weather events can also lead to use of PSPS. Weather-related events, such as debris flows, flooding and melting of a significantly higher than normal snowpack, and earthquakes can cause over-topping or failure at an SCE dam resulting in a rapid release of water that could cause, among other things, public safety issues, property damage and operational issues. Weather-related incidents and other natural disasters can lead to lost revenue and increased expense, including higher maintenance and repair costs, which SCE may not be able to recover from its customers. These incidents can also result in regulatory penalties and disallowances, particularly if SCE encounters difficulties in restoring power to its customers on a timely basis or if fire-related losses are found to be the result of utility practices and/or the failure of electric and other utility equipment. In addition, these occurrences could lead to significant claims for damages, including for loss of life and property damage. These occurrences could materially affect SCE s business, financial condition and results of 
 48 

Table of Contents 
 operations, and the inability to restore power to SCE s customers could also materially damage the business reputation of SCE and Edison International. For additional information related to climate related risks, see Business Environmental Considerations Environmental Risks. The generation, transmission and distribution of electricity are dangerous and involve inherent risks of damage to private property and injury to SCE s workforce and the general public. Electricity poses hazards for SCE s workforce and the general public should they come in contact with electrical current or equipment, including through energized downed power lines or if equipment malfunctions. In addition, the risks associated with the operation of transmission and distribution assets and power generation and storage facilities include public and workforce safety issues and the risk of utility assets causing or contributing to wildfires. Injuries and property damage caused by such events can subject SCE to liability that, despite the existence of insurance coverage, can be significant. In addition, SCE may be held responsible for the actions of its contractors. No assurance can be given that future losses will not exceed the limits of SCE s or its contractors insurance coverage. The CPUC has increased its focus on public safety with an emphasis on heightened compliance with construction and operating standards and the potential for penalties being imposed on utilities. Additionally, the CPUC has delegated to its staff the authority to issue citations to electric utilities, which can impose fines of up to 100,000 per violation per day (capped at a maximum of 8 million), pursuant to the CPUC s jurisdiction for violations of safety rules found in statutes, regulations, and the CPUC s General Orders. The CPUC also can issue fines greater than 8 million outside of the citation program. Such penalties and liabilities could be significant and materially affect SCE s liquidity and results of operations. SCE s financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected if it is unable to successfully manage the risks inherent in constructing, operating, and maintaining its facilities and workforce. SCE s infrastructure is aging and could pose a risk to system reliability. SCE is also constructing utility owned storage to mitigate possible state-wide capacity shortages in 2023 and later years, and any delays in construction may result in those facilities being unavailable to reduce the impact of any capacity shortages in summer 2023. In addition, as described above, wildfires in SCE s service territory can cause significant public safety issues, property damage and operational issues. In order to mitigate these risks, SCE is engaged in a significant and ongoing infrastructure investment program. This substantial investment program has inherent operational risks and elevates the need for superior execution in SCE s activities. SCE s financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected if it is unable to successfully manage these risks as well as the risks inherent in constructing, operating, and maintaining its facilities, the operation of which can be hazardous and important for system reliability. SCE s inherent operating risks include such matters as the risks of human performance, workforce capabilities, contractor management, data and records accuracy, public opposition to infrastructure projects, delays, environmental remediation and mitigation costs, difficulty in estimating costs or in recovering costs that are above original estimates, system limitations and degradation, maintaining physical security of workforce and assets, maintaining cybersecurity of data and assets, and delays and interruptions in necessary supplies, including key components necessary for the timely construction of utility owned storage. For example, SCE s financial condition may be materially affected as a result of safety incidents, delays, permitting violations and violations of regulatory requirements, among other things, caused by SCE s failure to appropriately manage its contractor workforce or from contractual violations by SCE s contractors and the inability for SCE to recover through contractual indemnities or insurance held by the contractor. SCE s financial condition may also be materially affected as a result of data or records inaccuracies, for example inaccurate records could lead to missing or delayed compliance with SCE s policies and regulatory requirements, and could contribute to safety incidents. SCE s financial condition and results of 
 49 

Table of Contents 
 operations could also be materially affected if SCE is unable to attract, train and retain a qualified and diverse workforce, including due to the constrained labor market in California and nationally and SCE s relations with its unionized workforce. SCE s financial condition and results of operations could also be materially affected as a result of atypical resolutions to litigation proceedings arising from its operations, including atypical settlements and verdicts. For instance, SCE was subject to an atypical jury verdict in a recent employment litigation matter. There are inherent risks associated with owning and decommissioning nuclear power generation facilities and obtaining cost reimbursement, including, among other things, insufficiency of nuclear decommissioning trust funds, costs exceeding current estimates, execution risks, potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and the hazards of storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials. Existing insurance and ratemaking arrangements may not protect SCE fully against losses from a nuclear incident. SCE funds decommissioning costs with assets that are currently held in nuclear decommissioning trusts. Based upon the financial performance of the nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments, as well as the resolution of a number of other uncertainties, assumptions and estimates, additional contributions to the nuclear decommissioning trust s funds may be required. If additional contributions to the nuclear decommissioning trust funds become necessary, recovery of any such additional funds through electric rates is subject to the CPUC s review and approval. The costs of decommissioning San Onofre are subject to reasonableness reviews by the CPUC. These costs may not be recoverable through regulatory processes or otherwise unless SCE can establish that the costs were reasonably incurred. In addition, SCE faces inherent execution risks including such matters as the risks of human performance, workforce capabilities, public opposition, permitting delays, and governmental approvals. Decommissioning costs ultimately incurred could exceed the current estimates and cost increases resulting from contractual disputes, delays in performance by the contractor, elevated levels of inflation, or permitting delays, among other things, could cause SCE to materially overrun current decommissioning cost estimates and could materially impact the sufficiency of trust funds. See Liquidity and Capital Resources SCE Decommissioning of San Onofre in the MD A. 
 50 

Table of Contents 
 Even though San Onofre is being decommissioned, the presence of spent nuclear fuel still poses a potential risk of a nuclear incident. Federal law limits public liability claims from a nuclear incident to the amount of available financial protection, which is currently approximately 13.7 billion for Palo Verde and 560 million for San Onofre. SCE and other owners of San Onofre and Palo Verde have purchased the maximum private primary insurance available of 450 million per site. In the case of San Onofre, the balance is covered by a US Government indemnity. In the case of Palo Verde, the balance is covered by a loss sharing program among nuclear reactor licensees. There is no assurance that the CPUC would allow SCE to recover the required contribution made pursuant to this loss sharing program in the case of one or more nuclear incidents with claims that exceeded 450 million at a nuclear reactor which is participating in the program. If this public liability limit of 13.7 billion is insufficient, federal law contemplates that additional funds may be appropriated by Congress. There can be no assurance of SCE s ability to recover uninsured costs in the event the additional federal appropriations are insufficient. For more information on nuclear insurance risk, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies Contingencies Nuclear Insurance. SCE s distribution of water and propane gas on Catalina Island involves inherent risks of damage to private property and the environment and injury to employees and the general public. SCE owns and operates the water distribution system that serves Catalina Island, California and a propane gas distribution system that serves the City of Avalon on Catalina Island, California. Production, storage, treatment and distribution of water for human use and the transportation, storage, distribution and use of gas can be hazardous, and can cause damage to private property and the environment and injury to employees and the general public if equipment fails or does not perform as anticipated. For example, the risks of operating a water distribution system include the potential for burst pipes and water contamination and the risks of operating gas distribution system include the potential for gas leaks, fire or explosion. The risks related to SCE s operation of its water and gas distribution systems may be exacerbated due to aging infrastructure. SCE has requested that the CPUC allow SCE to include certain water system costs in electric rates and may make similar requests for the water and gas systems in the future. If such requests are denied, significant costs may not be recoverable from customers. In addition, SCE may have to pay fines, penalties and remediation costs if it does not comply with laws and regulations in the operation of the water and gas distribution systems. An inability to recover costs associated with any such damages or injuries or any fines, penalties or remediation costs, from insurance or through electric rates, could materially affect SCE s business, financial condition and results of operations. Financing Risks As a capital-intensive company, SCE relies on access to the capital markets. If SCE were unable to access the capital markets or the cost of financing were to substantially increase, its liquidity and operations could be materially affected. SCE regularly accesses the capital markets to finance its activities and is expected to do so by its regulators as part of its obligation to serve as a regulated utility. SCE s needs for capital for its ongoing infrastructure investment program are substantial. SCE s ability to obtain financing, as well as its ability to refinance debt and make scheduled payments of principal and interest, are dependent on numerous factors, including SCE s levels of indebtedness, maintenance of acceptable credit ratings, financial performance, liquidity and cash flow, and other market conditions. In addition, the actions of other California investor-owned utilities and legal, regulatory and legislative decisions impacting investor-owned utilities can affect market conditions and therefore, SCE s ability to obtain financing. SCE s inability to obtain additional capital from time to time could have a material effect on SCE s liquidity and operations. 
 51 

Table of Contents 
 Competitive and Market Risks SCE s inability to effectively and timely respond to the changes that the electricity industry is undergoing, as a result of increased competition, technological advances, and changes to the regulatory environment, could materially impact SCE s business model, financial condition and results of operations. Customers and third parties are increasingly deploying distributed energy resources DERs ), such as solar generation, energy storage, energy efficiency and demand response technologies. California s environmental policy objectives are accelerating the pace and scope of industry change. This change will require modernization of the electric distribution grid to, among other things, accommodate two-way flows of electricity and increase the grid s capacity to interconnect DERs. In addition, enabling California s clean energy economy goals will require sustained investments in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy efficiency programs, energy storage options and electric vehicle infrastructure. If SCE is unable to effectively adapt to these changes, its business model, its ability to execute on its strategy, and ultimately its financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted. Customer-owned generation and load departures to CCAs or Electric Service Providers each reduce the amount of electricity that customers purchase from utilities and have the effect of increasing utility rates unless customer rates are designed to allocate the costs of the distribution grid across all customers that benefit from its use. For example, some customers in California who generate their own power are not currently required to pay all transmission and distribution charges and non-bypassable charges, subject to limitations, which results in increased costs for those customers who do not own their generation. If regulations aren t changed such that customers pay their share of transmission and distribution costs and non-bypassable charges and the demand for electricity reduces so significantly that SCE is no longer effectively able to recover such costs from its customers, SCE s business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially impacted. In addition, the FERC has opened transmission development to competition from independent developers, allowing such developers to compete with incumbent utilities for the construction and operation of transmission facilities. For more information. See Business SCE Competition. Cybersecurity and Physical Security Risks SCE s systems and network infrastructure are targets for physical and cyber attacks, intrusions or other catastrophic events that could result in their failure or reduced functionality. Regulators such as NERC and U.S. Government agencies, including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Energy, have increasingly stressed that threat sources continue to seek to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the U.S. national electric grid and other energy infrastructures, and that such attacks and disruptions, both physical and cyber, are highly sophisticated and dynamic. Several U.S. Government agencies have highlighted the increasing risks related to physical attacks, ransomware attacks and cybersecurity risks related to the electric sector, including its supply chains, and that the risks may escalate during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions. SCE s operations require the continuous availability of critical information technology systems, sensitive customer and employee data and network infrastructure and information, all of which are targets for malicious actors. New cyber and physical threats arise as SCE moves from an analog to a digital electric grid. For example, SCE s grid modernization efforts and the move to a network-connected grid increases the number of threat surfaces and potential vulnerabilities that an adversary can target. SCE system data and architecture are also disclosed, either intentionally or unintentionally, to third parties and the public by regulators, employees, contractors and vendors. This system information may be used by malicious actors to understand SCE s systems to prepare for a cyber or physical attack. 
 52 

Table of Contents 
 SCE depends on a wide array of vendors to provide it with services and equipment. Malicious actors may attack vendors to disrupt the services they provide to SCE, or to use those vendors as a conduit to attack SCE. Additionally, the equipment and material provided by SCE s vendors may contain cyber vulnerabilities. A compromise of equipment and/or exfiltration of SCE data, whether by physical or by electronic means, could result in loss or changes to confidential or sensitive electronic data, loss of intellectual property and interruption of business processes. While some of SCE s vendors have experienced cybersecurity incidents, such incidents have not, to SCE s knowledge, resulted in a material impact to SCE to date. SCE s systems have experienced, and will continue to experience, cybersecurity incidents involving attacks of malicious code, unauthorized access attempts, and other illicit activities, but to SCE s knowledge it has not experienced a material cybersecurity or data breach to date. Though SCE actively monitors developments in this area, no security measures can completely shield its systems, infrastructure and data from cyber attacks, intrusions or other catastrophic events that could result in their failure or reduced functionality. If SCE s information technology and operational technology systems security measures were to be breached, or a critical system failure were to occur without timely recovery, SCE could be unable to fulfill critical business functions, such as delivery of electricity to customers, and/or sensitive confidential personal and other data could be compromised, which could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, material financial loss to SCE or to its customers, loss of confidence in SCE s security measures, customer dissatisfaction, and significant litigation and/or regulatory exposure, all of which could materially affect SCE s financial condition and results of operations and materially damage the business reputation of Edison International and SCE. RISKS RELATING TO EDISON INTERNATIONAL AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON COMPANY Edison International s and SCE s financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted by events, like the COVID-19 pandemic, that cause significant disruption to workforces, supply chains, economies, or societies on a regional, statewide, national or global basis. Edison International and SCE could be materially and adversely impacted by events, such as the widespread outbreak of a communicable disease, that result in, among other things, significant disruption to supply chains, economies, societies or workforces on a regional, statewide, national or global basis. For example, the global spread of COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, created significant uncertainty, volatility and disruption globally and has impacted the operations of Edison International and SCE. Many of the risks and uncertainties identified in this Form 10-K are, and will be, exacerbated by the impacts of an event like a pandemic and the actions being taken by governmental entities, businesses, individuals and others in response to such an event. For example, SCE may be unable to effectively execute its PSPS program due to, among other things, requests from local and State authorities not to shut off the power during a pandemic or other event, and thereby may increase the risk of SCE equipment being associated with the ignition of wildfires. In addition, impacts of a pandemic or similar event on SCE s customers and third parties could also result in SCE facing, among other things, significant reductions in demand for electricity and payment delays and/or defaults from customers which could result in significant under-collections. In addition, Edison International and SCE could also face payment delays and/or defaults from insurers and other counterparties. Furthermore, Edison International s and SCE s access to the bank and capital markets could also be constrained and/or the costs of accessing those markets could increase as a result of a pandemic or similar event, including if Edison International s and/or SCE s credit ratings are downgraded, or placed on negative watch due to concerns about Edison International and/or SCE s financial health as a result of the impacts of the pandemic. SCE may also incur significant incremental costs as a result of actions it is taking in response to a pandemic or a similar event, including costs being incurred to maintain its operations and assist its employees who are required to telework or are otherwise impacted by the event. SCE could also face delays in important legal and

 regulatory proceedings. These impacts, among others, could materially and adversely impact Edison International s and SCE s business, operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial results. Edison International s and SCE s business activities are concentrated in one industry and in one region. Edison International s and SCE s business activities are concentrated in the electric utility industry. Edison International s principal subsidiary, SCE, serves customers only in southern and central California. As a result, Edison International s and SCE s future performance may be affected by events and economic factors unique to California or by regional regulation, legislation or judicial decisions. For example, California courts have applied strict liability to investor-owned utilities in wildfire and other litigation matters. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 12.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Edison International Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Edison International and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes and schedule of condensed financial information of parent as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 appearing under Item 15 (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Contingent Liability 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events As described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Thomas Fire, the Koenigstein Fire, the Montecito Mudslides and the Woolsey Fire (collectively, the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events within the Company s service territory caused loss of life, substantial damage to both residential and business properties, and service outages for SCE customers in the Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Los Angeles Counties. Numerous claims related to wildfire events have been initiated against the Company. The Company has incurred material losses in connection with the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. As of December 31, 2022, SCE had paid 7.6 billion under executed settlements, had 185 million to be paid under executed settlements, including 120 million to be paid under the SED executed Agreement, and had 934 million of estimated losses for remaining alleged and potential claims reflected on their consolidated balance sheets related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. As of the same date, SCE had assets for expected recoveries through FERC electric rates of 142 million on their consolidated balance sheets and had exhausted expected insurance recoveries related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. Each reporting period, management reviews its loss estimates for remaining alleged and potential claims related to wildfire events. The process for estimating losses associated with alleged and potential wildfire related claims requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjective factors, including, but not limited to: estimates of known and expected claims by third parties based on currently available information, opinions of counsel regarding litigation risk, the status of and developments in the course of litigation, and prior experience litigating and settling wildfire litigation claims. As additional information becomes available, management s estimates and assumptions regarding the causes and financial impact of wildfire events may change. For instance, as a result of additional information, in 2022 management accrued additional estimated losses of 1.3 billion for claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, against which SCE has recorded expected recoveries through FERC electric rates of 76 million. The resulting net charge to earnings was 1.2 billion 879 million after-tax). The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events contingent liability is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when determining the probability of a loss being incurred and the best estimate of expected potential loss for these 
 56 

Table of Contents 
 contingencies related to assumptions and subjective factors based on currently available information and assessments, opinions regarding litigation risk, and prior experience with litigating and settling other wildfire cases. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s conclusion related to these loss contingencies. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s evaluation of loss contingencies associated with wildfires and mudslides. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsel, assessing the reasonableness of management s assessment regarding whether it is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable that a loss has been incurred, evaluating the assumptions and methods used by management in developing the best estimate of expected potential losses, including currently available information and assessments, opinions regarding litigation risk, and prior experience with litigating and settling other wildfire cases, and testing damage claim settlements. When assessing the assumptions related to the best estimate of expected potential losses, the assumptions used were evaluated for reasonableness considering (i) current damage claim settlements, (ii) past wildfire litigation history, and (iii) third-party source data. Recoverability of Regulatory Assets That Are Not Currently Reflected In Rates As described in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, including the accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises, which reflect the ratemaking policies of the CPUC and the FERC. Management applies authoritative guidance for rate-regulated enterprises to the portion of its operations in which regulators set rates at levels intended to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investments in assets, or rate base. Regulators may also impose certain penalties or grant certain incentives. Due to timing and other differences in the collection of electric utility revenue, these accounting principles require an incurred cost that would otherwise be charged to expense by a non-regulated entity to be capitalized as a regulatory asset if it is probable that the cost is recoverable through future rates. As disclosed by management, management assesses at the end of each reporting period whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as the current regulatory environment, the issuance of rate orders on recovery of the specific or a similar incurred cost of the Company or other rate-regulated entities, and other factors that would indicate that the regulator will treat an incurred cost as allowable for ratemaking purposes. As of December 31, 2022, 1.52 billion recorded in wildfire and drought restoration accounts and wildfire-related memorandum accounts represent wildfire and drought restoration costs that are probable of future recovery from customers. The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Company s recoverability of regulatory assets that are not currently reflected in rates is a critical audit matter is the significant judgment by management in determining the costs probable of recovery and reported as an asset on the balance sheet. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s assessment of the recoverability of regulatory assets not currently reflected in rates.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS square mile area of Southern California. Edison Energy Group is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Edison International and a holding company for Edison Energy, LLC Edison Energy which is engaged in the competitive business of providing decarbonization and energy solutions to commercial, institutional and industrial customers in North America and Europe. Edison Energy s business activities are currently not material to report as a separate business segment. These combined notes to the consolidated financial statements apply to both Edison International and SCE unless otherwise described. Edison International s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Edison International, SCE, and other wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries. References to Edison International refer to the consolidated group of Edison International and its subsidiaries. References to Edison International Parent and Other refer to Edison International Parent and its competitive subsidiaries and Edison International Parent refer to Edison International on a stand-alone basis, not consolidated with its subsidiaries. SCE s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SCE, its wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries and a variable interest entity of which SCE is the primary beneficiary, SCE Recovery Funding LLC. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated from the consolidated financial statements. Edison International s and SCE s accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ), including the accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises, which reflect the ratemaking policies of the California Public Utility Commission CPUC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC ). SCE applies authoritative guidance for rate-regulated enterprises to the portion of its operations in which regulators set rates at levels intended to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investments in assets, or rate base. Regulators may also impose certain penalties or grant certain incentives. Due to timing and other differences in the collection of electric utility revenue, these principles require an incurred cost that would otherwise be charged to expense by a non-regulated entity to be capitalized as a regulatory asset if it is probable that the cost is recoverable through future rates; and conversely the principles require recording of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and refundable to customers. In addition, SCE recognizes revenue and regulatory assets from alternative revenue programs, which enables the utility to adjust future rates in response to past activities or completed events, if certain criteria are met. SCE assesses, at the end of each reporting period, whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery. See Note 11 for composition of regulatory assets and liabilities. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been conformed to the current year s presentation, including separate presentation of common stock and preferred and preference stock dividends in SCE s consolidated statements of cash flows.

In August 2021, as a result of adoption of 2021 GRC, SCE recorded million million after-tax) in impairment charges related to disallowed historical capital expenditures of pole replacements the CPUC determined were performed prematurely in 2021. The impairment is included in Impairment, net of other (income) in the consolidated statements of income. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, SCE has million and million in assets recorded in property, plant and equipment in relation to restoration costs related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, respectively, which may not be recoverable. These assets would be impaired if the restoration costs are permanently disallowed by the CPUC in future cost recovery proceedings. For further details, see Note 12. billion and a billion long-term asset, respectively, as well as a million current asset for both years, reflected as Wildfire Insurance Fund contributions in their consolidated balance sheets for the initial billion contribution made during 2019 and the present value of annual contributions SCE committed to make to the Wildfire Insurance Fund, reduced by amortization. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, long-term liabilities of million and million, respectively, have been reflected in Other deferred credits and other long-term liabilities for the present value of unpaid contributions. Contributions were discounted to the present value using US treasury interest rates at the date SCE committed to participate in the Wildfire Insurance Fund. In 2022 and 2021, the asset was amortized based on an estimated period of coverage of . All expenses related to the contributions are being reflected in Wildfire Insurance Fund Expense in the consolidated statements of income. Changes in the estimated period of coverage provided by the Wildfire Insurance Fund could lead to material changes in future expense recognition. In estimating the period of coverage, Edison International and SCE used Monte Carlo simulations based on historical data from wildfires caused by electrical utility equipment to estimate expected losses, using (2014 2021) of available historical data in 2022 and (2014 2020) of available historical data in 2021. The details of the operation of the Wildfire Insurance Fund and estimates related to claims by SCE, Pacific Gas Electric Company PG E ), and San Diego Gas Electric SDG E against the fund have been applied to the expected loss simulations to estimate the period of coverage of the fund. The most sensitive inputs to the estimated period of coverage are the expected frequency of wildfire events caused by investor-owned utility electrical equipment and the estimated costs associated with those forecasted events. Edison International and SCE evaluate all inputs annually, or upon claims being made from the fund for catastrophic wildfires, and the expected life of the insurance fund will be adjusted as required. Based on information available in the first quarter of 2023 regarding catastrophic wildfires during 2022, SCE reassessed its estimate of the life of the Wildfire Insurance Fund. Using of historical data (2014 2022) of wildfires caused by electrical utility equipment to create Monte Carlo simulations of expected losses,

 from the date SCE committed to participate in the Wildfire Insurance Fund. Edison International and SCE will assess the Wildfire Insurance Fund contribution assets for impairment in the event that a participating utility s electrical equipment is found to be the substantial cause of a catastrophic wildfire, based on the ability of SCE to benefit from the coverage provided by the Wildfire Insurance Fund in an amount equal to the recorded assets. Accretion 1 Revisions ) Liabilities settled ) ) Ending balance 
 1 An ARO represents the present value of a future obligation. Accretion is an increase in the liability to account for the time value of money resulting from discounting. 
 AROs related to decommissioning of SCE s nuclear power facilities are based on site-specific studies conducted as part of each Nuclear Decommissioning Cost Triennial Proceeding NDCTP conducted before the CPUC. Revisions of an ARO are established for updated site-specific decommissioning cost estimates. The ARO for decommissioning SCE s San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station San Onofre and Palo Verde nuclear power facilities is billion as of December 31, 2022. The liability to decommission SCE s nuclear power facilities is based on a 2020 decommissioning study, filed as part of the 2021 NDCTP, for San Onofre Unit 1, 2 and 3 and a 2019 decommissioning study for Palo Verde, with revisions to the cost estimate in 2020. SCE records an ARO regulatory liability as a result of timing differences between the recognition of costs and the recovery of costs through the ratemaking process. For further information, see Note 11. Decommissioning of San Onofre Unit 1 began in 1999 and the transfer of spent nuclear fuel from Unit 1 to dry cask storage in the Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation ISFSI 1 was completed in 2005. Major decommissioning work for Unit 1 has been completed except for certain underground work. Decommissioning of San Onofre Units 2 and 3 began in June 2013 and the transfer of spent nuclear fuel from San Onofre Units 2 and 3 to dry cask storage in the two ISFSIs was completed in August 2020. In October 2019, the California Coastal Commission approved SCE s application for a Coastal Development Permit, the principal discretionary permit required to start major decommissioning activities at San Onofre Units 2 and 3. In August 2020,

 billion through 2080 to decommission its nuclear facilities. This estimate is based on SCE s decommissioning cost methodology used for ratemaking purposes, escalated at rates ranging from to (depending on the cost element) annually. These costs are expected to be funded from independent decommissioning trusts. SCE estimates annual after-tax earnings on the decommissioning funds of to dependent on asset class. If the assumed return on trust assets is not earned or costs escalate at higher rates, SCE expects that additional funds needed for decommissioning will be recoverable through future rates, subject to a reasonableness review. See Note 10 for further information. Due to regulatory recovery of SCE s nuclear decommissioning expense, prudently incurred costs for nuclear decommissioning activities do not affect SCE s earnings. SCE s nuclear decommissioning costs are subject to CPUC review through the triennial regulatory proceedings. SCE s nuclear decommissioning trust investments primarily consist of fixed income investments that are classified as available-for-sale and equity investments. Due to regulatory mechanisms, investment earnings and realized gains and losses have no impact on earnings. Unrealized gains and losses on decommissioning trust funds, including impairment, increase or decrease the trust assets and the related regulatory asset or liability and have no impact on electric utility revenue or decommissioning expense. SCE reviews each fixed income security for impairment on the last day of each month. If the fair value on the last day of the month is less than the amortized cost for that security, SCE impairs the disclosed amortized cost. If the fair value is greater or less than the carrying value for that security at the time of sale, SCE recognizes a related realized gain or loss, respectively. million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, reflected as long-term Regulatory assets in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, Edison International and SCE had debt issuance costs related to issuances of long-term debt of million and million at December 31, 2022 and million and million at December 31, 2021, respectively. These costs are recorded as an offset to long-term debt.

 on a weighted average basis over the January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2025 compliance period Capital Structure Compliance Period ). This is unchanged from the January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022 compliance period. The CPUC authorized capital structure differs from the capital structure calculated based on GAAP due to certain exclusions allowed by CPUC, including the impact of SCE s contributions to the Wildfire Insurance Fund under AB 1054. For further information, see Business SCE Overview of Ratemaking Process and Business Southern California Wildfires. In May 2020, the CPUC issued a decision on SCE s application to the CPUC for waiver of compliance with its equity ratio requirement, that allows SCE to exclude from its equity ratio calculations (i) net charges accrued in connection with the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events and (ii) debt issued for the purpose of paying claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events up to an amount equal to the net charges accrued in connection with the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. With these exclusions, SCE was in compliance with its authorized capital structure for the compliance period from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022. The temporary exclusion lapsed on May 7, 2022. In April 2022, SCE filed another application requesting continued waiver of compliance with its equity ratio requirement. Under the CPUC s rules, SCE will not be deemed to be in violation of the equity ratio requirement while the waiver application is pending resolution. While the exclusion is in place, SCE is required to notify the CPUC if an adverse financial event reduces SCE s spot equity ratio by more than one percent from the level most recently filed with the CPUC in the proceeding. The last spot equity ratio SCE filed with the CPUC in the proceeding did not exclude the then billion net charge and was as of December 31, 2018 (at the time the common equity component of SCE s CPUC authorized capital structure was required to remain at or above on a weighted average basis over the applicable 37-month period). SCE s spot equity ratio on December 31, 2018 would have been had the billion net charge at December 31, 2018 been excluded, therefore SCE will notify the CPUC if its spot ratio drops below in any quarter. For further information, see Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies Contingencies Southern California Wildfires and Mudslides. SCE monitors its compliance with the CPUC s equity ratio requirement based on the weighted average of the common equity component of SCE s CPUC authorized capital structure over the Capital Structure Compliance Period using its actual capital structure from the beginning of the Capital Structure Compliance Period through the reporting date together with forecasted performance and expected financing activities for the remainder of the Capital Structure Compliance Period. SCE expects to be compliant with its CPUC authorized capital structure at the end of its current compliance period, December 31, 2025. SCE s ability to declare and pay common dividends may be restricted under the terms of its outstanding series of preference stock. For further information see Note 14. As a California corporation, SCE s ability to pay dividends is also governed by the California General Corporation Law. California law requires that for a dividend to be declared: (a) retained earnings must equal or exceed the proposed dividend, or (b) immediately after the dividend is made, the value of the corporation s assets must exceed the value of its liabilities plus amounts required to be paid, if any, in order to liquidate stock senior to the shares receiving the dividend. Additionally, a California corporation may not declare a dividend if it is, or as a result of the dividend would be, likely to be unable to meet its liabilities as they mature. Prior to declaring dividends, SCE s Board of Directors evaluates available information, including when applicable, information pertaining to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, to ensure

 million. The timing and amount of future dividends are also dependent on a number of other factors including SCE s requirements to fund other obligations and capital expenditures, and its ability to access the capital markets and generate operating cash flows and earnings. If SCE incurs significant costs related to catastrophic wildfires and is unable to recover such costs through insurance, the Wildfire Insurance Fund (for fires after July 12, 2019), or from customers or is unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms, SCE may be limited in its ability to pay future dividends to Edison International and its preference shareholders. Edison International Dividend In December 2022, Edison International declared a increase to the annual dividend rate from per share to per share.

 Variable Interest in VIEs that are not Consolidated Power Purchase Agreements SCE has PPAs that are classified as variable interests in VIEs, including agreements through which SCE provides the natural gas to fuel the plants, fixed price contracts for renewable energy, and resource adequacy agreements that, upon the seller s election, include the purchase of energy at fixed prices. SCE has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs since it does not control the commercial and operating activities of these entities. Since payments for capacity are the primary source of income, the most significant economic activity for these VIEs is the operation and maintenance of the power plants. As of the balance sheet date, the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in SCE s consolidated balance sheet that relate to involvement with VIEs that are not consolidated result from amounts due under the PPAs. Under these contracts, SCE recovers the costs incurred through demonstration of compliance with its CPUC-approved long-term power procurement plans. SCE has no residual interest in the entities and has not provided or guaranteed any debt or equity support, liquidity arrangements, performance guarantees or other commitments associated with these contracts other than the purchase commitments described in Note 12. As a result, there is no significant potential exposure to loss to SCE from its variable

The trusts are VIEs. SCE has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs as it does not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the trusts. SCE Trust II, Trust III, Trust IV, Trust V and Trust VI issued to the public trust securities in the face amounts of million, million, million, million and million (cumulative, liquidation amounts of per share), respectively, and of common stock each to SCE. The trusts invested the proceeds of these trust securities in Series G, Series H, Series J, Series K and Series L Preference Stock issued by SCE in the principal amounts of million, million, million, million and million (cumulative, per share liquidation values), respectively, which have substantially the same payment terms as the respective trust securities. The Series G, Series H, Series J, Series K and Series L Preference Stock and the corresponding trust securities do not have a maturity date. Upon any redemption of any shares of the Series G, Series H, Series J, Series K or Series L Preference Stock, a corresponding dollar amount of trust securities will be redeemed by the applicable trust (see Note 14 for further information). The applicable trust will make distributions at the same rate and on the same dates on the applicable series of trust securities if and when the SCE board of directors declares and makes dividend payments on the related Preference Stock. The applicable trust will use any dividends it receives on the related Preference Stock to make its corresponding distributions on the applicable series of trust securities. If SCE does not make a dividend payment to any of these trusts, SCE would be prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock. SCE has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment of the trust securities and trust distributions, if and when SCE pays dividends on the related Preference Stock.

Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts SCE s nuclear decommissioning trust investments include equity securities, U.S. treasury securities and other fixed income securities. Equity and treasury securities are classified as Level 1 as fair value is determined by observable market prices in active or highly liquid and transparent markets. The remaining fixed income securities are classified as Level 2. The fair value of these financial instruments is based on evaluated prices that reflect significant observable market information such as reported trades, actual trade information of similar securities, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, bids, offers and relevant credit information. There are no securities classified as Level 3 in the nuclear decommissioning trusts. SCE s investment policies and CPUC requirements place limitations on the types and investment grade ratings of the securities that may be held by the nuclear decommissioning trust funds. These policies restrict the trust from holding alternative investments and limit the trust funds exposures to investments in highly illiquid markets. With respect to equity and fixed income securities, the trustee obtains prices from third-party pricing services which SCE is able to independently corroborate as described below. The trustee monitors prices supplied by pricing services, including reviewing prices against defined parameters tolerances and performs research and resolves variances beyond the set parameters. SCE corroborates the fair values of securities by comparison to other market-based price sources obtained by SCE s investment managers. Differences outside established thresholds are followed-up with the trustee and resolved. For each reporting period, SCE reviews the trustee determined fair value hierarchy and overrides the trustee level classification when appropriate.

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments SCE presents its derivative assets and liabilities on a net basis on its consolidated balance sheets when subject to master netting agreements or similar agreements. Derivative positions are also offset against margin and cash collateral deposits. In addition, SCE has provided collateral in the form of letters of credit. Collateral requirements can vary depending upon the level of unsecured credit extended by counterparties, changes in market prices relative to contractual commitments and other factors.

 Financial Statement Impact of Derivative Instruments SCE recognizes realized gains and losses on derivative instruments as purchased power expense and expects that such gains or losses will be part of the purchased power costs recovered from customers. As a result, realized gains and losses do not affect earnings, but may temporarily affect cash flows. Due to expected future recovery from customers, unrealized gains and losses are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities and therefore also do not affect earnings.

The amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards recognized as part of deferred income taxes includes million and million related to Capistrano Wind for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The change in Capistrano s carryforwards is primarily due to a sale of the Capistrano Wind projects consummated in the third quarter of 2022.

 1 In 2021, Edison International and SCE recognized tax benefits related to a settlement with the California Franchise Tax Board FTB for tax years 2007 2012. See further discussion in Tax Disputes below. In 2020, Edison International and SCE recognized tax expense and benefit, respectively, primarily due to the re-measurement of uncertain tax positions related to the 2010 2012 California state tax filings currently under audit. 2 Relates to the non-tax deductible portions of the SED Agreement (as defined in Note 12). See Note 12 for further discussion under 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. 3 In July 2021, SCE received the IRS response to its private letter ruling request, regarding the scope of the deferred tax normalization requirements and the computations required to comply with the average rate assumption method. As a result, SCE s estimate changed and a cumulative true-up of million reduction in tax benefits was recorded in the third quarter of 2021, for the period of January 1, 2018 to June 30, 2021. 
 The CPUC requires flow-through ratemaking treatment for the current tax benefit arising from certain property-related and other temporary differences which reverse over time. Flow-through items reduce current authorized revenue requirements in SCE s rate cases and result in a regulatory asset for recovery of deferred income taxes in future periods. The difference between the authorized amounts as determined in SCE s rate cases, adjusted for balancing and memorandum account activities, and the recorded flow-through items also result in increases or decreases in regulatory assets with a corresponding impact on the effective tax rate to the extent that recorded deferred amounts are expected to be recovered in future rates. For further information, see Note 11. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes Authoritative guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires an enterprise to recognize, in its financial statements, the best estimate of the impact of a tax position by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not, based solely on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. The guidance requires the disclosure of all unrecognized tax benefits, which includes both the reserves recorded for tax positions on filed tax returns and the unrecognized portion of affirmative claims.

 2021 2020 Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions Pension Plans Noncontributory defined benefit pension plans (some with cash balance features) cover most employees meeting minimum service requirements. Employees hired by the participating companies on or after December 31, 2017 are no longer eligible to participate in the pension plan. In lieu of that, an additional non-contributory employer contribution is deposited into the Edison 401(k) Savings Plan. SCE recognizes pension expense for its nonexecutive plan as calculated by the actuarial method used for ratemaking. The expected contributions (all by the employer) for Edison International and SCE are approximately million and million, respectively, for the year ending December 31, 2023. Annual contributions made by SCE to most of SCE s pension plans are anticipated to be recovered through CPUC-approved regulatory mechanisms. The funded position of Edison International s pension is sensitive to changes in market conditions. Changes in overall interest rate levels significantly affect the company s liabilities, while assets held in the various trusts established to fund Edison International s pension are affected by movements in the equity and bond markets. Due to SCE s regulatory recovery treatment, a regulatory asset is recorded equal to the unfunded status and a regulatory liability is recorded equal to the funded status.

Eligibility for a company contribution toward the cost of these benefits in retirement depends on a number of factors, including the employee s years of service, age, hire date, and retirement date. Employees hired on or after December 31, 2017 are no longer eligible for retiree healthcare benefits. In lieu of those benefits, Edison International will provide a health reimbursement account of per month available only after meeting certain age and service year requirements. Under the terms of the Edison International Welfare Benefit Plan PBOP Plan ), each participating employer (Edison International or its participating subsidiaries) is responsible for the costs and expenses of PBOP Plan benefits with respect to its employees and former employees that exceed the participants share of contributions. A participating employer may terminate the PBOP Plan benefits with respect to its employees and former employees, as may SCE (as PBOP Plan sponsor), and, accordingly, the participants PBOP Plan benefits are not vested benefits. The expected contributions (substantially all of which are expected to be made by SCE) for PBOP benefits are million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Annual contributions related to SCE employees made to SCE plans are anticipated to be recovered through CPUC-approved regulatory mechanisms and are expected to be, at a minimum, equal to the total annual expense for these plans. SCE has voluntary employees beneficiary association trusts VEBA Trusts that can only be used to pay for retiree health care benefits of SCE and its subsidiaries. Once funded into the VEBA Trusts, neither SCE nor Edison International can subsequently recover remaining amounts in the VEBA Trusts. Participants of the PBOP Plan do not have a beneficial interest in the VEBA Trusts. The VEBA Trust assets are sensitive to changes in market conditions. Changes in overall interest rate levels significantly affect the company s liabilities, while assets held in the various trusts established to fund Edison International s other postretirement benefits are affected by movements in the equity and bond markets. Due to SCE s regulatory recovery treatment, the funded status is offset by a regulatory liability.

Plan assets are invested using a combination of asset classes and may have active and passive investment strategies within asset classes. Target allocations for 2022 pension plan assets were for U.S. equities, for non-U.S. equities, for fixed income and for opportunistic and/or alternative investments. Target allocations for 2022 PBOP plan assets (except for Represented VEBA which is for fixed income and for U.S. and non-U.S. equities) are for U.S. and non-U.S. equities, for fixed income and for opportunistic and/or alternative investments. Edison International employs multiple investment management firms. Investment managers within each asset class cover a range of

Table of Contents 
 . Where approved by the fiduciary investment committee, futures contracts are used for portfolio rebalancing and to reallocate portfolio cash positions. Where authorized, a few of the plans investment managers employ limited use of derivatives, including futures contracts, options, options on futures and interest rate swaps in place of direct investment in securities to gain efficient exposure to markets. Derivatives are not used to leverage the plans or any portfolios. Determination of the Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Assets The overall expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption is based on the long-term target asset allocation for plan assets and capital markets return forecasts for asset classes employed. A portion of the PBOP trust asset returns is subject to taxation, so the expected long-term rate of return for these assets is determined on an after-tax basis. Capital Markets Return Forecasts SCE s capital markets return forecast methodologies primarily use a combination of historical market data, current market conditions, proprietary forecasting expertise, complex models to develop asset class return forecasts and a building block approach. The forecasts are developed using variables such as real risk-free interest, inflation and asset class specific risk premiums. For equities, the risk premium is based on an assumed average equity risk premium of over cash. The forecasted return on private equity and opportunistic investments are estimated at a premium above public equity, reflecting a premium for higher volatility and lower liquidity. For fixed income, the risk premium is based on a comprehensive modeling of credit spreads. Fair Value of Plan Assets The PBOP Plan and the Southern California Edison Company Retirement Plan Trust assets include investments in equity securities, U.S. treasury securities, other fixed-income securities, common/collective funds, mutual funds, other investment entities, foreign exchange and interest rate contracts, and partnership/joint ventures.

 Stock Options Under the 2007 Performance Incentive Plan, Edison International has granted stock options at exercise prices equal to the closing price at the grant date. Edison International may grant stock options and other awards related to, or with a value derived from, its common stock to directors and certain employees. Options generally expire after the grant date and vest over a period of three or of continuous service in equal annual increments, except for awards granted to retirement-eligible participants, which vest on an accelerated basis. The fair value for each option granted was determined as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires various assumptions noted in the following table: Risk-free interest rate - - - Expected dividend yield - - - Weighted average expected dividend yield Expected volatility - - - Weighted average volatility The expected term represents the period of time for which the options are expected to be outstanding and is primarily based on historical exercise and post-vesting cancellation experience and stock price history. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury STRIPS (separate trading of registered interest and principal of securities) whose maturity corresponds to the option s expected term on the measurement date. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of Edison International s common stock for the length of the option s expected term for 2022. The volatility period used was , and at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

 acres, destroyed or damaged an estimated structures and resulted in confirmed fatalities. The largest of the November 2018 fires in SCE s territory, known as the Woolsey Fire, originated in Ventura County and burned acreage in both Ventura and Los Angeles Counties. According to CAL FIRE, the Woolsey Fire burned almost acres, destroyed an estimated structures, damaged an estimated structures and resulted in confirmed fatalities. additional fatalities are alleged to have been associated with the Woolsey Fire. As described below, multiple lawsuits related to the Thomas and Koenigstein Fires and the Woolsey Fire have been initiated against SCE and Edison International. Some of the Thomas and Koenigstein Fires lawsuits claim that SCE and Edison International have responsibility for the damages caused by debris flows and flooding in Montecito and surrounding areas in January 2018 (the Montecito Mudslides based on a theory alleging that SCE has responsibility for the Thomas and/or Koenigstein Fires and further alleging that the Thomas and/or Koenigstein Fires proximately caused the Montecito Mudslides. According to Santa Barbara County initial reports, the Montecito Mudslides destroyed an estimated structures, damaged an estimated structures, and resulted in confirmed fatalities, with additional fatalities presumed. One of the presumed fatalities has been confirmed. The Thomas Fire, the Koenigstein Fire, the Montecito Mudslides (defined below) and the Woolsey Fire are each referred to as a 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Event, and, collectively, referred to as the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. In 2022, SCE accrued estimated losses of billion for claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, against which SCE has recorded expected recoveries through FERC electric rates of million. The resulting net charge to earnings was billion million after-tax). As of December 31, 2022, SCE had paid billion under executed settlements, had million to be paid under executed settlements, including million to be paid under the SED Agreement (as defined below), and had million of estimated losses for remaining alleged and potential claims reflected on their consolidated balance sheets related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. As of the same date, SCE had assets for expected recoveries through FERC electric rates of million on their consolidated balance sheets and had exhausted expected insurance recoveries related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. The estimated losses for the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events do not include an estimate of potential losses related to certain alleged and potential claims made by the California Governor s Office of Emergency Service Cal OES seeking recovery on behalf of itself and 30 state and local government entities that did not pursue their own suits against SCE, but sustained damage in the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events and received funding through the Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA that was dispersed by the Cal OES. As of the filing of this report SCE has not concluded that losses related to FEMA funds disbursed by Cal OES are probable. Edison International and SCE may incur a material loss in excess of amounts accrued in connection with the remaining alleged and potential claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events.

SCE has also agreed to pay for each dollar in claims to be paid by the Woolsey Subrogation Plaintiffs to their policy holders on or before July 15, 2023, up to an agreed upon cap. As of December 31, 2022, SCE has also entered into settlements with approximately individual plaintiffs in the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events litigation. In 2020, 2021 and 2022, SCE entered into settlements with individual plaintiffs in the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events litigation under which it agreed to pay an aggregate of approximately million, billion and billion, respectively, to those individual plaintiffs. In the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2022 SCE entered into settlements with individual plaintiffs in the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events litigation under which it agreed to pay an aggregate of approximately million, million, million and million, respectively, to those individual plaintiffs. The statutes of limitations for individual plaintiffs in the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events have expired. Edison International and SCE did not admit wrongdoing or liability as part of any of the settlements described above. Other claims and potential claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events remain. SCE continues to explore reasonable settlement opportunities with other plaintiffs in the outstanding 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events litigation. SED Agreement In October 2021, SCE and the SED executed an agreement (the SED Agreement to resolve the SED s investigations into the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events and three other 2017 wildfires for, among other things, aggregate costs of million. The million in costs comprised of a million fine to be paid to the State of California General Fund, million of shareholder-funded safety measures, and an agreement by SCE to waive its right to seek cost recovery in CPUC-jurisdictional rates for million of third-party uninsured claims payments. The SED Agreement provides that SCE may, on a permanent basis, exclude from its ratemaking capital structure any after-tax charges to equity or debt borrowed to finance costs incurred under the SED Agreement. The SED Agreement also imposes other obligations on SCE, including reporting requirements and safety-focused studies. SCE s obligations under the SED

 million within the FERC balancing account. This was the FERC portion of the total estimated losses accrued. As of December 31, 2022, collections have reduced the regulatory assets remaining in the FERC balancing account to million. In July 2019, SCE filed a CEMA application with the CPUC to seek recovery of, among other things, approximately million of capital expenditures and capital related expenses incurred to restore service to customers and to repair, replace and restore buildings and SCE s facilities damaged or destroyed as a result of six 2017 fires, primarily the Thomas and Koenigstein Fires. In August 2021, the CPUC issued a final decision which denied without prejudice SCE s application to recover a revenue requirement of million for all six 2017 wildfires on the basis that SCE did not demonstrate that it was prudent in relation to the Thomas and Rye fires and had failed to segregate the costs attributable to the other four fires. Of the million revenue requirement that was denied, million was for the Thomas and Rye fires. CAL FIRE has determined that the Thomas and Rye fires were caused by SCE equipment. The decision allows SCE to submit additional applications with the CPUC to recover the costs associated with the Thomas and Rye fires, does not specify a deadline for any such applications, and directs that SCE must prove it was prudent in relation to the Thomas and/or Rye fires, as applicable, in any such future applications. As required by the final decision with respect to the other four fires, SCE filed supplemental testimony in November 2021 segregating the restoration costs attributable to each such fire. In June 2022, the CPUC approved SCE s entire request with respect to the other four fires. As of December 31, 2022, SCE has million in assets recorded in property, plant and equipment in relation to restoration costs related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events which may not be recoverable. These assets would be impaired if the restoration costs are permanently disallowed by the CPUC in future cost recovery proceedings. SCE expects to seek to recover costs incurred for reconstructing its system and restoring service to structures that were damaged or destroyed by the Thomas, Koenigstein and Woolsey Fires in future applications with the CPUC. Post-2018 Wildfires Several wildfires have significantly impacted portions of SCE s service territory after 2018 (the wildfires that originated in Southern California after 2018 where SCE s equipment may be alleged to be associated with the fire s ignition are referred to collectively as the Post-2018 Wildfires ).

 million for claims related to the Post-2018 Wildfires, against which SCE has recorded expected recoveries from insurance of million and expected recoveries through electric rates of million. The resulting net charge to earnings was million million after-tax). Through December 31, 2022, SCE has recorded total estimated losses (established at the lower end of the estimated range of reasonably possible losses) of million, and expected recoveries from insurance of million and expected recoveries through electric rates of million related to the Post-2018 Wildfires. The after-tax net charges to earnings recorded through December 31, 2022 have been million . Expected recoveries from insurance recorded for the Post-2018 Wildfires are supported by SCE s insurance coverage for multiple policy years. As of December 31, 2022, SCE had paid million under executed settlements related to the Post-2018 Wildfires. After giving effect to all payment obligations under settlements entered into through December 31, 2022, Edison International s and SCE s estimated losses (established at the lower end of the estimated range of reasonably possible losses) for remaining alleged and potential claims related to the Post-2018 Wildfires was million. As of the same date, SCE had assets for expected recoveries through insurance of million and through electric rates of million on their consolidated balance sheets related to the Post-2018 Wildfires. Expected recoveries from insurance recorded for the Post-2018 Wildfires are supported by SCE s insurance coverage for multiple policy years. While Edison International and SCE may incur material losses in excess of the amounts accrued for certain of the Post-2018 Wildfires, Edison International and SCE expect that any losses incurred in connection with any such fire will be covered by insurance, subject to self-insured retentions and co-insurance, and expect that any such losses after expected recoveries from insurance and through electric rates will not be material. 2019 Saddle Ridge Fire The Saddle Ridge Fire, originated in Los Angeles County in October 2019 and burned approximately acres, destroyed an estimated structures, damaged an estimated structures, and resulted in one fatality and injuries to fire fighters. In an unsigned and undated report that SCE received in December 2022, the Los Angeles Fire Department stated with respect to the Saddle Ridge Fire that the cause of ignition was unintentional, the form of heat was undetermined, the item first ignited was undetermined and the material type first ignited was undetermined. The Los Angeles Fire Department report noted that no other competent ignition sources other than SCE s transmission lines were found in the specific origin area of the Saddle Ridge Fire. SCE has been advised that the Los Angeles Fire Department investigation of the Saddle Ridge Fire remains open. Based on pending litigation and without considering insurance recoveries, it is reasonably possible that SCE will incur a material loss in connection with the Saddle Ridge Fire, but the range of reasonably possible losses that could be incurred cannot be estimated at this time. SCE has not accrued a charge for potential losses relating to the Saddle Ridge Fire. 2020 Bobcat Fire The Bobcat Fire was reported in the vicinity of Cogswell Dam in Los Angeles County in September 2020. The United States Forest Service USFS has reported that the Bobcat Fire burned approximately acres in Los Angeles County, destroyed an estimated homes, commercial property and minor structures, damaged an estimated homes and minor structures, and resulted in injuries to firefighters. In addition, fire authorities have estimated suppression costs at million. While SCE s investigation remains ongoing, SCE s information reflects that a camera in the vicinity of Cogswell Dam captured the initial stages of a fire with the first observed smoke approximately six minutes before a SCE circuit in the area experienced an anomaly (a relay). An investigation into the cause of the Bobcat Fire is being led by the USFS, and the USFS has taken a specific section of an SCE overhead conductor in the vicinity of Cogswell Dam into possession as part of its investigation. SCE understands that the USFS has also taken three tree branches in the area into possession. The SED is also conducting an investigation of the Bobcat Fire.

SCE expects to obtain and review additional information and materials in the possession of third parties during the course of its internal reviews and the litigation process. SCE has accrued material charges for potential losses relating to the Coastal Fire. The accrued charges correspond to the lower end of the estimated range of reasonably possible losses that may be incurred in connection with the Coastal Fire and is subject to change as additional information becomes available. While Edison International and SCE may incur a material loss in excess of the amount accrued, they cannot estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible losses that may be incurred. 2022 Fairview Fire The Fairview Fire originated in Riverside County in September 2022 and burned approximately acres. CAL FIRE has reported that the Fairview Fire destroyed residential structures, damaged residential structures, and destroyed or damaged minor structures. CAL FIRE also reported civilian fatalities, civilian injury and injuries to responding fire personnel. In addition, fire authorities have estimated suppression costs at million.

EIS ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Edison International, paid million insurance, which was included in the insurance recovery of SCE but was excluded in Edison International. 
 Recovery of SCE s losses realized in connection with the Post-2018 Wildfires in excess of available insurance is subject to approval by regulators. The CPUC and FERC may not allow SCE to recover uninsured losses through electric rates if it is determined that such losses were not reasonably or prudently incurred. Under accounting standards for rate-regulated enterprises, SCE defers costs as regulatory assets when it concludes that such costs are probable of future recovery in electric rates. SCE utilizes objectively determinable evidence to form its view on probability of future recovery. As discussed above, there is evidence of a California investor-owned utility seeking recovery for uninsured wildfire-related costs and FERC allowing recovery of all FERC-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs while the CPUC rejected recovery of all CPUC-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs based on a determination that the utility did not meet the CPUC s prudency standard. This evidence was prior to the adoption of AB 1054 on July 12, 2019, after which date AB 1054 clarified that the CPUC must find a utility to be prudent if the utility s conduct related to the ignition was consistent with actions that a reasonable utility would have undertaken in good faith under similar circumstances, at the relevant point in time, and based on the information available at that time. Further, utilities with a valid safety certification at the time of the relevant wildfire will be presumed to have acted prudently related to a wildfire ignition unless a party in the cost recovery proceeding creates serious doubt as to the reasonableness of the utility s conduct, at which time, the burden shifts back to the utility to prove its conduct was prudent. Each of the Post-2018 Wildfires was ignited after July 12, 2019, and SCE has held a valid safety certificate since July 15, 2019. While a California investor-owned utility has not yet sought recovery for uninsured claims and other costs related to wildfires ignited after the adoption of AB 1054 , SCE believes that for fires ignited after July 12, 2019, and investor-owned utilities holding a safety certificate at the time of the fire, the CPUC will apply a standard of review similar to that applied by the FERC which presumes all costs requested by an investor-owned utility are reasonable and prudent unless serious doubt as to

 million within the WEMA and risk management balancing account and million within the FERC balancing account. SCE will continue to evaluate the probability of recovery based on available evidence, including regulatory decisions, including any CPUC decisions illustrating the interpretation and/or application of the prudency standard under AB 1054, and, for each applicable fire, evidence that could cast serious doubt as to the reasonableness of SCE s conduct relative to that fire. Wildfire Insurance Coverage SCE has approximately billion of wildfire-specific insurance coverage for events that may occur during the period July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2023, subject to up to million of self-insured retention and co-insurance per fire, which results in aggregate net coverage of approximately million. Of this coverage, approximately million is provided by EIS and approximately million is provided by other commercial insurance carriers (commercial insurance carriers other than EIS are referred to herein as Third-Party Commercial Insurers ). SCE has approximately billion of wildfire-specific insurance coverage for events that occurred during the period July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022, subject to up to million of self-insured retention and co-insurance per fire, as well as additional co-insurance of up to million for the policy year, which resulted in net coverage of approximately million provided by Third-Party Commercial Insurers and million provided by EIS for part of the policy year. SCE believes that its insurance coverage for the July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2023 period meets its obligation to maintain reasonable insurance coverage under AB 1054. Edison International and SCE record a receivable for insurance recoveries when recovery of a recorded loss is determined to be probable. SCE s wildfire insurance expense for the July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2023 policy period will be approximately million, of which million is paid to Third-Party Commercial Insurers. SCE s wildfire insurance expense for the July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022 policy period was approximately million, of which million was paid to Third-Party Commercial Insurers. The difference between the Third-Party Commercial Insurer cost and total cost in both policy years was paid in premiums to EIS. Wildfire insurance premiums paid for the July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022 and July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2023 policy periods are being recovered through customer rates. See Note 18 for further information. While SCE s cost of obtaining wildfire insurance coverage from Third-Party Commercial Insurers was lower in 2022 compared to 2021, SCE s cost of obtaining wildfire insurance coverage in recent years is significantly higher than costs incurred prior to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events due to, among other things, the number of significant wildfire events throughout California and the application of inverse condemnation to investor-owned utilities. While SCE is required to maintain reasonable insurance coverage under AB 1054, SCE may not be able to obtain a reasonable amount of wildfire insurance, at a reasonable cost, from Third-Party Commercial Insurers for future policy periods. Environmental Remediation SCE records its environmental remediation liabilities when site assessments and/or remedial actions are probable and a range of reasonably likely cleanup costs can be estimated. SCE reviews its sites and measures the liability quarterly, by assessing a range of reasonably likely costs for each identified site using currently available information, including existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, experience gained at similar sites, and the probable level of involvement and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties. These estimates include costs for site investigations, remediation, operation and maintenance, monitoring and site closure. Unless there is a single probable 
 133 

Table of Contents 
 identified material sites (sites with a liability balance as of December 31, 2022, in which the upper end of the range of the costs is at least million) was million, including million related to San Onofre. In addition to these sites, SCE also has immaterial sites with a liability balance on December 31, 2022 for which the total minimum recorded liability was million. Of the million total environmental remediation liability for SCE, million has been recorded as a regulatory asset. SCE expects to recover million through an incentive mechanism that allows SCE to recover of its environmental remediation costs at certain sites (SCE may request to include additional sites in this mechanism), and million through proceedings that allow SCE to recover up to of the costs incurred at certain sites through customer rates. SCE s identified sites include several sites for which there is a lack of currently available information, including the nature and magnitude of contamination, and the extent, if any, that SCE may be held responsible for contributing to any costs incurred for remediating these sites. Thus, no reasonable estimate of cleanup costs can be made for these sites. The ultimate costs to clean up SCE s identified sites may vary from its recorded liability due to numerous uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, such as: the extent and nature of contamination; the scarcity of reliable data for identified sites; the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods; developments resulting from investigatory studies; the possibility of identifying additional sites; and the time periods over which site remediation is expected to occur. SCE believes that, due to these uncertainties, it is reasonably possible that cleanup costs at the identified material sites and immaterial sites could exceed its recorded liability by up to million and million, respectively. The upper limit of this range of costs was estimated using assumptions least favorable to SCE among a range of reasonably possible outcomes. SCE expects to clean up and mitigate its identified sites over a period of up to years. Remediation costs for each of the next 5 years are expected to range from million to million. Costs incurred for years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were million, million and million, respectively, and were included in the Operation and maintenance expense on the consolidated statements of income. Based upon the CPUC s regulatory treatment of environmental remediation costs incurred at SCE, SCE believes that costs ultimately recorded will not materially affect its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. There can be no assurance, however, that future developments, including additional information about existing sites or the identification of new sites, will not require material revisions to estimates. Nuclear Insurance Federal law limits public offsite liability claims for bodily injury and property damage from a nuclear incident to the amount of available financial protection, which is currently approximately billion for Palo Verde and million for San Onofre. As of January 1, 2021, SCE and other owners of San Onofre and Palo Verde have purchased the maximum private primary insurance available million) through a Facility Form issued by American Nuclear Insurers ANI ). In the case of San Onofre, the balance is covered by a US Government indemnity. In the case of Palo Verde, the balance is covered by a loss sharing program among nuclear reactor licensees. If a nuclear incident at any licensed reactor in the United States, which is participating in the loss sharing program, results in claims and/or costs which exceed the primary insurance at that plant site, all participating nuclear reactor licensees could be required to contribute their share of the liability in the form of a deferred premium. The ANI Facility Form coverage includes broad liability protection for bodily injury or offsite property damage caused by the nuclear energy hazard at San Onofre or Palo Verde, or while radioactive material is in transit to or from San Onofre or Palo Verde. The Facility Form, however, includes several exclusions. First, it excludes onsite property damage

 million. Industry losses covered by this program could reduce limits available to SCE. Third, offsite environmental costs arising out of government orders or directives, including those issued under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as CERCLA, are excluded, with minor exceptions from clearly identifiable accidents. SCE withdrew from participation in the secondary insurance pool for San Onofre for offsite liability insurance effective January 5, 2018. Based on its ownership interests in Palo Verde, SCE could be required to pay a maximum of approximately million per nuclear incident for future incidents. However, it would have to pay no more than approximately million per future incident in any one year. SCE could be required to pay a maximum of approximately million per nuclear incident and a maximum of million per year per incident for liabilities arising from events prior to January 5, 2018, although SCE is not aware of any such events. If the public liability limit above is insufficient, federal law contemplates that additional funds may be appropriated by Congress. This could include an additional assessment on all licensed reactor operators as a measure for raising further federal revenue. SCE is a member of NEIL, a mutual insurance company owned by entities with nuclear facilities. NEIL provides insurance for nuclear property damage, including damages caused by acts of terrorism up to specified limits, and for accidental outages for active facilities. The amount of nuclear property damage insurance purchased for San Onofre and Palo Verde exceeds the minimum federal requirement of million and billion, respectively. These policies include coverage for decontamination liability. Additional outage insurance covers part of replacement power expenses during an accident-related nuclear unit outage. The accidental outage insurance at San Onofre has been canceled as a result of the permanent retirement, but that insurance continues to be in effect at Palo Verde. If NEIL losses at any nuclear facility covered by the arrangement were to exceed the accumulated funds for these insurance programs, SCE could be assessed retrospective premium adjustments of up to approximately million per year. Insurance premiums are charged to operating expense. to for PPA leases, to for office leases, and to for the remaining other operating leases.

Subsequent to the change, stock issued through the 401(k) defined contribution savings plan were dividend payments made in the form of additional common stock. At-the-Market Program In the third quarter of 2022, Edison International filed a prospectus supplement and executed several distribution agreements with certain sales agents to establish an at-the-market ATM program under which it may sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to million. As of December 31, 2022, sales had occurred and Edison International has no obligation to sell the remaining shares available under the ATM program. Preferred Stock Issuances In 2021, Edison International issued shares of Fixed-Rate Reset Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, and shares of its Fixed-Rate Reset Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, each with a liquidation value of per share. The dividends are payable on a semi-annual basis, commencing September 15, 2021 and March 15, 2022, respectively. The dividend rate will be reset every beginning on March 15, 2026 and March 15, 2027, respectively, to equal the then-current U.S. Treasury rate plus a spread of and , respectively. The net proceeds of billion were used to repay commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes, including making a total of million equity contributions to SCE. Edison International may, at its option, redeem its preferred stock in whole or in part during certain periods of time prior to each of the dividend reset dates at a price equal to per share plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends. Edison International may also, at its option, redeem the preferred stocks in whole but not in part at a price equal to per share plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends within a certain period of time following any change in the criteria rating agencies use that would have adverse effects on the equity credit attributed by rating agencies to the preferred stocks. The preferred stocks rank senior to Edison International s common stock with respect to dividends rights and distribution rights upon liquidation. The preferred stocks are not subject to any mandatory sinking fund, retirement fund, purchase fund or other similar provisions. Holders of the shares of the preferred stocks do not have the right to require Edison International to repurchase or redeem shares of the preferred stocks. Preferred and Preference Stock of Utility SCE s authorized shares are: cumulative preferred million shares, cumulative preferred million shares and preference with par value million shares. There are dividends in arrears for the preferred or preference shares. During 2020, SCE redeemed million of cumulative preferred stock consisting of all of the outstanding shares of the Series, Series, Series and the Series at a price of , , and , respectively. SCE recorded a million loss on the redemption of the preferred stock as an adjustment to net income available to common stockholders. preferred shares were issued or redeemed in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. There is no sinking fund requirement for redemptions or repurchases of preferred shares.

 Subsidiaries of Edison International SCE Public Utility SCE is an investor-owned public utility primarily engaged in the business of supplying and delivering electricity through SCE s electrical infrastructure to an approximately 50,000 square-mile area of southern California. SCE serves approximately 5 million customers in its service area. SCE s total number of customers by class were as follows: 

(in thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Residential 4,541 4,499 4,531 Commercial 609 605 577 Industrial 6 7 9 Public authorities 69 70 46 Agricultural and other 19 20 20 Total 5,244 5,201 5,183 In 2022, SCE s total operating revenue of 17.2 billion was derived as follows: 41.9 commercial customers, 39.9 residential customers, 4.0 public authorities, 3.0 industrial customers, 4.0 agricultural and other, and 7.2 other operating revenue. CPUC and FERC rates decouple authorized revenue from the volume of electricity sales and the price of energy procured so that SCE has the opportunity to receive revenue equal to amounts authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies. As a result, the volume of electricity sold to customers does not have a direct impact on SCE s financial results. See SCE Overview of Ratemaking Process CPUC and FERC for further information. Edison Energy Energy Service Provider Edison Energy which is engaged in the competitive business of providing decarbonization and energy solutions to commercial, institutional and industrial customers in North America and Europe. Edison Energy aims to provide energy solutions that address cost, carbon and complex choices for their customers. To date, investments in Edison Energy are not material to be reported as a business segment. Regulation of Edison International as a Holding Company As a public utility holding company, Edison International is subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act. The Public Utility Holding Company Act primarily obligates Edison International and its utility subsidiaries to provide access to their books and records to the FERC and the CPUC for ratemaking purposes. Edison International is not a public utility and its capital structure is not regulated by the CPUC. The 1988 CPUC decision authorizing SCE to reorganize into a holding company structure, however, imposed certain obligations on Edison International and its affiliates. These obligations include a requirement that SCE s dividend policy continue to be established by SCE s Board of Directors as though SCE were a stand-alone utility company, and that the capital requirements of SCE, as deemed to be necessary to meet SCE s electricity service obligations, shall receive first priority from the Boards of Directors of Edison International and SCE. The CPUC has also promulgated Affiliate Transaction Rules, which, among other requirements, prohibit holding companies from (1) being used as a conduit to provide non-public information to a utility s affiliates and (2) causing or abetting a utility s violation of the rules, including providing preferential treatment to its affiliates. Human Capital At December 31, 2022, Edison International had an aggregate of 13,388 employees (excluding interns and employees on leaves of absence), of which 12,831 were full-time employees of SCE or its subsidiaries. In addition to employees, SCE s workforce includes a significant number of contract workers who support SCE s operations. Among these contract 
 143 

Table of Contents 
 workers are Safety Tier 1 Contractors. SCE estimates, based on contractors self-reported hours worked and a 2,080-hour work year, that there were approximately 10,000 full-time equivalent Safety Tier 1 Contractors supporting SCE operations (other than for decommissioning activities at San Onofre) during 2022. All Safety Tier 1 Contractors engaged in decommissioning activities at San Onofre are managed by the DGC. In addition to Safety Tier 1 Contractors, SCE also uses other contract workers to support its transmission and distribution, vegetation management, information technology and customer service activities. Approximately 3,900 of SCE s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers IBEW ). In February 2023, the IBEW membership ratified new collective bargaining agreements for the period January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025. In addition, a substantial number of SCE s contract workers are also unionized. Edison International focuses on various human capital measures and objectives in managing its business, including measures and objectives related to safety, diversity, equity and inclusion and workforce continuity. Safety Safety is the first of Edison International s core values. Edison International is committed to building and maintaining a safe environment for its employees, contract workers, customers and the public. Over the past several years, Edison International s efforts to improve workforce safety have included increased focus on, and investment in, maturing a culture of safety ownership among its workforce that empowers employees and contract workers to own their safety, support their team members safety and contribute to a safe work environment. Edison International makes efforts to eliminate fatalities and serious injuries and reduce all injuries. For instance, all full-time employees are provided with regular safety-related training, particularly for those who work in proximity to high-voltage electrical equipment and other high-risk activities. SCE implemented more safety requirements for both prime contractors and subcontractors in 2021 and continues to prioritize safety. Edison International uses employee safety culture assessments to measure its progress relative to improving its safety culture. Edison International also uses various measures to assess safety performance, including, without limitation, fatalities and serious injury rates for employees and contract workers.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Edison International is committed to developing a team that reflects the broad diversity of the customers and communities it serves. At Edison International, on average, employees in the same role receive equal pay for equal work. Similar to broader society, when looking at gender or race/ethnicity-specific groups across Edison International without regard to role, female employees and Black and Hispanic employees do not receive comparable pay to male and White employees, respectively, due to lower representation of female, Black and Hispanic employees in higher paying jobs.

To support Edison International s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, Executives and Leaders are offered training and tools to promote diverse representation throughout their teams. In addition, Edison International evaluates whether hiring processes include diverse candidates and diverse sets of decision makers. In addition to measuring diversity, Edison International also uses various other measures to assess success of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, including without limitation, monitoring hiring, promotion and turnover rates for diverse employees. Workforce Continuity Edison International is committed to identifying and developing the talents of its workforce and takes a variety of steps to increase employee engagement and provide employees opportunities for growth. Employees are provided with training opportunities, including an onboarding program, technical training, required ethics and compliance training and optional trainings to support career development. SCE estimates that over 95 of active SCE employees completed all assigned training required to be completed in 2022 as part of SCE s enterprise-wide training program. Employees may also be required to take additional trainings based on their job function. Employees receive competitive compensation packages which include a wide selection of health plans, a 401(k) savings plan with a company match, wellness programs and initiatives, tuition reimbursement, competitive vacation/holiday program, professional development, volunteer programs, employee assistance program, and a philanthropy and matching contribution program. Edison International uses various measures to assess employee engagement and satisfaction, including, without limitation, conducting regular employee engagement surveys and monitoring turnover. Edison International Parent and SCE s combined Turnover Rate was 7.6 and 7.5 in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

 Executives engage in succession planning for leadership positions within the organization. Edison International s and SCE s Boards of Directors also engage in succession planning and talent development discussions for senior officers. Edison International s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Report and Sustainability Report are available at http://www.edison.com/sustainability. The reports and any other information contained on, or connected to, this website are not deemed part of, and are not incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K . Insurance Edison International maintains a property and casualty insurance program for itself and its subsidiaries and excess liability insurance covering liabilities to third parties for bodily injury or property damage resulting from operations. These policies are subject to specific retentions, sub-limits and deductibles, which are comparable to those carried by other utility companies of similar size. Catastrophic events, such as hurricanes and storms, that do not impact Edison directly have had an impact, and can have future impacts, on insurance markets overall. While SCE maintains insurance relating to cybersecurity events, such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may be insufficient to offset any losses, costs or damage experienced. SCE also has separate insurance programs for nuclear property and liability, workers compensation and wildfires. For further information on nuclear and wildfire insurance, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies Contingencies. SCE Regulation CPUC The CPUC has the authority to regulate, among other things, retail rates, utility distribution-level equipment and assets, energy purchases on behalf of retail customers, SCE capital structure, rate of return, issuance of securities, disposition of utility assets and facilities, oversight of nuclear decommissioning funding and costs, and aspects of the transmission system planning, site identification and construction, including safety and environmental mitigation. The CPUC can assess penalties on any public utility that violates or fails to comply with its rules and requirements, of up to 100,000, for each offense, which could be assessed daily for a continuing violation. In November 2020, the CPUC adopted a new Enforcement Policy authorizing the staff of the CPUC to draft proposed Administrative Consent Orders and Administrative Enforcement Orders, both of which can include fines and serve as alternatives to issuance of a citation or formal investigation proceeding, for CPUC consideration and approval. FERC The FERC has the authority to regulate wholesale rates as well as other matters, including unbundled transmission service pricing, rate of return, accounting practices, and licensing of hydroelectric projects. The FERC also has jurisdiction over a portion of the retail rates and associated rate design. CAISO The CAISO operates a wholesale energy market primarily in California through which competing electricity generators offer their electricity output to market participants, including electricity retailers. SCE has placed its transmission system under the operational control of the CAISO. Major transmission projects required for reliability, economic and other policy reasons are identified and approved through the CAISO s annual transmission planning process. Depending on the nature of the project identified, it may be assigned to SCE or set for competitive bid.

 The CAISO is conducting transmission planning studies to identify transmission needed to meet a 46 million metric ton GHG emissions target by 2030 set by the CPUC for California s electricity sector to support California s target of reducing overall GHG emissions statewide by 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. NERC The FERC assigned administrative responsibility to the NERC to establish and enforce reliability standards and critical infrastructure protection standards, which protect the bulk power system against potential disruptions from cyber and physical security breaches. The critical infrastructure protection standards focus on controlling access to critical physical and cyber security assets, including supervisory control and data acquisition systems for the electric grid. The reliability standards define the requirements for planning and operating the bulk power system. Compliance with these standards is mandatory. As of the date of this filing, the maximum penalty that may be levied for violating a NERC reliability or critical infrastructure protection standard is approximately 1.5 million per violation, per day. SCE has formal cyber security and physical security programs that cover SCE s information technology and operational technology systems, including customer data. Program staff is engaged with industry groups as well as public-private initiatives to reduce risk and to strengthen the security and reliability of SCE s systems and infrastructure. OEIS Effective July 1, 2021, the OEIS became the successor to the CPUC s Wildfire Safety Division WSD ), and was vested with the powers, duties, and responsibilities of the WSD, as well as other statutory authority. OEIS is responsible for, among other things, approving and overseeing compliance with WMPs. As part of overseeing WMP compliance, OEIS can issue notices of violation and recommend that the Commission pursue an enforcement action against an electrical corporation for noncompliance with its approved WMP. Other OEIS tasks include conducting safety culture assessments, approving executive compensation structures, and issuing safety certifications. Nuclear Power Plant Regulation The NRC has jurisdiction with respect to the safety of San Onofre and Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Stations. The NRC regulates commercial nuclear power plants through licensing, oversight and inspection, performance assessment, and enforcement of its requirements. In June 2013, SCE decided to permanently retire and decommission San Onofre. The NRC regulates the decommissioning of San Onofre. For further information, see Liquidity and Capital Resources SCE Decommissioning of San Onofre in the MD A. Other Regulatory Agencies The construction, planning and project site identification of SCE s transmission lines and substation facilities require the compliance with various laws and approval of many governmental agencies in addition to the CPUC and FERC. These include various state regulatory agencies depending on the project location; the CAISO; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other environmental, land management and resource agencies such as the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Forest Service, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the California Coastal Commission; and the State Water Resources Control Board. In addition, to the extent that SCE transmission line projects pass through lands owned or controlled by Native American tribes, consent and approval from the affected tribes and the Bureau of Indian Affairs are also necessary for the project to proceed.

 Compliance with Government Regulations SCE incurs significant costs to comply with government regulations. These costs, which include operation and maintenance expenses and capital expenses, including without limitation: costs incurred to maintain wildfire insurance coverage required under AB 1054; comply with environmental regulations, including licensing requirements, regulations governing California s renewable energy standards and regulations governing the decommissioning of SONGS; land use and construction regulations; privacy and cybersecurity regulations; and Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations. SCE also incurs operation and maintenance expenses and capital expenses to comply with requirements set forth in various regulatory decisions, including, costs incurred to implement its approved capital projects and safety programs such as its WMPs. Most costs incurred by SCE to comply with government regulations are authorized in its CPUC and FERC general rate cases and, are therefore, recovered through electric rates. To the extent SCE incurs costs to comply with government regulations above those that are authorized, or prior to obtaining authorization, for recovery through rates (for instance certain costs incurred in line with SCE s obligations under its WMPs and tracked in wildfire mitigation-related memorandum accounts), SCE will seek recovery of such costs through electric rates. There is no assurance that SCE will be allowed to fully recover these costs. For further information on wildfire mitigation and wildfire insurance costs, see Liquidity and Capital Resources SCE Regulatory Proceedings Wildfire Related Regulatory Proceedings. SCE earns a rate of return on its authorized capital expenditures included in its rate base. Approximately 1.6 billion of spending by SCE on wildfire risk mitigation capital expenditures made after August 1, 2019 are not included in rate base under the terms of AB 1054. Overview of Ratemaking Process CPUC Revenue authorized by the CPUC through GRC proceedings is intended to provide SCE a reasonable opportunity to recover its costs and earn a return on its net investments in generation and distribution assets and general plant (also referred to as rate base on a forecast basis. Revenue is authorized through quadrennial GRC proceedings where the CPUC sets an annual revenue requirement for the base year which is made up of the operation and maintenance costs, depreciation, taxes and a return consistent with the authorized cost of capital (discussed below). In the GRC proceedings, the CPUC also generally approves the level of capital spending on a forecast basis. Following the base year, the revenue requirements for the remaining three years will be set by a methodology established in the GRC proceeding, which has generally, among other items, included annual allowances for escalation in operation and maintenance costs and additional changes in capital-related investments. SCE s 2021 GRC has authorized revenue requirements for 2021, 2022 and 2023 of 6.9 billion, 7.3 billion and 7.7 billion. In 2022, SCE made additional filings in the 2021 GRC proceeding seeking a revenue requirement of 8.6 billion for 2024. For further discussion of the 2021 GRC, see Liquidity and Capital Resources SCE Regulatory Proceedings 2021 General Rate Case Track 4 in the MD A. SCE expects to file its 2025 GRC application with the CPUC in May 2023, for the four-year period of 2025 2028. By May 15 in the year preceding each GRC application filing date, SCE is required to file a Risk Assessment and Mitigation Phase RAMP application with the CPUC to provide information about SCE s assessment of its key safety risks and its proposed programs and spending for mitigating those risks. SCE filed its RAMP application for the 2025 GRC in May 2022.The information developed during the RAMP informs SCE s proposed projects and funding requests in the subsequent phase of the GRC. The CPUC regulates SCE s cost of capital, including its capital structure and authorized rates of return. SCE s currently authorized capital structure is 43 long-term debt, 5 preferred equity and 52 common equity. SCE s currently 
 148 

Table of Contents 
 authorized cost of capital for 2023, 2024 and 2025 consists of: cost of long-term debt of 4.39 , cost of preferred equity of 6.50 and ROE of 10.05 and includes an adjustment mechanism set by the CPUC that could adjust authorized cost of capital between SCE s cost of capital proceedings. Based on the capital structure and cost factors discussed above, SCE s weighted average return on rate base will be 7.44 for 2023. The CPUC also continued the cost of capital adjustment mechanism for 2023, 2024, and 2025, but opened a second phase in the proceeding to consider proposed changes to the mechanism. The benchmark value for the mechanism for SCE beginning in 2023 is the 12-month, October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022, average Moody s Baa utility bond yield of 4.37 . Under the cost of capital adjustment mechanism, if the difference between the benchmark and the average of the same index for the 12-month period to September 30, 2023 exceeds 100-basis points, SCE s CPUC-authorized ROE would be adjusted by half the amount of the difference (up or down) and SCE s costs of long-term debt and preferred equity would also be adjusted to reflect the then current embedded costs and projected interest rates effective January 1, 2024. For further information see Management Overview Cost of Capital Applications. CPUC rates decouple authorized revenue from the volume of electricity sales so that SCE receives revenue equal to amounts authorized. Differences between amounts collected and authorized levels are either collected from or refunded to customers, and, therefore, such differences do not impact operating revenue. Accordingly, SCE is neither benefited nor burdened by the volume of retail electricity sales. Cost-recovery balancing accounts track the difference between actual expenditures associated with the account, revenue authorized for recovery by the CPUC (authorized revenue requirement), and the actual revenues collected within customer rates to cover those specific expenditures. These balancing accounts are used to track and recover, among other things, SCE s decoupled costs of fuel and purchased power, as well as certain operation and maintenance expenses. SCE earns no return on these activities and although differences between forecasted and actual costs do not impact earnings, such differences do impact cash flows and can change rapidly. SCE also has capital-related balancing accounts on which it earns a return, such as the pole loading balancing account. Costs tracked in balancing accounts are not subject to after-the-fact reasonableness review unless the balancing accounts are one-way balancing accounts or otherwise subject to a cost cap. SCE uses balancing accounts for cost recovery of authorized wildfire insurance expenses, WCCP expenditures up to 110 of authorized WCCP amounts and up to 115 of authorized vegetation management expenses. SCE also has memorandum accounts, which track costs above authorized levels eligible for cost recovery upon a future reasonableness review. Under the 2021 GRC final decision SCE can seek recovery of wildfire insurance expenses above authorized levels, WCCP amounts above 110 of authorized levels and vegetation management expenses above 115 of authorized levels through reasonableness review applications. These incremental amounts are tracked in memorandum accounts. SCE s cost-recovery mechanism for its fuel and purchased power-related costs is facilitated in three main balancing accounts, the ERRA, the PABA, and the NSGBA. For all three accounts, SCE sets rates based on an annual forecast of the costs that it expects to incur during the subsequent year. In addition, the CPUC has established a trigger mechanism for the ERRA and the PABA. The trigger mechanism requires SCE to request an expeditious rate change if the sum of the ERRA balance and the bundled service customers pro-rata share of the PABA balance exceeds 4 of SCE s prior year generation rate revenue and SCE does not expect the aggregate overcollection or undercollection to fall below 5 of SCE s prior year generation rate revenue within 120 days. For 2023, SCE estimates the 4 and 5 trigger amounts to be approximately 216 million and 270 million, respectively. 
 149 

Table of Contents 
 For 2022, the 4 and 5 trigger amounts were approximately 200 million and 250 million, respectively. See Liquidity and Capital Resources SCE Regulatory Proceedings ERRA Proceeding for information regarding SCE filing an application to advice the CPUC that SCE s undercollections had exceeded the trigger amount as of September 30, 2022. The majority of fuel and purchased power procurement-related costs eligible for recovery through cost-recovery rates are pre-approved by the CPUC through specific decisions and a procurement plan with predefined standards that establish the eligibility for cost-recovery. If such costs are subsequently found to be non-compliant with this procurement plan, then this could negatively impact SCE s earnings and cash flows. In addition, the CPUC retrospectively reviews outages associated with utility-owned generation and SCE s power procurement contract administration activities through the annual ERRA review proceeding. A CPUC finding that SCE was unreasonable or imprudent with respect to its utility-owned generation outages and contract administration activities, could negatively impact SCE s earnings and cash flows. The ERRA review proceeding is also used as a venue to review costs in various memorandum and balancing accounts including the Pole Loading and Deteriorated Pole Programs Balancing Account. A California law adopted in 2022 has directed the CPUC to develop a definition of energy affordability and to use energy affordability metrics to guide the development of any protections, incentives, discounts, or new programs to assist residential customers facing hardships or disconnections due to electricity or gas bills and to assess the impact of proposed rate increases on different types of residential customers. FERC Transmission capital and operating costs that are prudently incurred, including a return on its net investment in transmission assets, are recovered through revenue authorized by the FERC. Since 2012, SCE has used a formula rate to determine SCE s FERC transmission revenue requirement, including its construction work in progress (CWIP) revenue requirement. Under operation of the formula rate, transmission revenue will be updated to actual cost of service annually. The transmission revenue requirement and rates are updated each December, to reflect a forecast of costs for the upcoming rate period, as well as a true up of the transmission revenue to actual costs incurred by SCE in the prior calendar year on its formula rate. The FERC ROE is currently 10.3 . For further information on the FERC formula rates, related transmission revenue requirements and rate changes, see Liquidity and Capital Resources SCE Regulatory Proceedings 2023 FERC Formula Rate Annual Update in the MD A. Retail Rates Structure and Residential Rate Design To develop retail rates, the authorized revenue requirements are allocated among all customer classes (residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural and street lighting) on a functional basis (i.e., generation, distribution, transmission, etc.). Specific rate components are designed to recover the authorized revenue allocated to each customer class. SCE has a two-tier residential rate structure. The first tier is priced at below-average cost and is intended to cover the customer s essential electricity needs. The second tier is priced at 25 more than the first tier. The CPUC has ordered a transition from tiered to t ime-of-use TOU rates for most residential customers unless they opt to stay on the tiered rate structure. Under a TOU rate structure, rates are based on the time of day and the season. TOU rates are typically lower early in the day, overnight, and on the weekends when energy resources are less in demand. SCE completed a multi-year transition of most customers to TOU rates in June 2022, and, as of December 31, 2022, approximately 60 percent of residential customers are on TOU rates. To recover a portion of the fixed costs of serving no- or low-usage residential customers, SCE assesses both fixed charges of less than 1 per month, and a minimum charge of 10 per month 5 for low-income customers). There is currently an open proceeding pending at the CPUC where the CPUC is considering establishing an income-graduated fixed charge for residential rates for customers of all investor-owned

 electric utilities. For information on residential rates for customers with renewable generation systems, see Competition below. Purchased Power and Fuel Supply SCE obtains the power, energy, and local grid support needed to serve its customers primarily from purchases from external parties. SCE estimates that approximately 20 of power delivered to SCE s customers in 2022 came from SCE s own generating facilities. Natural Gas Supply SCE requires natural gas to meet contractual obligations for power tolling agreements (power contracts in which SCE has agreed to provide or pay for the natural gas used to generate electricity) and to fuel its Mountainview and peaker plants, which are generation units that operate in response to wholesale market signals related to power prices and reliability needs. The physical natural gas purchased by SCE is sourced in competitive interstate markets at trading points on the SoCalGas local distribution company system and the El Paso pipeline. SoCalGas is the primary provider of intrastate pipeline transportation service to the gas-fueled generation stations that SCE controls. In 2015 2016, SoCalGas experienced a significant natural gas fuel leak at its Aliso Canyon underground gas storage facility. As a result, there continue to be limitations on the use and capability of the facility, and the current available inventory at the Aliso Canyon facility is limited to 60 of maximum capacity. To date, SCE has found that gas storage-use restrictions combined with SoCalGas pipeline maintenance constraints contributed to increased electricity costs for customers but did not impact grid reliability. However, there is no certainty that these restrictions or pipeline constraints will not impact grid reliability in the future. Price increases faced by customers would not affect SCE s earnings because SCE expects recovery of these costs through the ERRA balancing account or other CPUC approved procurement plans. However, these higher prices may impact cash flow due to the timing of those recoveries. For more information on cost-recovery mechanisms, see Overview of Ratemaking Process above. SCE is actively monitoring legislative and regulatory processes that are addressing pipeline and electric grid operations impacted by the Aliso Canyon leak, including an Order Instituting Investigation issued by the CPUC in February 2017 to consider the feasibility of minimizing or eliminating the use of the Aliso Canyon facility. SCE has also made additional procurement efforts to alleviate the impact of the partial closure of Aliso Canyon, including accelerating existing contracts for new capacity, procuring energy storage from third-parties, contracting for design, build, and transfer of utility-owned storage, procuring additional demand response and contracting for firm gas transportation capacity. CAISO Wholesale Energy Market The CAISO operates a wholesale energy market primarily in California through which competing electricity generators offer their electricity output to market participants, including electricity retailers. The CAISO schedules power in hourly increments with hourly prices through a day-ahead market in California and schedules power in fifteen-minute and five-minute increments with fifteen-minute and five-minute prices through two real-time markets that cover California and portions of six neighboring states through the Energy Imbalance Market. Both markets optimize energy procurement, ancillary service procurement, unit commitment and congestion management. SCE participates in the day-ahead and real-time markets for the sale of its own generation and generation under contract purchases for its load requirements. In February 2023 the CAISO Board and the Western Energy Imbalance Market Western EIM Governing Body approved a proposal for an Extended Day-Ahead Market EDAM which, if approved by the FERC, will give utilities in the Western EIM the option of joining a centralized day-ahead market run by the CAISO. The EDAM, if adopted, will give utilities an opportunity to lock in energy prices a day in advance, and thereby substantially avoid volatility in the real-time energy market.

 The CPUC s Resource Adequacy program imposes resource adequacy requirements on load-serving entities like SCE that are designed to provide sufficient resources to the CAISO to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the grid in real time. The CPUC has adopted a central procurement structure in SCE s distribution service area for local resource adequacy that transfers the responsibility for procuring local resource adequacy from other local load-serving entities to SCE, as a central procurement entity CPE for its distribution service area, starting with the 2023 resource adequacy compliance year. Under this structure, while SCE will procure local resource adequacy to meet the local resource adequacy requirement for its distribution service area, other load-serving entities can also procure their own local resources. Load-serving entities that procure their own local resources can: (i) sell the capacity to SCE, (ii) utilize the resources, or (iii) voluntarily show the resources to meet their own needs, thereby reducing the amount of local resource adequacy the CPE will need to procure and reducing the total CPE procurement costs shared by all load-serving entities in that distribution service area. In June 2022, the CPUC reformed the resource adequacy framework by adopting SCE s proposed 24-hour slice of day structure, which addresses the large variations in renewable generation that result in costly over procurement if utilities assess resource need based on periods longer than one hour. Following state-wide rotating outages in August 2020 that impacted a significant number of SCE s customers, the CPUC has taken action towards ensuring reliable electric service in the event that an extreme heat events occur during summer. In June 2021, the CPUC issued a decision requiring at least an aggregate of 11,500 MW of additional net qualifying renewable or zero-emitting capacity to be procured collectively by all of the load-serving entities subject to CAISO. The aggregate additional capacity is required by 2026, with 2,000 MW required by 2023, an additional 6,000 MW required by 2024, an additional 1,500 MW required by 2025, and an additional 2,000 MW required by 2026. SCE s allocation of the requirements is 705 MW by 2023, 2,114 MW by 2024, 529 MW by 2025 and 705 MW by 2026, for a total of 4,052 MW. In January 2023, the CPUC issued a Proposed Decision which, if adopted, would require all of the load-serving entities subject to CAISO to collectively procure an additional 4,000 MW of net qualifying renewable or zero-emitting capacity by 2028. SCE s allocation of the addition 4,000 MW is 1,410 MW. SCE continues to actively pursue and execute various actions to procure addition capacity. For instance, in January 2023, the CPUC approved SCE entering into four lithium-ion battery storage contracts with a total capacity of approximately 619 MW, which are expected to provide approximately 562 MW of capacity towards SCE s allocation of the 11,500 MW requirement. The contracts range from 10-15 years and the projects are expected to be in service in 2023 and 2024. In July 2021, California s Governor issued an Emergency Proclamation related to accelerating construction of new resources ahead of possible summer 2022 shortfalls. Subsequently, the CPUC opened a Phase 2 of its emergency reliability rulemaking proceeding to ensure there is adequate supply and demand management to achieve electrical system reliability in 2022 and 2023. In October 2021, SCE contracted for the construction of utility owned storage at three sites in SCE s service territory with an aggregate capacity of 537.5 MW, which SCE has been advised will be in-service prior to June 2023. See Management Overview Capital Program Utility Owned Storage Projects in the MD A. In December 2021, the CPUC issued a final decision in Phase 2 of its emergency reliability rulemaking proceeding adopting several supply- and demand-side measures to help provide contingency resources with the goal of ensuring that there is adequate electric power in the event of an extreme weather event in the summers of 2022 or 2023, including directing the investor-owned utilities to continue their procurement efforts and endeavor to achieve an effective 20 to 22.5 planning reserve margin for the summers of 2022 and 2023. Competition SCE faces retail competition in the sale of electricity to the extent that federal and California laws permit other sources to provide electricity and related services to retail customers within SCE s service area. While retail competition impacts customer rates it does not impact SCE s earnings activities because the volume of electricity sales is decoupled from authorized revenue. The increased retail competition is from governmental entities formed by cities, counties, and 
 152 

Table of Contents 
 certain other public agencies to generate and/or purchase electricity for their local residents and businesses, known as CCAs. While California law provides only limited opportunities for customers in SCE s service area to choose to purchase power directly from an Electric Service Provider, a limited, phased-in expansion of customer choice Direct Access for nonresidential customers was authorized beginning in 2009, and an additional limited expansion of Direct Access was authorized in 2018. When a customer who had previously taken bundled service from SCE converts to taking retail electricity service from an Electric Service Provider or a CCA, SCE remains that customer s transmission and distribution provider. Other forms of departing load include customer generation, and load that departs SCE service entirely to take electricity service from a publicly owned utility or a tribal utility. California law requires bundled service customers remain financially indifferent to departing load customers and to the mass return of departing load customers in the event of an Electric Service Provider or CCA s failure or other service termination. The CPUC has issued a series of decisions designed to avoid cost shifting in the context of departing load, including revising the PCIA methodology to effectively address the cost shifts to bundled service customers. Investor-owned utilities serve as the default providers of last resort in their respective service areas and can be significantly impacted by the Electric Service Providers or CCAs failing or otherwise exiting the market. In March 2021, the CPUC initiated a rulemaking to examine the risks of catastrophic failures by Electric Service Providers or CCAs on investor-owned utilities and the need for any changes in the regulatory framework to increase consumer protections and financial security requirements, among other measures. As of year-end 2022, SCE had twelve CCAs serving customers in its service territory that represented approximately 27 of SCE s total service load. While one CCA deregistered and exited, two new CCAs implemented and two CCAs expanded in SCE s service territory in 2022. Two expanded CCAs have been approved by the CPUC to serve customers in SCE s service territory in 2023, however one of the implementations is likely to be deregistered. Based on recent load statistics, SCE anticipates that Direct Access and CCA load will be approximately 44 of its total service load by the end of 2023. Customer-owned power generation and storage alternatives, such as rooftop solar facilities and battery systems, are increasingly used by SCE s customers as a result of technological developments, federal and state subsidies, and declining costs of such alternatives. Beginning in 2020, and subject to certain exceptions, all newly built homes in California are required to have solar installations. California legislation passed in 1995 encouraged private residential and commercial investment in renewable energy resources by requiring SCE and other investor-owned utilities to offer a NEM billing option to customers who install eligible power generation systems to supply all or part of their energy needs. NEM customers are interconnected to SCE s grid and credited for the net difference between the electricity SCE supplied to them through the grid and the electricity the customer exported to SCE over a 12-month period. SCE is required to credit the NEM customer for most of the power they sell back to SCE at the retail rate. Through the credit they receive, NEM customers effectively avoid paying certain grid-related costs. NEM customers are also exempted from some non-bypassable, standby and departing load charges and interconnection fees. Electric Service Providers and CCAs are not required by law to offer NEM rates. In January 2016, the CPUC issued a decision adopting a new standard NEM tariff for customers with renewable generation systems. The changes that the CPUC decision made to the existing NEM tariff did not significantly impact the NEM subsidy. Specifically, the decision required customers that take service on SCE s NEM tariff after June 2017 to continue to be compensated at the retail rate, minus certain non-bypassable charges. NEM customers also continued to be exempted from standby and departing load charges but were required to pay a 75 interconnection fee and to select a time-of-use retail rate.

 The effect of these types of competition on SCE generally is to reduce the amount of electricity purchased from SCE by retail customers. Customers who use alternative electricity sources typically continue to utilize and pay for SCE s transmission and distribution services, however, current NEM customers utilize, but do not pay the full cost for, those services. While changes in volume or rates generally do not impact SCE s earnings activities, decreased retail electricity sales by SCE has the effect of increasing utility rates because the costs of the distribution grid are not currently borne by all customers that benefit from its use. See Risk Factors Risks Relating to Southern California Edison Company Competitive and Market Risks. In August 2020, the CPUC initiated a rulemaking to develop a successor to the NEM tariffs. In December 2022, the CPUC issued final decision reducing the current NEM subsidy by decoupling export compensation from the retail rate. Under the final decision, the CPUC deferred consideration of whether to assess a grid participation charge to address the costs participating customers avoid by reducing the electricity they purchase from SCE and whether to adopt other mechanisms that would allow SCE to recover its cost of service and the costs of many public policy programs to another pending proceeding. The final decision also provides an enhanced subsidy for lower income customers and customers who pair rooftop solar with energy storage systems. The final decision does not apply to existing NEM customers until after they have completed twenty years on their existing NEM tariff, at which time they will move to the new, reduced tariff. In the area of transmission infrastructure, SCE has experienced increased competition from independent transmission providers under the FERC s transmission planning requirements rules, effective in 2011, that removed the incumbent public utility transmission owners federally-based right of first refusal to construct certain new transmission facilities and mandated regional and interregional transmission planning. Regional entities, such as independent system operators, have processes for regional and interregional transmission planning and the competitive solicitation and selection of developers (including incumbent utilities) to build and own certain types of new transmission projects. The CAISO has held competitive solicitations pursuant to these rules and independent service providers were selected. Properties SCE supplies electricity to its customers through extensive transmission and distribution networks. Its transmission facilities, which are located primarily in California but also in Nevada and Arizona, deliver power from generating sources to the distribution network and consist of approximately 13,000 circuit-miles of lines ranging from 55 kV to 500 kV and approximately 80 transmission substations. SCE s distribution system, which takes power from distribution substations to customers, consists of approximately 38,000 circuit-miles of overhead lines, approximately 31,000 circuit-miles of underground lines and approximately 730 distribution substations. At December 31, 2022, SCE had ownership interests in generating and energy storage facilities, primarily located in California, with approximately 7,000 MW of net physical capacity, of which SCE s pro-rata share is approximately 3,000 MW. SCE s pro rata share includes approximately 73 MW of capacity from facilities that were not operational or out of service at December 31, 2022, other than for routine maintenance purposes, and excludes retired facilities. In addition to its current facilities, in October 2021, SCE contracted for the construction of utility owned storage at three sites in SCE s service territory with an aggregate capacity of 537.5 MW, which SCE has been advised will be in-service prior to June 2023. See Management Overview Capital Program Utility Owned Storage Projects in the MD A. Certain of SCE s substations, and portions of its transmission, distribution and communication systems are located on lands owned by the federal, state or local governments under licenses, permits, easements or leases, or on public streets or highways pursuant to franchises. Certain of the documents evidencing such rights obligate SCE, under specified circumstances and at its expense, to relocate such transmission, distribution, and communication facilities located on lands owned or controlled by federal, state, or local governments.

 SCE owns and operates hydroelectric plants and related reservoirs, the majority of which are located in whole or in part on U.S.-owned lands and are subject to FERC licenses. Slightly over half of these plants have FERC licenses that expire at various times through 2046. FERC licenses impose numerous restrictions and obligations on SCE, including the right of the United States to acquire projects upon payment of specified compensation. When existing licenses expire, the FERC has the authority to issue new licenses to third parties that have filed competing license applications, but only if their license application is superior to SCE s and then only upon payment of specified compensation to SCE. New licenses issued to SCE are expected to contain more restrictions and obligations than the expired licenses because laws enacted since the existing licenses were issued require the FERC to give environmental objectives greater consideration in the licensing process. In addition, SCE expects additional opposition to new licenses by environmental stakeholder groups. If, in the future, SCE decides to, or is forced to, decommission one or more hydroelectric projects, the costs related to the decommissioning will be substantial. The CPUC approved SCE recovering a portion of estimated of decommissioning costs for hydroelectric projects in the 2021 GRC. Substantially all of SCE s properties are subject to the lien of a trust indenture securing first and refunding mortgage bonds. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 5. Debt and Credit Agreements. Seasonality Due to warm weather during the summer months and SCE s rate design, operating revenue during the third quarter of each year is generally higher than the other quarters. However, as discussed above, SCE earnings are not affected by changes in retail electricity sales. See Overview of Ratemaking Process above. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES Wildfires in SCE s territory, including those where SCE s equipment may be alleged to be associated with the fire s ignition, have caused loss of life and substantial damage in recent years. Multiple factors have contributed to increased wildfire activity and faster progression of wildfires across SCE s service territory and in other areas of California. These include the buildup of dry vegetation in areas severely impacted by years of historic drought, lack of adequate clearing of hazardous fuels by responsible parties, higher temperatures, lower humidity, increased incidence of dry lightning, and strong Santa Ana winds. At the same time that wildfire risk has been increasing in Southern California, residential and commercial development has occurred and is occurring in some of the highest-risk areas. Such factors can increase the likelihood and extent of wildfires. SCE has determined that approximately 27 of its service territory is in areas identified as high fire risk. California has experienced unprecedented weather conditions in recent years due to climate change, and SCE s service territory remains susceptible to additional wildfire activity in 2023 and beyond. The worsening weather and fuel conditions across California increase the likelihood of wildfires, including those where SCE s equipment may be alleged to be associated with the fire s ignition. In response to worsening conditions and increased wildfire activity over the past several years, SCE has been focused on developing and implementing plans aimed at reducing the risk of SCE equipment contributing to the ignition of wildfires, from its 2018 Gris Safety and Resiliency Program to its WMPs. In addition, California has increased its investment in wildfire prevention and fire suppression capabilities. Multiple lawsuits related to wildfire events have been initiated against SCE and Edison International. For further information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 12.

 Recovery of Wildfire-Related Costs Pre-AB 1054 Cost Recovery California courts have previously found investor-owned utilities to be strictly liable for property damage, regardless of fault, by applying the theory of inverse condemnation when a utility s facilities were determined to be a substantial cause of a wildfire that caused the property damage. The rationale stated by these courts for applying this theory to investor-owned utilities is that property damages resulting from a public improvement, such as the distribution of electricity, can be spread across the larger community that benefited from such improvement through recovery of uninsured wildfire-related costs in electric rates. However, in November 2017, the CPUC issued a decision denying SDG E s request to include in its rates uninsured wildfire-related costs arising from several 2007 wildfires, finding that SDG E did not meet the prudency standard because it did not prudently manage and operate its facilities prior to or at the outset of the 2007 wildfires. In July 2018, the CPUC denied both SDG E s application for rehearing on its cost recovery request and a joint application for rehearing filed by SCE and PG E limited to the applicability of inverse condemnation principles in the same proceeding. The California Court of Appeal, the California Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court have denied SDG E s petitions for review of the CPUC s denial of SDG E s application. 2019 Wildfire Legislation In July 2019, AB 1054 was signed by the Governor of California and became effective immediately. The summary of the wildfire legislation below is based on SCE s interpretation of AB 1054. AB 1054 Prudency Standard Under AB 1054, the CPUC must apply a revised standard when assessing the prudency of a utility in connection with a request for recovery of wildfire costs for wildfires ignited after July 12, 2019. Under AB 1054, the CPUC is required to find a utility to be prudent if the utility s conduct related to the ignition was consistent with actions that a reasonable utility would have undertaken under similar circumstances, at the relevant point in time, and based on the information available at that time. Prudent conduct under the AB 1054 standard is not limited to the optimum practice, method, or act to the exclusion of others, but rather encompasses a spectrum of possible practices, methods, or acts consistent with utility system needs, the interest of the ratepayers, and the requirements of governmental agencies. AB 1054 also clarifies that the CPUC may determine that wildfire costs may be recoverable, in whole or in part, by taking into account factors within and outside the utility s control, including humidity, temperature, and winds. Further, utilities with a valid safety certification will be presumed to have acted prudently related to a wildfire ignition unless a party in the cost recovery proceeding creates serious doubt as to the reasonableness of the utility s conduct, at which time, the burden shifts back to the utility to prove its conduct was prudent. If a utility does not have a valid safety certification, it will have the burden to prove, based on a preponderance of evidence, that its conduct was prudent. The new prudency standard will survive the termination of the Wildfire Insurance Fund. Utilities participating in the Wildfire Insurance Fund that are found to be prudent are not required to reimburse the fund for amounts withdrawn from the fund and can recover wildfire costs through electric rates if the fund has been exhausted. Wildfire Insurance Fund AB 1054 provided for the Wildfire Insurance Fund to reimburse a utility for payment of third-party damage claims arising from certain wildfires that exceed, in aggregate in a calendar year, the greater of 1.0 billion or the insurance coverage required to be maintained under AB 1054. The Wildfire Insurance Fund was established in September 2019 and is available for claims related to wildfires ignited after July 12, 2019 that are determined by the responsible government investigatory agency to have been caused by a utility.

Table of Contents 
 SCE and SDG E collectively made their initial contributions totaling approximately 2.7 billion (SCE share is 2.4 billion) to the Wildfire Insurance Fund in September 2019. Upon its emergence from bankruptcy, on July 1, 2020, PG E made its initial contribution of approximately 4.8 billion to the Wildfire Insurance Fund. PG E, SCE and SDG E are also collectively expected to make aggregate contributions of approximately 3.0 billion (SCE share is 950 million) to the Wildfire Insurance Fund through annual contributions to the fund over a 10-year period by no later than January 1 of each year, of which they have made three annual contributions totaling approximately 1.2 billion (SCE share is approximately 380 million). In addition to PG E s, SCE s and SDG E s contributions to the Wildfire Insurance Fund, PG E, SCE and SDG E are expected to collect 6.1 billion, 6.1 billion and 1.3 billion, respectively, from their customers over a 15-year period through a dedicated rate component. The amount collected from customers may be directly contributed to the Wildfire Insurance Fund or used to support the issuance of up to 10.5 billion in bonds by the California Department of Water Resources, the proceeds of which would be contributed to the fund. In addition to funding contributions to the Wildfire Insurance Fund, the amount collected from utility customers will pay for, among other things, any interest and financing costs related to any bonds that are issued by the California Department of Water Resources to support the contributions to the Wildfire Insurance Fund. SCE s contributions to the Wildfire Insurance Fund will not be recoverable through electric rates and will be excluded from the measurement of SCE s CPUC-jurisdictional authorized capital structure. SCE will also not be entitled to cost recovery for any borrowing costs incurred in connection with its contributions to the Wildfire Insurance Fund. For information on the accounting impact of SCE s contributions to the Wildfire Insurance Fund see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Initial and annual contributions to the wildfire insurance fund established pursuant to California Assembly Bill 1054 in this report. Reimbursement from Wildfire Insurance Fund and AB 1054 Liability Cap Participating investor-owned utilities will be reimbursed from the Wildfire Insurance Fund for eligible claims, subject to the fund administrator s review. SCE will reimburse the fund for any withdrawn amounts if SCE receives payment of such amounts under an indemnification agreement or from an insurance provider or other third-party. SCE will also be required to reimburse the fund for withdrawn amounts that the CPUC disallows, subject to the AB 1054 Liability Cap. If the utility has maintained a valid safety certification and its actions or inactions that resulted in the wildfire are not found to constitute conscious or willful disregard of the rights and safety of others, the aggregate requirement to reimburse the fund over a trailing three calendar year period is capped at 20 of the equity portion of the utility s transmission and distribution rate base in the year of the prudency determination. Based on SCE s forecasted weighted-average 2023 transmission and distribution rate base, excluding general plant and intangibles, and using the equity portion of SCE s CPUC authorized capital structure of 52 , SCE s requirement to reimburse the Wildfire Insurance Fund for eligible claims disallowed in 2023 would be capped at approximately 3.8 billion. SCE will not be allowed to recover borrowing costs incurred to reimburse the fund for amounts that the CPUC disallows. The Wildfire Insurance Fund and, consequently, the AB 1054 Liability Cap will terminate when the administrator determines that the fund has been exhausted. Safety Certification and Wildfire Mitigation Plan Under AB 1054, SCE can obtain an annual safety certification upon the submission by September 14th of each year of certain required safety information, including an approved WMP. Under AB 1054, SCE is also required to submit a comprehensive WMP to the CPUC at least once every three years for review and approval. Each such comprehensive plan is now required to cover at least a three-year period. In addition, SCE anticipates updating its comprehensive three-year plans annually in the intervening years. SCE submitted its 2020 2022 WMP in February 2020 and most recently submitted updates to its plan in February 2022 to, among other things, report on implementation of its plan, describe new and ongoing wildfire mitigation activities and 
 157 

Table of Contents 
 report on its progress on remedying issues identified in an action statement issued by the OEIS in August 2021. In July 2022, the OEIS approved SCE s 2022 updates to its 2020 2022 WMP and the CPUC ratified the OEIS approval in August 2022. On December 13, 2022, SCE obtained a safety certification that will be valid for 12 months. Notwithstanding its 12-month term, if SCE requested a new safety certification by September 14, 2023, then its current safety certification would remain valid until OEIS acts on SCE s request for a new safety certification. SCE expects to file its 2023 2025 WMP in March 2023. Public Safety Power Shutoffs In addition to the investments SCE is making as part of its WMP, SCE also uses Public Safety Power Shutoffs PSPS to proactively de-energize power lines as a last resort to mitigate the risk of catastrophic wildfires during extreme weather events. SCE initiated PSPS 12 times in 2020 as part of its wildfire mitigation efforts resulting in an aggregate of approximately 268 million customer minutes interrupted. On a risk informed basis, SCE made efforts to reduce the frequency and impacts of PSPS in 2021 as compared to 2020. SCE initiated PSPS ten times in 2021 resulting in approximately 222 million customer minutes interrupted. The 2021 events include a January 2021 event that resulted in approximately 118 million customer minutes interrupted. While SCE s wildfire mitigation efforts contributed to the reduction in use and impact of PSPS in 2021, the use of PSPS also depends on weather and fuel conditions. SCE initiated PSPS six times in 2022 resulting in approximately seven million customer minutes interrupted. As of February 16, 2023, SCE had not initiated any PSPS events in 2023. In January 2021, the President of the CPUC sent SCE a letter expressing her concern regarding SCE s execution of PSPS in 2020 and notifying SCE that it must implement a PSPS action plan to reduce the impacts of PSPS on the customers and communities it serves. SCE has one item left to implement on its PSPS action plan. In June 2021, the CPUC issued a final decision which, among other things, will reduce future authorized revenue for the volumetric reductions in electricity sales resulting from PSPS events initiated after June 2021 until the CPUC determines that improvements in the PSPS program have been made. In June 2022, the SED issued an Administrative Enforcement Order AEO against SCE proposing penalties of 10 million for alleged noncompliance with customer notification requirements related to PSPS events in 2020. In October 2022, the SED and SCE reached a settlement agreement under which SCE agreed to pay 7 million and complete certain corrective actions to resolve the AEO. SCE did not admit wrongdoing or liability as part of the settlement. SCE s obligations under the settlement agreement will commence after CPUC approval of the agreement is final and non-appealable. SCE has made and continues to make significant investments and progress in improving its PSPS protocols, including through increased automation of customer notifications. ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS Greenhouse Gas Regulation Edison International recognizes that its industry and the global economy are in the midst of a profound transformation toward a low-carbon future as a response to climate change. SCE plans to be a key enabler of the adoption of new energy technologies that benefit customers of the electric grid. See Management Overview Electricity Industry Trends in the MD A. Approximately 66 of SCE s sources of utility-owned generation were carbon-free in 2022. SCE estimates that approximately 20 of power delivered to SCE s customers in 2022 came from SCE s own generating facilities, with approximately 9 nuclear, 3 large hydroelectric, less than 1 small hydroelectric, and less than 1 solar generation. Approximately 7 were natural gas sources. Since 2010, SCE has reported its annual GHG emissions from 
 158 

Table of Contents 
 utility-owned generation each year to the U.S Environmental Protection Agency by March 31 of the following year. SCE s 2022 GHG emissions from utility-owned generation are estimated to be approximately 1,500,000 metric tons. California is committed to reducing its GHG emissions, improving local air quality and supporting continued economic growth. California s major initiatives for reducing GHG emissions include a law that targets the reduction of GHG emissions across the entire state economy to 40 below 1990 levels by 2030 and a California cap-and-trade program established by the California Air Resources Board CARB ). Other major policy measures include the Low Carbon Fuel Standard program established by CARB. In 2022, the California Climate Crisis Act declared the policy of the state to achiev e net zero greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, but no later than 2045, to achieve and maintain net negative greenhouse gas emissions thereafter, and to ensure that by 2045, statewide anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are reduced to at least 85 below the 1990 levels. Edison International is committed to achieving net-zero GHG emissions by 2045, in alignment with economywide climate actions planned by California. This commitment covers the power SCE delivers to customers and Edison International s enterprise-wide operations. In the California cap-and-trade program, all covered GHG emitters, including SCE, are subject to an annually declining program cap on emissions designed to encourage entities to reduce emissions from their operations. Covered entities must remit a compliance instrument for each ton of carbon dioxide equivalent gas emitted and can do so buying state-issued emission allowances at auction or purchasing them in the secondary allowance market. From 2013 to 2020, GHG emitters could have met up to 8 of their cap-and-trade obligations by procuring GHG offset credits from verified offset programs, such as reforestation, that have recognized effects on reducing atmospheric GHGs. The offset usage limit has decreased to 4 for 2021 2025 emissions and will then increase to 6 for 2026 2030 emissions. Starting with 2021 emissions, no more than one-half of the quantitative offset usage limit may be sourced from projects that do not provide direct environmental benefits in California. California has adopted RPS targets that require California retail sellers of electricity to provide certain percentages of energy sales from renewable resources defined in the statute, including 33 of retail sales by December 2020; 44 of retail sales by December 2024, 52 of retail sales by December 2027, and 60 of retail sales by December 2030. Approximately 35 of SCE s supply portfolio in 2020 came from renewable sources eligible under California s RPS, of which 32 was delivered to customers and 3 was sold for resale. As such, SCE met California s 2020 RPS target. Approximately 39 of SCE s supply portfolio in 2022 came from renewable sources eligible under California s RPS, of which 36 was delivered to customers and 3 was sold for resale. SCE s climate change objectives align with California s requirements, and SCE remains well-positioned to meet California s 2030 and 2045 RPS targets. Separate from RPS targets, California requires the following percentages of retail sales of electricity to California end-use customers must be from carbon-free resources by the following deadlines: 90 by December 31, 2035, 95 by December 31, 2040, and 100 by December 31, 2045. California also requires each state agency to ensure that carbon free resources supply 100 of electricity procured on its behalf by December 31, 2035. SCE plans to propose for CPUC approval new programs to help state agency customers meet their accelerated 100 clear power needs. SCE estimates that approximately 48 of SCE s customer deliveries in 2022 came from carbon-free resources. SCE believes that it is well-positioned to meet California s carbon-free requirements. Additionally, the CPUC and the California Energy Commission adopted GHG emission performance standards that apply to California investor-owned and publicly owned utilities long-term arrangements for the purchase of electricity. The standards prohibit these entities, including SCE, from owning or entering into long-term financial commitments with generators, such as coal plants, that emit more GHG than a combined-cycle natural gas turbine generator. California also supports climate action to meet the December 2015 Paris Agreement.

 Edison International supports these California environmental initiatives and has undertaken analysis which, consistent with third-party analysis, shows that electrification across multiple sectors, including transportation and industrial sectors, is among the most cost-effective ways to achieve California s requirements and goals. Edison International and SCE believe that these initiatives will lead to increased electrification across the economy and SCE is investing in grid technologies and charging infrastructure to support California s goals. Environmental Risks Climate change has, and continues to, impact California. Southern California has warmed 3 degrees Fahrenheit in the last century, snowpack has declined, and the Western United States and Northern Mexico are experiencing their driest period in at least 1,200 years. Severe droughts and windstorms contributed to the devastating wildfires that swept through parts of California in recent years, demonstrating the serious threat that weather extremes caused by climate change pose to California s communities and the environment. See Management Overview Southern California Wildfires and Mudslides in the MD A and Business Southern California Wildfires. Severe weather events, including drought, increasingly severe windstorms and rising sea-levels, pose risks to SCE s infrastructure and SCE and Edison International are investing in building a more resilient grid to reduce climate- and weather-related vulnerabilities. See Liquidity and Capital Resources SCE Regulatory Proceedings Wildfire Related Regulatory Proceedings in the MD A. In May 2022, SCE provided its climate adaptability vulnerability assessment CAVA to the CPUC. The CAVA addresses the projected climate impacts of temperature, sea level, precipitation, wildfire, and cascading impacts (such as rain on snow or debris flow) on SCE in the 2030, 2050, and 2070 timeframes. SCE s CAVA will inform planning related to SCE assets, operations, and services, with the goal of maintaining a resilient electric grid in the face of climate change and will inform future investment in the grid. For more information on risks related to climate change, environmental regulation and SCE s business strategy, see Risk Factors Risks Relating to Southern California Edison Company Operating Risks. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. PROPERTIES As a holding company, Edison International does not directly own any significant properties other than the stock of its subsidiaries. The principal properties of SCE are described above under Business SCE Properties. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events Multiple lawsuits related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events naming SCE as a defendant have been filed by three categories of plaintiffs: individual plaintiffs, subrogation plaintiffs and public entity plaintiffs. A number of the lawsuits also name Edison International as a defendant and some of the lawsuits were filed as purported class actions. The litigation could take a number of years to be resolved because of the complexity of the matters and number of plaintiffs. As of February 16, 2023, SCE was aware of approximately 120 currently pending lawsuits, representing approximately 1,000 plaintiffs, related to the Thomas and Koenigstein Fires naming SCE as a defendant. Approximately 95 of the approximately 120 pending lawsuits also name Edison International as a defendant based on its ownership and alleged control of SCE. One of the lawsuits was filed as a purported class action. The lawsuits, which have been filed in the superior courts of Ventura, Santa Barbara and Los Angeles Counties allege, among other things, negligence, inverse

 condemnation, trespass, private nuisance, and violations of the public utilities and health and safety codes. SCE and certain of the individual plaintiffs in the Thomas and Koenigstein Fire litigation have been pursuing settlements of claims under a mediation program adopted to promote an efficient and orderly settlement process. Some individual plaintiffs have opted to pursue trial outside of the settlement program. Approximately 30 of the approximately 120 pending lawsuits mentioned in the paragraph above allege that SCE has responsibility for the Thomas and/or Koenigstein Fires and that the Thomas and/or Koenigstein Fires proximately caused the Montecito Mudslides, resulting in the plaintiffs claimed damages. Many of the Montecito Mudslides lawsuits also name Edison International as a defendant based on its ownership and alleged control of SCE. In addition to other causes of action, some of the Montecito Mudslides lawsuits also allege personal injury and wrongful death. A bellwether jury trial previously scheduled for October 12, 2020 was vacated due to the wide-spread disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of February 16, 2023, SCE was aware of approximately 370 currently pending lawsuits, representing approximately 3,000 plaintiffs, related to the Woolsey Fire naming SCE as a defendant. Approximately 110 of the 370 lawsuits also name Edison International as a defendant based on its ownership and alleged control of SCE. At least one of the lawsuits was filed as a purported class action. The lawsuits, which have been filed in the superior courts of Ventura and Los Angeles Counties allege, among other things, negligence, inverse condemnation, personal injury, wrongful death, trespass, private nuisance, and violations of the public utilities and health and safety codes. SCE and certain of the individual plaintiffs in the Woolsey Fire litigation have been pursuing settlements of claims under a mediation program adopted to promote an efficient and orderly settlement process. Some individual plaintiffs may opt to pursue trial outside of the settlement program. The Thomas and Koenigstein Fires and Montecito Mudslides lawsuits are being coordinated in the Los Angeles Superior Court. The Woolsey Fire lawsuits have also been coordinated in the Los Angeles Superior Court.

Commitments and Contingencies Contingencies Southern California Wildfires and Mudslides. Environmental Proceedings Each of Edison International and SCE have elected to disclose environmental proceedings described in Item 103(c)(3)(iii) of Regulation SK unless it reasonably believes that such proceeding will result in no monetary sanctions, or in monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, of less than 1,000,000. Mission Canyon SCE performed 1.6 miles of access road grading and vegetation clearing in the Mission Canyon area of Santa Barbara County in December 2019, resulting in debris moving downslope into a creek bed and other impacts in the area (the Mission Canyon Incident ). Several state and federal environmental agencies and the County and City of Santa Barbara have investigated the unpermitted grading and discharges to the creek, and SCE has received Notices of Violation from the Army Corps of Engineers, the County of Santa Barbara, the California Department of Fish Wildlife and the Regional Water Quality Control Board. In December 2020, SCE and the Santa Barbara County District Attorney entered into a settlement regarding alleged criminal and civil violations related to the Mission Canyon Incident. Under the settlement, SCE pled no contest to a single misdemeanor charge for violation of the California Water Code and agreed to pay a 10,000 fine. SCE also agreed to pay a civil penalty of 3.5 million and is subject to an injunction compelling it to complete planned remediation work related to the Mission Canyon Incident and not commit similar violations for five years. It is presently unknown whether any regulatory agencies will impose additional fines or penalties on SCE with respect to the Mission Canyon Incident and, if so, in what amounts. SCE does not expect fines or penalties that are

 balancing the design of an audit scope that will achieve a high-quality audit with driving efficiencies from both SCE and PwC while compensating PwC fairly. The SCE Audit and Finance Committee is required to pre-approve all audit and permitted non-audit services performed by PwC to ensure these services will not impair the firm s independence. The SCE Audit and Finance Committee has delegated to the Committee Chair the authority to pre-approve services between committee meetings, provided that any pre-approval decisions are presented to the committee at its next meeting. PwC must assure that all audit and non-audit services provided to SCE have been approved by the SCE Audit and Finance Committee. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, all services performed by PwC were pre-approved by the SCE Audit and Finance Committee, irrespective of whether the services required pre-approval under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

 billion, million and billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Dividend Restrictions CPUC holding company rules require that SCE s dividend policy be established by SCE s Board of Directors on the same basis as if SCE were a stand-alone utility company, and that the capital requirements of SCE, as deemed to be necessary to meet SCE s electricity service obligations, shall receive first priority from the Boards of Directors of both Edison International and SCE. In addition, the CPUC regulates SCE s capital structure which limits the dividends it may pay to its shareholders. The common equity component of SCE s CPUC authorized capital structure is on a weighted average basis over the January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2025 compliance period. This is unchanged from the January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022 compliance period. The CPUC authorized capital structure differs from the capital structure calculated based on GAAP due to certain exclusions allowed by CPUC, including the impact of SCE s contributions to the Wildfire Insurance Fund under AB 1054. For further information, see Business SCE Overview of Ratemaking Process and Business Southern California Wildfires. In May 2020, the CPUC issued a decision on SCE s application to the CPUC for waiver of compliance with its equity ratio requirement, that allows SCE to exclude from its equity ratio calculations (i) net charges accrued in connection with the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events and (ii) debt issued for the purpose of paying claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events up to an amount equal to the net charges accrued in connection with the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. With these exclusions, SCE was in compliance with its authorized capital structure for the compliance period from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022. The temporary exclusion lapsed on May 7, 2022. In April 2022, SCE filed another application requesting continued waiver of compliance with its equity ratio requirement. Under the CPUC s rules, SCE will not be deemed to be in violation of the equity ratio requirement while the waiver application is pending resolution. While the exclusion is in place, SCE is required to notify the CPUC if an adverse financial event reduces SCE s spot equity ratio by more than one percent from the level most recently filed with the CPUC in the proceeding. The last spot equity ratio SCE filed with the CPUC in the proceeding did not exclude the then billion net charge and was as of December 31, 2018 (at the time the common equity component of SCE s CPUC authorized capital structure was required to remain at or above on a weighted average basis over the applicable period). SCE s spot equity ratio on December 31, 2018 would have been had the billion net charge at December 31, 2018 been excluded, therefore SCE will notify the CPUC if its spot ratio drops below in any quarter.
