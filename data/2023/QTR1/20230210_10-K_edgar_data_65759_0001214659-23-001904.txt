light emitting and light sensitive materials and products, including light-emitting diodes and silicon phototransistors, and electronic
integration used in the Company s optoelectronic components and assemblies. 

The business of the Company was started in 1963
as a sole proprietorship. On March 3, 1969, the Company was incorporated under the name of Micropac Industries, Inc. in
the state of Delaware. The stock was publicly held by 435 shareholders on November 30, 2022. 

PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES 

The Company s products are either custom
(being application-specific circuits designed and manufactured to meet the particular requirements of a single customer) or standard proprietary
components. Custom-designed components and assemblies accounted for approximately 29 of the Company s sales for the fiscal year
ended November 30, 2022 and were 30 for fiscal 2021. Standard components and assemblies accounted for approximately 71 of the Company s
sales for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2022 and were 70 for fiscal 2021. 

The Company provides microelectronics, sensors
and displays, and optoelectronics products, to include components and assemblies that offer a wide range of products sold to the industrial,
medical, military, aerospace and space markets. 

The microelectronic technologies, including custom
microcircuits, solid state relays, power operational amplifiers, and regulators accounted for 29 of the Company s business in 2022
compared to 29 in 2021. Sensors and displays accounted for 43 of the Company s business and the optocouplers product accounted
for 28 of the Company s business in 2022, compared to 45 and 26 in 2021, respectively. 

The Company s basic products and technologies
include: 

Custom design hybrid microelectronic circuits

expires on July 10, 2031. On January 6, 2018, the Company received its patent for the Voltage bus protection and isolation devices ,
which expires on January 5, 2032. 

The Company has no licenses, franchises, or labor
contracts. The Company s has two trademarks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. 

Sales of our products internationally are subject
to government regulations, including export control regulations of the U.S. Department of State and Department of Commerce. Violation
of these regulations by the Company could result in monetary penalties and denial of export privileges. The Company is not aware of any
violations of export control regulations or similar applicable government regulations. 

Five of the Company s principal product
families require government approval. Further, a significant portion of our business is military and is dependent on maintaining our facility
certifications to MIL-PRF-38534 and MIL-PRF-19500. In addition, several customers require the Company maintain AS 9100 certifications.
We expect to maintain these certifications and qualifications; however, the loss of any of these certifications would have a significant
negative impact on our business. 

Government regulations impose certain controls
on chemicals used in electronics and semiconductor manufacturing. Micropac has obtained appropriate environmental permits, and routinely
monitors and reports the wastewater stream results to the local governing agency. Micropac is classified as a small generator of hazardous
waste, and the annual cost of complying with the regulations is minimal. 

In 2022, the Company s investment in technology
through research and development, which was expensed, totaled approximately 2,191,000 1,739,000 in 2021). The Company s research
and development expenditures were directed primarily toward standard proprietary microelectronic products, including industrial power
controllers and DC-DC converters, fiber optic transceivers, high voltage optocouplers and continued product development and improvement
associated with the Company s space level and other high reliability products. 

In addition to the Company s investment
in research and development, various customers paid the Company approximately 1,620,000 in non-recurring engineering revenue with 1,348,000
recorded within cost of goods sold associated with the development of custom products for specific applications. 

The Company provides a one-year warranty from
the date of shipment to the original purchaser. The Company is obligated under this warranty to either replace or repair defective goods
or refund the purchase price paid by the buyer. 

CUSTOMERS 

The Company s products are marketed throughout
the United States and in Western Europe, through a direct technical sales staff, independent representatives, and independent stocking
distributors. Approximately 4 of the sales for fiscal year 2022 (4 in 2021) were to international customers. Sales to Western European
customers are made by independent representatives under the coordination of the Company s office in Bremen, Germany. 

Sales through the Company s distribution
channels were 10,330,000 in 2022 compared to 9,449,000 in 2021, or 37 and 35 of sales, respectively. 

The Company s major customers include contractors
to the United States government. Sales to these customers for the Department of Defense (DOD) and NASA contracts accounted for approximately
77 of the Company s revenues in 2022 compared to 67 in 2021. 

The Company s major customers are Lockheed
Martin, Northrop Grumman, United Technologies, BAE, and Boeing. Two customers accounted for 18 and 10 of the Company s sales during

HUMAN CAPITAL 

Micropac Industries,
Inc., is committed to attracting and retaining the brightest and best talent. Therefore, investing, developing, and maintaining human
capital is critical to our success. 

We are committed to advancing
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE I) across the entire Company and the future success of the Company is our ability to attract
and retain a diverse workforce. DE I are and have long been, critical to our culture and our Company s success and our performance
depends on attracting, developing, motivating, and retaining a highly skilled workforce, including engineering, manufacturing, business
development and strategy and management. 

At November 30, 2022, the Company had 147 full-time
employees (compared to 153 at November 30, 2021), of which 14 were executive and managerial employees, 37 were engineers and quality-control
personnel, 17 were clerical and administrative employees, and 79 were production personnel. None of the Company s employees
are covered by collective bargaining agreements. 

The Company
is an equal opportunity employer. It is the Company s policy to recruit, hire, train and promote personnel in all job classifications,
without regard to race, religion, color, national origin, sex or age. Above and beyond non-discrimination, we are committed to an
Affirmative Action Program, dedicated to the hiring, training, and advancement within the Company of minority group members, women, veterans,
and handicapped individuals. 

Our values
are also integral to our commitment to long-term sustainability, with environmental, social and governance (ESG) across our Company. With
the construction of our new manufacturing center, discussed below, the Company has included in the design and construction significant
improvements in support of our commitment to ESG. 

COMPETITION 

The Company competes with two or more companies
with respect to each of its major products. Some of these competitors are larger and have greater capital resources than the Company.
Management believes the Company s competitive position is favorable with regard to our product reliability and integrity, past performance,
customer service and responsiveness, timely delivery and pricing; however, no assurance can be given that the Company can compete successfully
in the future. 

5 

There are approximately 35 independent manufacturing
companies who are certified to supply microcircuits to MIL-PRF-38534 or supply semiconductors to MIL-PRF-19500, in addition to OEM s,
who manufacture hybrid microcircuits for their internal needs. Micropac may compete with all of these for hybrid microcircuit, power management
and optoelectronics business. Some of the Company s primary competitors are TTM Technologies, Cobham Advanced Electronic Solutions,
TT Electronics, and Infineon Technologies. 

SUPPLY CHAIN 

The parts and raw materials for the Company s
products are generally available from more than one source. Except for certain optoelectronic products, the Company does not manufacture
the basic parts or materials used in production of its products. From time to time, the Company has experienced difficulty in obtaining
certain materials when needed. The Company s inability to secure materials for any reason could have adverse effects on the Company s
ability to deliver products on a timely basis and could result in loss of customers or sales. However, the Company has not been materially
affected by such shortages. The Company uses capacitors, active semiconductor devices (primarily in chip form), hermetic packages, ceramic
substrates, resistor inks, conductor pastes, precious metals and other materials in its manufacturing operations. The Company s
delivery commitments to customers allow for adequate lead times for production of the products including lead time for order and receipt
from the supply chain. 

Some of the Company s primary suppliers
are NTK Technologies, W. L Gore, Hughes Circuits, Semi-Dice and TTI. 

Item 1A. Material Risk Factors 

This annual report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking
statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results
could differ materially. Investors are warned that forward-looking statements involve risks and unknown factors including, but not limited
to: our expectations regarding the potential impacts on our operations of the COVID-19 pandemic; our expectations regarding the potential
impacts on our supply chain and on our customers of the COVID-19 pandemic; overall changes in governmental spending for military and space
programs; customer cancellation or rescheduling of orders, problems affecting delivery of vendor-supplied raw materials and components,
unanticipated manufacturing problems and availability of direct labor resources. 

The Company disclaims any responsibility to update
the forward-looking statements contained herein, except as may be required by law. 

Concentration Related Risk Factors 

The Company is heavily dependent on a few major
customers 

The Company s major customers include contractors
to the United States government. Sales to these customers for DOD and NASA contracts accounted for approximately 77 of the Company s
revenues in 2022 compared to 67 in 2021. The Company s major customers are Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, United Technologies,
BAE, and Boeing. Two customers accounted for 18 and 10 of the Company s sales during 2022 and one customer accounted for 20 during
2021. The contracts of our customers with the United States government may be subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts
or subcontracts at the election of the government, which would in turn might materially affect the Company s sales. The loss of
any one of these customers or a significant reduction in their purchases would be likely to adversely affect our business. 

In addition, the Company has several custom commercial
and medical products with a current backlog of 5,321,000. The loss of these custom products or a significant reduction in their purchases
would be likely to adversely affect our business. 

Financing Related Risk Factors 

We experience pricing pressures from customers
for reduction in selling prices 

The Company continues to experience pricing pressures
from some of its OEM customers. In some cases, the Company s customers request the review of pricing for possible reduction in selling
price on future orders. This requires the Company to improve its productivity and to request similar price reductions from its supplier
chain. If one or both of the approaches by the Company does not succeed, the Company could be required to reduce the selling price on
future orders, reducing the product gross margins and affecting the Company s net earnings in order to receive future orders from
the customer. However, the Company has no agreement that requires a reduction in the selling price on any current customer order. All
contracts are firm fixed pricing. 

6 

The Company has potential warranty obligations 

The Company provides a one-year warranty from
the date of shipment to the original purchaser. The Company is obligated under this warranty to either replace or repair defective goods
or refund the purchase price paid by the buyer. An unexpected number of warranty claims could negatively impact the profitability of the
Company. 

Inflation and rising costs 

The cost to manufacture the Company s products
is influenced by the cost of raw materials and labor. The Company has recently experienced higher costs with increasing cost of labor
and cost of raw materials with inflation. The Company may, from time to time, offset these cost increases by increasing the prices of
its products on new contracts. 

Operations Related Risk Factors 

Fabrication efforts may not be successful 

The Company produces silicon phototransistors
and light-emitting diode die for use in certain military, standard and custom products. Fabrication efforts sometimes may not result in
successful results, limiting the availability of these components. Competitors offer commercial level alternatives, and our customers
may purchase our competitors products if the Company is not able to manufacture the products using these technologies to meet the
customer demands. 

Component shortages from suppliers could affect
ability to manufacture products or delay shipments to customers 

The Company relies on suppliers to deliver quality
raw materials in a timely and cost-effective manner. Most of the materials and components are generally available from multiple sources;
however, from time-to-time vendors do not deliver the product as needed due to manufacturing problems or a decision to discontinue that
product. Such interruption of supply or price increases could have a material adverse effect on the Company s operations; however,
the Company is not currently impacted by material shortages. 

We must maintain the ability to enhance our
products and develop new products for the military, space or aerospace markets 

The Company s base products and technologies
generally have long life cycles. The Company s products are primarily used in military, space or aerospace applications, which also
have long life cycles. Our future success may, however, depend in part on our ability to enhance the functionality of our existing products
in a timely and cost-effective manner, our ability to continue close working relationships with major customers for the design of their
new products, and our ability to develop new products and technologies for existing and emerging markets. We must also continue to make
significant investments in research and development efforts in order to meet customer specifications for specially fabricated products.
We may not be able to retain or obtain engineers, or other technical support staff, to conduct our research and development efforts as
needed. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to design, develop and market new products and technologies on a timely
and cost-effective basis. Failure to respond to our customers requirements and to our competitors progress in technological
changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business. 

Regulatory Related Risk Factors 

We are significantly affected by government
policy 

The Company could be adversely affected by changes
in laws and regulations made by U.S. and non-U.S. governments and agencies dealing with foreign shipments. Changes in trade agreements
or taxes on imports or exports could adversely affect our operations or financial condition. 

Sales of our products internationally are subject
to government regulations, including export control regulations of the U.S. Department of State and Department of Commerce. Changes in
these regulations could adversely affect our business. Violation of these regulations by the Company could result in monetary penalties
and denial of export privileges. 

The Company is subject to the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials
for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Any violation of the FCPA or similar laws and regulations could result in significant
expenses, divert management attention, have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial condition and our results of operations
and otherwise have a negative impact on the Company and its reputation. 

7 

Reductions or changes in U.S. government spending 

The loss or significant reduction of a U.S. government
or NASA program in which our major customers participate could adversely affect our business. U.S. government contracts generally are
conditioned on the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds for on-going programs
on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may extend over many years. At the beginning of a major program, the contract
is often only partially funded, and additional monies are committed only as Congress makes appropriations in future fiscal years. In addition,
most U.S. government contracts are subject to modification if funding is changed. Key programs in which our customers participate must
compete with other programs for consideration during the federal budgeting and appropriation process, and support and funding for any
U.S. government program may be influenced by general economic conditions, political considerations, and other factors. A decline in support
and funding for programs in which our customers participate could result in contract terminations, delays in contract awards, failure
to extend contracts, cancellation of planned procurements and fewer new business opportunities for our customers. Our business may be
adversely affected as a result of changes or reductions in U.S. government or NASA spending. 

Market Related Risk Factors 

Majority shareholder ability to control the
election of the Board of Directors 

The Company s majority shareholder, Mr.
Heinz-Werner Hempel, established a partnership organized under the laws of Germany, which owns 1,952,577 shares or 75.7 of the outstanding
voting shares. Mr. Hempel, through the partnership, has the ability to control the election of the Company s Board of Directors
and elect individuals who may be more attuned to such majority shareholder s vision for the Company and not necessarily to those
of minority shareholders as to the policies and directions of the Company. However, the ability to control the election of the Board of
Directors does not modify the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors to represent the interests of all shareholders. 

There are limited shares for purchase and sale 

A small number of shares are available for public
purchase and sale. The Company s reported share price may be subject to extreme fluctuations, or one or a few trades may determine
the reported market price, due in part to the small number of shares traded at any time. 

General Risk Factors 

Impact of COVID-19 on our Business 

In March 2020 the World Health Organization declared
the spread of the COVID-19 virus a pandemic. The Company continues to monitor our supply chain and orders from customers for COVID-19
pandemic related changes. We are continuing to serve our customers while taking precautions to provide a safe work environment for our
employees and customers. We have been staggering some shifts and otherwise adjusting work schedules to maximize our capacity while adhering
to recommended precautions. We have established and implemented a work from home provision where possible. 

To date, we have not experienced significant raw
material shortages; however, supply-chain disruptions could potentially delay or prevent us from fulfilling customer orders. 

We are subject to cybersecurity risks 

Cybersecurity risks and attacks continue to grow.
Cybersecurity attacks are evolving and not always predictable. Attacks include malicious software, threats to information technology infrastructure,
denial-of-service attacks on websites, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, ransomware attacks, and other breaches. Data breaches
can originate with authorized or unauthorized persons. Authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or
proprietary information, and recipients could misuse data. Such events could lead to interruption of our operations or business, unauthorized
release or use of information, compromise of data, damage to our reputation, damage to our customers or vendors, and increased costs to
prevent, respond to or mitigate any events.

Insurance coverage and exposure to substantial
claims or liabilities 

The Company operates manufacturing facilities
in Garland, Texas and subcontracts portions of the Company s manufacturing to a contract manufacturer in Juarez, Mexico. These facilities
use industrial machines and chemicals that could provide risks of personal injury and/or property damage. There is no assurance that accidents
will not occur. If accidents do occur, the Company could be exposed to substantial liability. The Company maintains worker s compensation
insurance and general liability insurance for protection of its employees and for protection of the Company s assets in Garland,
Texas and for equipment and inventory located at the contract manufacturer in Juarez, Mexico. In addition to the basic policies mentioned,
the Company maintains an umbrella insurance policy. The Company reviews all insurance coverage on an annual basis, and makes any necessary
adjustments based on risk assessment and changes in its business. In the opinion of the Company s management, and its insurance
advisors, the Company is adequately insured; however, the Company s financial position could be materially affected by claims not
covered or exceeding coverage currently carried by the Company. 

Environmental regulations 

The Company is subject to increasingly stringent
environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges, chemical and hazardous waste management
and disposal. Some of these environmental laws hold owners or operators of land or businesses liable for their own and for previous owners 
or operators releases of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Other environmental laws and regulations require that we obtain
and comply with environmental permits. To date, costs of complying with environmental requirements have not been material. Future events,
including those relating to climate change or greenhouse gas emissions, could require the Company to incur expenses related to installation
of pollution control equipment, or investigation and cleanup of contaminated sites. If the Company fails to comply with environmental
laws and regulations, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities or be required to curtail or cease its manufacturing activities.
Changes in environmental laws or regulations could affect the cost of the Company s products and make it hard for the Company to
be competitive with larger companies. 

We may default on its line of credit or construction
loan 

The Company currently has an existing line of
credit and a construction loan with a Texas banking institution. In connection therewith, the Company is obligated to maintain certain
minimum financial requirements in order to receive advances therefrom. The Company is currently in compliance with such financial requirements,
but there is no guarantee that the Company will remain in compliance. If the Company does not maintain compliance with each of the requirements,
its ability to receive advances from the line of credit or construction loan will be impaired. 

We may incur product liability claims 

The use of the Company s products in commercial
or government applications may subject the Company to product liability claims. Although the Company has not experienced any significant
product liability claims, the risk of such claims continues. Product liability claims brought against the Company could have a material
adverse effect on the Company s operating results and financial condition. 

Our products may have errors or defects that
we find only after deployment 

Our products are complex, designed to be incorporated
in sophisticated applications, and may contain undetected defects, errors, or failures. Although our products are generally tested during
manufacturing, prior to shipping, they may contain defects that are discovered only after the products are incorporated in customer applications.
The occurrence of any defects, errors, or failures could result in installation delays, product returns, termination of contracts with
our customers, diversion of our resources, increased service and warranty costs, and other losses to our customers, their end users, or
to us. Any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of customers, and could damage our reputation, which could reduce our sales.
In addition to the risk of unanticipated warranty or recall expenses, our customer contracts may contain provisions that could cause us
to incur penalties, be liable for damages, or incur other expenses, if we experience difficulties with respect to the functionality, deployment,
operation, and availability of our products and services.

employees and customers. We have been staggering some shifts and otherwise adjusting work schedules to maximize our capacity while adhering
to recommended precautions. We have established and implemented a work from home provision where possible. 

To date, we have not experienced significant raw
material shortages; however, supply-chain disruptions could potentially delay or prevent us from fulfilling customer orders. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company obtained
a commercial real estate construction loan for the construction of a new 76,000 square foot manufacturing center on the 9.2 acres of land
in Garland, Texas that the Company has purchased. On March 26, 2021, the Company (acting as borrower) entered into a Construction Loan
Agreement (the loan agreement with Frost Bank Frost (acting as lender). The Construction Loan Agreement
provides for a construction loan, in amounts not to exceed a total principal balance of 16,160,000 with an interest rate of (3.40 per
annum. 

On March 26, 2021, the
Company renewed the Revolving Loan Agreement with Frost through the Sixth Amendment to Loan Agreement. (See Exhibit 10.13).
The Revolving Loan Agreement provides for revolving credit loans, in amounts not to exceed a total principal balance of 6,000,000 with
a rate equal to prime rate with a floor of 3.25 . The Revolving Loan Agreement was originally entered into on January 23, 2013, between
the Company as borrower and Frost as lender. 

Construction Loans . Subject
to the terms of the Loan Agreement, Frost will lend to the Company an aggregate amount not to exceed 16,160,000. 

Principal and interest
shall be due and payable monthly in an amounts determined by Lender required to fully amortize the outstanding principal balance of this
Note over a period of twenty-five (25) years, payable on the twenty-sixth (26th) day of each and every calendar month, beginning April
26, 2023, and continuing regularly thereafter until March 26, 2031, when the entire amount hereof, principal and accrued interest then
remaining unpaid, shall be then due and payable; interest being calculated on the unpaid principal each day principal is outstanding and
all payments made credited to any collection costs and late charges, to the discharge of the interest accrued and to the reduction of

The Company has no significant off-balance sheet
arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation
of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We base our
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Note 2 to the Financial Statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2022 ,
describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. liabilities. Actual results
could differ from these estimates. 

The core principle of revenue recognition under
accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America (GAAP) is that the Company should recognize 
revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company s revenue on the majority of its customer contracts
are recognized at a point in time, generally upon shipment of products. The application of GAAP related to the measurement and recognition
of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Specifically, the determination of whether revenues related to our revenue contracts
should be recognized over time or at a point in time, as these determinations impact the timing and amount of our reported revenues and
net income. Other significant judgments include the estimation of the point in the manufacturing process at which we are entitled to receive
payment, as well as the progress of the job order to completion to determine the amount of consideration earned for contractual revenue
recognized over time. 

The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on
our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable. If there is a deterioration
of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, our estimates of the recoverability
of amounts due us could be adversely affected. 

Inventory purchases and commitments are based
upon future demand. If there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence
because of changing customer requirements, we may be required to increase our inventory allowances and our gross margin could be adversely
affected. 

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and
liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and
laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered. If we were to determine we would not be able
to realize all or part of the deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be necessary which would
reduce our net income for that period. 

14 

Depreciable and useful lives estimated for property
and equipment are based on initial expectations of the period of time these assets will provide benefit. Changes in circumstances related
to a change in our business or other factors could result in these assets becoming impaired, which could adversely affect the value of
these assets. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial
Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , which changes the impairment
model for most financial assets. The ASU requires the use of an expected loss model for instruments measured at amortized
cost, in which companies will be required to estimate the lifetime expected credit loss and record an allowance to offset the amortized
cost basis, resulting in a net presentation of the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The new guidance is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 for Smaller Reporting Companies, including interim periods within those fiscal years
and requires a modified-retrospective approach to adoption. The Company believes that adopting ASU 2016-13 will have no material impact
on the financial statements and related disclosures.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 

 Micropac Industries, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited
the accompanying balance sheets of Micropac Industries, Inc. (the Company as of November 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related
statements of income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of November 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years
then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are
a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is
a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the
audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and 
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter
in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,
providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates.

Critical Audit Matter Description 

As disclosed in Note 2 to the financial statements,
the Company produces certain products with no alternative use and for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment during the
production cycle. For these contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time as control over these products transfers to the customer.
Thus, the Company records contract assets for work in process contracts at the end of each reporting period. The Company uses costs incurred
to date as the method for determining progress, and revenue is recognized based on costs incurred to date plus an estimate of margin at
completion. The process of estimating final margin involves estimating the costs to complete production of goods and comparing those costs
to the total transaction price. These contracts are inherently uncertain in that revenue is fixed while the estimates of costs required
to complete these contracts are subject to variability. Due to the technical performance requirements in many of these contracts, changes
to cost estimates could occur, resulting in higher or lower margins when the contracts are completed. 

We identified revenue associated with work in
process contracts recognized over time as a critical audit matter. The process of estimating final margin is subjective in nature that
and resulted in a higher degree of audit effort and judgment. Changes in estimates of final margin could have a significant impact on
the timing of revenue recognition. 

How We Addressed the Matter 

We obtained an understanding of the design of
internal controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to recording revenue from contracts with customers where revenue
is recognized over time. We evaluated the reasonableness of judgements made and assumptions used by management relating to key estimates
which include estimated total costs to complete and estimated final margins. We reviewed executed contracts to understand the contract
terms, reperformed management s process of assigning the appropriate timing of revenue recognition and tested the mathematical accuracy
of revenue recognized over time based on costs incurred to date relative to total estimated margin. We tested the accuracy and completeness
of the data used in developing key estimates, including materials, labor, and overhead costs. We performed a review of audit evidence
from transactions completed after the measurement date related to the final gross margins for comparison to the Company s initial
gross margin estimates. 

We evaluated management s ability to estimate
total inputs accurately by comparing actual inputs to management s historical estimates for contracts that have been fulfilled.

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 NOVEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2021 

For certain contracts under which the
Company produces products with no alternative use and for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment during the production
cycle, the Company recognizes revenue for the cost incurred of work in process plus a margin at the end of each period and records a contract
asset (unbilled receivable). The majority of these products are shipped weekly and monthly to the customers and the contracts require
us to manage and limit the level of work in process to meet the scheduled delivery dates. 

In addition, the Company may have a
contract or purchase order to provide a non-recurring engineering service to a customer. These contracts are reviewed, and performance
obligations are determined and we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied.

The Company assesses long-lived assets for impairment
in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) ASC 360-10-35, Property, Plant
and Equipment Subsequent Measurement . When events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired, an assessment is
performed. The estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset s net book value to
determine if a write down to market value less cost to sell is required. 

Construction in progress relates to multiple capital
projects ongoing during the years ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, including the construction of the new manufacturing facility. Construction

Leases 

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) . Under the new standard, lessees will be required to recognize lease assets and liabilities
for all leases, with certain exceptions, on their balance sheets. Public business entities are required to adopt the standard for reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Upon transition to the new standard, the Company elected the package of practical expedients,
which permitted the Company not to reassess under the new standard its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification
and initial direct costs. 

In the first quarter of 2020, the Company entered
into a three (3) year lease extension on the property that has been leased on a year to year basis. As a result, we recognized 
for operating lease liabilities and right of use assets upon adoption of ASC 842. The Company had an operating lease expense of 
for 2022. The Company used an estimated incremental borrowing rate of representative of the rate of interest that the Company would
have to pay to borrow on the Company s line of credit. The remaining lease term is three months. 

The undiscounted future minimum lease payments consist of the following

vested in Company contributions in increments in years two through six of employment. If the employee leaves the Company prior to
being fully vested, the unvested portion of the Company contributions are forfeited and such forfeitures are used to lower future Company
contributions. The Company does not offer other post-retirement benefits to its employees at this time.

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax
assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which
those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets, projected future
taxable income, and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections
for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than
not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences.

Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management and has discussed such financial statements with
the independent auditors. 

The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures
and the report from the independent accountant required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) regarding the independent accountant s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed
with the independent accountants the independent accountant s independence. Based upon the review and discussions referred to above,
the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company s annual
report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2022, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Management has the responsibility
for the preparation and integrity of the Company's financial statements and the independent registered public accounting firm have the
responsibility for the audit of those statements. It is not the duty of the Audit Committee to conduct audits to determine that the Company s
financial statements are complete and accurate and are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
In giving its recommendations, the Audit Committee considered (a) management's representation that such financial statements have been
prepared with integrity and objectivity and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
and (b) the report of the Company s independent auditors with respect to such financial 

 statements. 

Nominating, Compensation
and Corporate Governance 

The Board of Directors does not have a nominating,
compensation committee or corporate governance committee or committees performing similar functions. 

The Directors of the Company are responsible for
developing and recommending corporate governance guidelines, identifying qualified individuals to become directors, recommending selected
nominees to serve on the Board, and overseeing the evaluation of the Board. 

In addition, the independent Directors are responsible
for considering and recommending the compensation arrangements for senior management. As part of its other responsibilities, they provide
general oversight of our compensation structure, and, if deemed, necessary, retains and approves compensation consultants and other compensation
experts. Other specific duties and responsibilities of reviewing the performance of executive officers; reviewing and approving objectives
relevant to executive officer compensation; recommending incentive compensation plans; and recommending compensation policies and practices
for service on our Board of Directors. 

Board Leadership Structure 

Our Board of Directors does
not have a policy on whether the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors should be separate and, if they
are to be separate, whether the Chairman of the Board should be selected from the non-employee directors or be an employee. Our Board
of Directors believes that it should be free to make a choice from time to time in any manner that is in the best interest of us and our
stockholders. 

The Board of Directors believes that Mr. King s
service as both Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board is in the best interest of us and our stockholders. Mr. King possesses
detailed and in-depth knowledge of the issues, opportunities and challenges we face and is thus best positioned to develop agendas, to
ensure that the Board s time and attention are focused on the most critical matters. His combined role enables decisive leadership,
ensures clear accountability, and enhances our ability to communicate our message and strategy clearly and consistently to our stockholders,
employees, and customers and suppliers. 

 Our Board of Directors believes that the independent
directors provide effective oversight of management. 

32 

Board of Directors Role in the Oversight
of Risk Management 

The Board of Directors has designated the Audit
Committee to take the lead in overseeing risk management at the Board of Directors level. Accordingly, the Audit Committee schedules time
for periodic review of risk management, in addition to its other duties. In this role, the Audit Committee receives reports from management,
independent registered public accounting firm, outside legal counsel, and other advisors, and strives to generate serious and thoughtful
attention to our risk management process and system, the nature of the material risks we face, and the adequacy of our policies and procedures
designed to respond to and mitigate these risks. 

In addition to the formal compliance program,
our Board of Directors encourage management to promote a corporate culture that understands risk management and incorporates it into our
overall corporate strategy and day-to-day business operations.

PROPOSAL 2- ADVISORY
VOTE ON COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVES 

As required pursuant
to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), we are asking stockholders to approve the compensation paid to the
company s named executives, Messrs. King and Cefalu, as disclosed in this proxy statement on pages 6 to 7, in an advisory vote.
In the annual meeting held in March 2014, our shareholders approved a proposal to hold the advisory vote on executive compensation every
three years. The last advisory vote on executive compensation was taken in connection with the annual meeting in March 2017, at which
time our executive compensation was approved. 

This advisory proposal,
commonly referred to as a say-on-pay proposal, is not binding on the Board of Directors. Although the voting results are
not binding, the Board will review and consider them when evaluating our executive compensation program. 

The Board recommends
a vote FOR this proposal because it believes that our compensation policies and practices are effective in achieving the Company s
goals. 

34 

PROPOSAL 3 - ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY
OF 

 FUTURE ADVISORY VOTES ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 

In Proposal Number 2
above, we are asking stockholders to vote on an advisory resolution on executive compensation. As required pursuant to Section 14A
of the Exchange Act, in this Proposal Number 3, we are asking stockholders to vote on whether future advisory votes on executive compensation
should occur every year, every two years or every three years. Stockholders will be able to specify one of four choices for this proposal
on the proxy card: one year, two years, three years, or abstain. This vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation
is non-binding on the Board, although the Board will review and consider the results of this vote when establishing the timing for future
advisory votes such as the one in Proposal Number 2. 

This is the second such
advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on the compensation we pay our executives. We intend to hold advisory votes on
the frequency of the say-on-pay advisory votes every six years, as required under the Exchange Act. We believe, given the
levels of compensation provided our executives and the lack of any current stock option plan or other incentive compensation other than
a bonus, that an advisory vote every six years on the frequency of the say-on-pay advisory vote is sufficient. 

 The Board of Directors
recommends that stockholders vote for holding the advisory vote on executive compensation EVERY THREE YEARS. 

PROPOSAL 4 - THE ADOPTION OF THE MICROPAC INDUSTRIES, INC. 2023
EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN 

On February 8, 2023, the Board of Directors of Micropac has approved

The complete text of the Plan is attached as Exhibit A to this Proxy
Statement. 

If approved by the shareholders, the Plan will be effective December
1, 2022. The Management of the Company believes that the Plan will promote the best interest of Micropac by: 

(1) encourage continuity of management, 

 (2) increase personal interest in Micropac s welfare

growth and financial success; and 

 (3) help in attracting and retaining key personnel of outstanding

goals.
