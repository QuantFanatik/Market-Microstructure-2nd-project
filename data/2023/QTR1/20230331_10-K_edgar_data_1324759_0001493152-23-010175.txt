LOOKING STATEMENTS

statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regarding
events, conditions, and financial trends that may affect the Company s future plans of operations, business strategy, operating
results, and financial position. Persons reviewing this report are cautioned that any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of
future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties and that actual results may differ materially from those included within
the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. 

Statements
made in this Form 10-K that are not historical or current facts are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe
harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date
made. Any forward-looking statements represent our best judgment as to what may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements
include our plans and objectives for our future growth, including plans and objectives related to the consummation of acquisitions and
future private and public issuances of our equity and debt securities. The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current

among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible
to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking
statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking

PART

Item
 1 
 Business. 

Our
Company 

Hong
Yuan Holding Group, formerly Cereplast, Inc., a Nevada corporation Hong Yuan , the Company, we , us 
or our is a public shell company seeking to create value for its shareholders by merging with another entity with experienced
management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock. 

The
Company is planning potential acquisitions. The management has approached several companies in China and met the management of potential
acquisition targets. The Company feels strongly that despite the challenges of cross border business, it might be able to acquire some
good growth companies and bring good values to our stockholders. Although the Company is making some progress in the Merger and Acquisition
efforts, any potential results, if any, are still not certain. 

We
do not propose to restrict our search for a business opportunity to any particular industry or geographical area and may, therefore,
engage in essentially any business in any industry. We have unrestricted discretion in seeking and participating in a business opportunity,
subject to the availability of such opportunities, economic conditions, and other factors. 

The
selection of a business opportunity in which to participate is complex and risky. Additionally, we have only limited resources and may
find it difficult to locate good opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire any business opportunity
which will ultimately prove to be beneficial to us and our shareholders. We will select any potential business opportunity based on our
management s best business judgment. 

Our
activities are subject to several significant risks, which arise primarily as a result of the fact that we have no specific business,
and may acquire or participate in a business opportunity based on the decision of management, which potentially could act without the
consent, vote, or approval of our shareholders. The risks faced by us are further increased as a result of its lack of resources and
our inability to provide a prospective business opportunity with significant capital. 

Our
History 

Organization
and Corporate History 

The
Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada on September 14, 2001 under the name Biocorp North America, Inc. On July 19, 2004 the
Company changed its name to Nat-UR, Inc. and on March 18, 2005 it changed its name again to Cereplast, Inc. 

We
developed and tried to commercializing proprietary bio-based resins through two complementary product families: Cereplast Compostables
resins which are compostable, renewable, ecologically sound substitutes for petroleum-based plastics, and Cereplast Sustainables resins
(including the Cereplast Hybrid Resins product line), which replaces up to 90 of the petroleum-based content of traditional plastics
with materials from renewable resources. In the summer of 2014, the Company ceased all operations and since that time has been inactive 

On
May 7, 2014, we voluntarily converted our Chapter 11 filing to a Chapter 7 filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District
of Indiana. We ceased all business activities in August 2014. On May 10, 2019, the Trustees Final Account, the Certification of
Full Administration and Application for Discharge was filed and accepted by the Court. All debts and liabilities were paid or discharged.
On May 11, 2019, the Bankruptcy Case was closed. 

On
March 22, 2019, the eight judicial District Court of Nevada appointed Custodian Ventures, LLC as custodian for Cereplast, Inc., proper
notice having been given to the officers and directors of Cereplast, Inc. There was no opposition. 

4 

On
June 04, 2019, the Company filed a certificate of revival with the state of Nevada, appointing David Lazar as, President, Secretary,
Treasurer and Director. 

A
change of control of the Company was completed on November 3, 2020, Pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated October 22, 2020 control
was obtained by the sale of 50,000,000 common shares and 5,000,000 Series A-1 Preferred Shares from Custodian Ventures, LLC to Xudong
Li. After November 3, 2020, the Company s operations are determined and structured by the new major shareholder. 

General
Business Plan 

Our
business plan to seek a merger has many uncertainties which pose risks to investors. 

We
intend to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in business opportunities presented to us by persons
or firms which desire to seek the advantages of an issuer who has complied with the Securities Act of 1934 (the 1934 Act ).
We will not restrict our search to any specific business, industry or geographical location, and we may participate in business ventures
of virtually any nature. This discussion of our proposed business is purposefully general and is not meant to be restrictive of our unlimited
discretion to search for and enter into potential business opportunities. We anticipate that we may be able to participate in only one
potential business venture because of our lack of financial resources. We may seek a business opportunity with entities which have recently
commenced operations, or that desire to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand into new
products or markets, to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes. All of these activities have risk to investors
including dilution and management. 

We
expect that the selection of a business opportunity will be complex. Due to general economic conditions, rapid technological advances
being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, we believe that there are numerous firms seeking the benefits of an
issuer who has complied with the 1934 Act. Such benefits may include facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing
may be sought, providing liquidity for incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, providing liquidity (subject to
restrictions of applicable statutes) for all stockholders and other factors. Potentially, available business opportunities may occur
in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis
of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. We have, and will continue to have, essentially no assets to provide
the owners of business opportunities. However, we will be able to offer owners of acquisition candidates the opportunity to acquire a
controlling ownership interest in an issuer who has complied with the 1934 Act without incurring the cost and time required to conduct
an initial public offering. 

The
analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by, or under the supervision of, our Board of Directors. We intend to concentrate
on identifying preliminary prospective business opportunities which may be brought to our attention through present associations of our
director, professional advisors or by our stockholders. In analyzing prospective business opportunities, we will consider such matters
as (i) available technical, financial and managerial resources; (ii) working capital and other financial requirements; (iii) history
of operations, if any, and prospects for the future; (iv) nature of present and expected competition; (v) quality, experience and depth
of management services; (vi) potential for further research, development or exploration; (vii) specific risk factors not now foreseeable
but that may be anticipated to impact the proposed activities of the company; (viii) potential for growth or expansion; (ix) potential
for profit; (x) public recognition and acceptance of products, services or trades; (xi) name identification; and (xii) other factors
that we consider relevant. As part of our investigation of the business opportunity, we expect to meet personally with management and
key personnel. To the extent possible, we intend to utilize written reports and personal investigation to evaluate the above factors. 

We
will not acquire or merge with any company for which audited financial statements cannot be obtained within a reasonable period of time
after closing of the proposed transaction. 

Acquisition
Interest 

In
implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint
venture, or licensing agreement with another company or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. Upon consummation
of a transaction, it is probable that our present management and stockholders will no longer be in control of us. In addition, our directors
may, as part of the terms of the acquisition transaction, resign and be replaced by new directors without a vote of our stockholders,
or sell his stock in us. Any such sale will only be made in compliance with the securities laws of the United States and any applicable
state. 

5 

It
is anticipated that any securities issued in any such reorganization would be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration under
application federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, as a negotiated element of the transaction, we may agree to register
all or a part of such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter. If such registration
occurs, it will be undertaken by the surviving entity after it has successfully consummated a merger or acquisition and is no longer
considered an inactive company. 

The
issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop in our securities may
have a depressive effect on the value of our securities in the future. There is no assurance that such a trading market will develop. 

While
the actual terms of a transaction cannot be predicted, it is expected that the parties to any business transaction will find it desirable
to avoid the creation of a taxable event and thereby structure the business transaction in a so-called tax-free reorganization
under Sections 368(a)(1) or 351 of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code ). In order to obtain tax-free treatment under the
Code, it may be necessary for the owner of the acquired business to own 80 or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. In such
event, our stockholders would retain less than 20 of the issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This would result in
significant dilution in the equity of our stockholders. 

As
part of our investigation, we expect to meet personally with management and key personnel, visit and inspect material facilities, obtain
independent analysis of verification of certain information provided, check references of management and key personnel, and take other
reasonable investigative measures, to the extent of our limited financial resources and management expertise. The manner in which we
participate in an opportunity will depend on the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of both parties, and the
management of the opportunity. 

With
respect to any merger or acquisition, and depending upon, among other things, the target company s assets and liabilities, our
stockholders will in all likelihood hold a substantially lesser percentage ownership interest in us following any merger or acquisition.
The percentage ownership may be subject to significant reduction in the event we acquire a target company with assets and expectations
of growth. Any merger or acquisition can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by our stockholders. 

We
will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate written business agreements. Although
the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally we anticipate that such agreements will (i) require specific representations
and warranties by all of the parties; (ii) specify certain events of default; (iii) detail the terms of closing and the conditions which
must be satisfied by each of the parties prior to and after such closing; (iv) outline the manner of bearing costs, including costs associated
with the Company s attorneys and accountants; (v) set forth remedies on defaults; and (vi) include miscellaneous other terms. 

As
stated above, we will not acquire or merge with any entity which cannot provide independent audited financial statements within a reasonable
period of time after closing of the proposed transaction. If such audited financial statements are not available at closing, or within
time parameters necessary to insure our compliance within the requirements of the 1934 Act, or if the audited financial statements provided
do not conform to the representations made by that business to be acquired, the definitive closing documents will provide that the proposed
transaction will be voidable, at the discretion of our present management. If such transaction is voided, the definitive closing documents
will also contain a provision providing for reimbursement for our costs associated with the proposed transaction. 

6 

The
Company is a Blank Check Company 

At
present, the Company is a development stage company with minimal assets and no specific business plan or purpose. The Company s
business plan is to seek new business opportunities or to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company. As a result,
the Company is a blank check company and, as a result, any offerings of the Company s securities under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act must comply with Rule 419 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the SEC under the Act. The Company s Common Stock is a penny stock, as defined in Rule 3a51-1 promulgated
by the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act. The Penny Stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in penny stock not
otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about Penny Stocks and
the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. 

The
broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer
and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each Penny Stock held in the customer s
account. Also, the Penny Stock rules require that the broker-dealer, not otherwise exempt from such rules, must make a special written
determination that the Penny Stock is suitable for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction.
These disclosure rules have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject
to the Penny Stock rules. So long as the common stock of the Company is subject to the Penny Stock rules, it may be more difficult to
sell the Company s common stock. 

We
are a Shell Company, as defined in Rule 405 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act. A Shell Company is one that
has no or nominal operations and either: (i) no or nominal assets; or (ii) assets consisting primarily of cash or cash equivalents. As
a Shell Company, we are restricted in our use of Registrations on Form S-8 under the Securities Act; the lack of availability of the
use of Rule 144 by security holders; and the lack of liquidity in our stock. 

Unavailability
of Rule 144 for Resale 

Rule
144(i) Unavailability to Securities of Issuers With No or Nominal Operations and No or Nominal Non-Cash Assets provides
that Rule 144 is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by an issuer that is a Shell Company. We have identified
our company as a Shell Company and, therefore, the holders of our securities may not rely on Rule 144 to have the restriction removed
from their securities without registration or until the Company is no longer identified as a Shell Company and has filed all requisite
periodic reports under the Exchange Act for twelve (12) months. 

As
a result of our classification as a Shell Company, our investors are not allowed to rely on the safe harbor provisions
of Rule 144, promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act, so as not to be considered underwriters in connection with the sale of our securities
until one year from the date that we cease to be a Shell Company. This will likely make it more difficult for us to attract additional
capital through subsequent unregistered offerings because purchasers of securities in such unregistered offerings will not be able to
resell their securities in reliance on Rule 144, a safe harbor on which holders of restricted securities usually rely to resell securities. 

Rule
419 of the Securities Act 

The
provisions of Rule 419 apply to registration statements filed under the Securities Act by a blank check company, such as the Company.
Rule 419 requires that a blank check company filing a registration statement deposit the securities being offered and proceeds of the
offering into an escrow or trust account pending the execution of an agreement for an acquisition or merger. While we are not currently
registering shares for an offering, we may do so in the future. 

In
addition, an issuer is required to file a post-effective amendment to a registration statement upon the execution of an agreement for
an acquisition or merger. The rule provides procedures for the release of the offering funds, if any, in conjunction with the post-effective
acquisition or merger. The obligations to file post-effective amendments are in addition to the obligations to file Forms 8-K to report
for both the entry into a material definitive (non-ordinary course of business) agreement and the completion of the transaction. Rule
419 applies to both primary and re-sale or secondary offerings. 

7 

Within
five (5) days of filing a post-effective amendment setting forth the proposed terms of an acquisition, the Company must notify each investor
whose shares are in escrow, if any. Each such investor then has no fewer than 20 and no greater than 45 business days to notify the Company
in writing if they elect to remain an investor. A failure to reply indicates that the person has elected to not remain an investor. As
all investors are allotted this second opportunity to determine to remain an investor, acquisition agreements should be conditioned upon
enough funds remaining in escrow to close the transaction. 

Competition 

We
believe we are an insignificant participant among the firms which engage in the acquisition of business opportunities. There are many
established venture capital and financial concerns that have significantly greater financial and personnel resources and technical expertise
than we have. In view of our limited financial resources and limited management availability, we will continue to be at a significant
competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors. 

Investment
Company Act 1940 

Although
we will be subject to regulation under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the 1934 Act, we believe we will not be subject to
regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act insofar as we will not be engaged in the business of
investing or trading in securities. In the event we engage in business combinations that result in us holding passive investment interests
in a number of entities, we could be subject to regulation under the 1940 Act. In such event, we would be required to register as an
investment company and incur significant registration and compliance costs. We have obtained no formal determination from the SEC as
to our status under the 1940 Act and, consequently, any violation of the 1940 Act would subject us to material adverse consequences.
We believe that, currently, we are exempt under Regulation 3a-2 of the 1940 Act. 

Intellectual
Property 

We
own no intellectual property. 

Employees 

We
presently have no full time executive, operational, or clerical staff. 

Ms.
Xudong has been a director and officer of the Company since 2020 and its principal shareholder. 

Factors
Effecting Future Performance 

Rather
than an operating business, our goal is to obtain debt and/or equity financing to meet our ongoing operating expenses and attempt to
merge with another entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock to create
value for our shareholders. 

Although
there is no assurance that this series of events will be successfully completed, we believe we can successfully complete an acquisition
or merger which will enable us to continue as a going concern. Any acquisition or merger will most likely be dilutive to our existing
stockholders.

Overview 

The
Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada on September 14, 2001 under the name Biocorp North America, Inc. On July 19, 2004 the
Company changed its name to Nat-UR, Inc. and on March 18, 2005 it changed its name again to Cereplast, Inc. 

We
developed and tried to commercializing proprietary bio-based resins through two complementary product families: Cereplast Compostables
resins which are compostable, renewable, ecologically sound substitutes for petroleum-based plastics, and Cereplast Sustainables resins
(including the Cereplast Hybrid Resins product line), which replaces up to 90 of the petroleum-based content of traditional plastics
with materials from renewable resources. Our resins could be converted into finished products using conventional manufacturing equipment
without significant additional capital investment by downstream converters. In the summer of 2014, the Company ceased all operations
and since that time has been inactive. 

On
March 22, 2019, the eight judicial District Court of Nevada appointed Custodian Ventures, LLC as custodian for Cereplast, Inc., proper
notice having been given to the officers and directors of Cereplast, Inc. There was no opposition. 

On
June 04, 2019, the Company filed a certificate of revival with the state of Nevada, appointing David Lazar as, President, Secretary,
Treasurer and Director. 

A
change of control of the Company was completed on November 3, 2020, control was obtained by the sale of 50,000,000 common shares and
 5,000,000 Series A-1 Preferred Shares from Custodian Ventures, LLC to Xudong Li. After November 3, 2020, the Company s operations
are determined and structured by the new major shareholder. 

10 

We
have not yet generated sustained profits from our prior operations. Our independent accountants have expressed a going concern 
opinion. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of 97,377,201 and a net working capital deficit of 111,524. 

While
our current burn rate is nominal, it is expected that our costs of operations will continue to exceed revenues, primarily due to the
costs associated with being a public reporting company. Based upon our current business plan, we may continue to incur losses in the
foreseeable future and there can be no assurances that we will ever establish profitable operations. These and other factors raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Critical
Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates 

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP ). The preparation of these consolidated
financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates. 

An
accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that
are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in
the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. We believe
that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements. 

Income
Taxes 

The
Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for future income taxes. Under this method, future income tax assets and
liabilities are recorded based on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their corresponding
tax basis. In addition, the future benefits of income tax assets including unused tax losses, are recognized, subject to a valuation
allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that such future benefits will ultimately be realized. Future income tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply when the tax liabilities or assets are to be either settled
or realized. The Company s effective tax rate approximates the Federal statutory rates. 

Results
of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2022 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021 

In
the summer of 2014, the Company decided to discontinue all operations. After the change of control on November 3, 2020, the Company s
operations are determined and structured by the new major shareholder. 

During
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we generated no revenues. 

Operating
expenses, including general and administrative expenses, during the year ended December 31, 2022, was 58,348 compared to 46,276 during
the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 12,072 or 26 . The increase was mainly due to the higher general and administrative
expenses, partly offset by lower professional fees. 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of 58,348, compared to a net loss of 46,276 during the year ended
December 31, 2021. The 12,072 increase in net loss was primarily due to the increase in operating expenses. 

11 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of December 31, 2022, and 2021, we had a cash balance of 0. Due to the lack of revenue, the company s operations are primarily
funded by the Company s CEO and major shareholder. 

To
the extent that the Company s capital resources are insufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements, the Company
will seek additional funds through equity or debt financing, collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners, licensees or
others, and from other sources, which may have the effect of diluting the holdings of existing shareholders. The Company has no current
arrangements with respect to, or sources of, such additional financing and the Company does not anticipate that existing shareholders
will provide any portion of the Company s future financing requirements. Ms. Xudong, the CEO and principal shareholder of the Company,
would favorably entertain funding, through loans, corporate expenses for approximately 24 months. Any loans by Ms. Xudong would be on
an interest-free basis, documented by a promissory note and payable only upon consummation of a business combination transaction. Upon
consummation of a business combination, we or the target may reimburse Ms. Xudong for any such loans from funds furnished by the target.
We have no written agreement with Ms. Xudong to advance any further funds for future operating expense, therefore there is no assurance
that such funds from Ms. Xudong will be forth coming, if required. 

No
assurance can be given that additional financing will be available when needed or that such financing will be available on terms acceptable
to the Company. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may be required to delay or terminate expenditures for certain of its
programs that it would otherwise seek to develop and commercialize. This would have a material adverse effect on the Company. These factors
raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. 

Operating
Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 0 during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Investing
Activities 

We
neither generated nor used cash in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Financing
Activities 

We
neither generated nor used cash in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying
financial statements, we have incurred net losses of 58,348 and 46,276 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively,
and have a working capital deficit of 111,524 as of December 31, 2022, in addition to a stockholder deficit of 111,524, which raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Management
believes the Company will continue to incur losses and negative cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future and will
need additional equity or debt financing to sustain its operations until it can achieve profitability and positive cash flows, if ever.
Management plans to seek additional debt and/or equity financing for the Company but cannot assure that such financing will be available
on acceptable terms. 

The
Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to ultimately attain profitable operations, generate sufficient
cash flow to meet its obligations, and obtain additional financing as may be required. Our auditors have included a going concern 
qualification in their Report of Independent Certified Public Accountants accompanying our audited financial statements appearing elsewhere
herein which cites substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Such a going concern qualification
may make it more difficult for us to raise funds when needed. The outcome of this uncertainty cannot be assured. 

12 

The
accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There can be
no assurance that management will be successful in implementing its business plan or that the successful implementation of such business
plan will actually improve our operating results. 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We
have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or
capital resources and would be considered material to investors 

Inflation 

We
do not believe that inflation has had in the past or will have in the future any significant negative impact on our operations.

 Controls
 And Procedures. 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Based
upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures performed by our Chief Executive Officer as of the
end of the period covered by this report, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures have not
been effective as a result of a weakness in the design of internal control over financial reporting identified below. 

As
used herein, disclosure controls and procedures mean controls and other procedures of our company that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls
and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us
in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting ICFR ), as such term
is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Accounting Officer
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our ICFR based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO 2013 ). Based on management s evaluation under
the framework, management has concluded that our ICFR was not effective as of December 31, 2022. 

13 

We
identified material weaknesses in our ICFR primarily attributable to (i) lack of segregation of incompatible duties; and (ii) insufficient
Board of Directors representation. These weaknesses are due to our inadequate staffing during the period covered by this report and our
lack of working capital to hire additional staff. Management has retained an outside, independent financial consultant to record and
review all financial data, as well as prepare our financial reports, in order to mitigate this weakness. Although management will periodically
re-evaluate this situation, at this point it considers that the risk associated with such lack of segregation of duties and the potential
benefits of adding employees to segregate such duties are not cost justified. We intend to hire additional accounting personnel to assist
with financial reporting as soon as our finances will allow. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding ICFR. Management s report
was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission
that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To
the shareholders and the board of directors of Hong Yuan Holding Group 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hong Yuan Holding Group as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements
of operations, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

Substantial
Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
3 to the financial statements, the Company s significant operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue
as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. 

We
determined that there are no critical audit matters.

The

planning, raising capital, and research into products which may become part of the Company s product portfolio. The Company has
not realized significant sales since inception. A development stage company is defined as one in which all efforts are devoted substantially
to establishing a new business and, even if planned principal operations have commenced, revenues are insignificant.

Company is planning potential acquisitions. The management has approached several companies in China and met the management of potential

and planned operating activities, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional equity capital, or be successful
in the development and commercialization of the products it develops or initiates collaboration agreements thereon. The accompanying
financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of
assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going
concern.
