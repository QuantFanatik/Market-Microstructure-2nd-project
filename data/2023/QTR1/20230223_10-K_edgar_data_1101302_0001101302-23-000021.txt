 Item 1. Business. 
 OUR COMPANY 
 Entegris, Inc. Entegris , the Company , us , we , or our is a leading supplier of advanced materials and process solutions for the semiconductor and other high-technology industries. We help our customers maximize manufacturing yields, reduce manufacturing costs and enable higher device performance by leveraging our unique breadth of capabilities to provide mission critical enhanced materials and process solutions for the most advanced manufacturing environments. 
 
 Semiconductors, or integrated circuits, are key components in electronic devices that have changed, and that we believe will continue to change, the way we live, communicate and work. Products and emerging applications such as smartphones, 5G wireless technology, cloud computing, the Internet of Things, machine learning, artificial intelligence, high performance computing, smart transportation, smart healthcare, gaming and virtual reality will require faster, more powerful and more energy efficient semiconductors. We believe these new trends, combined with existing applications, will drive long-term secular growth for semiconductors. We expect that demand for semiconductors will reach 1 trillion by 2030, which would create significant new opportunities for our products. 
 
 To meet requirements for improved chip performance and density, semiconductor manufacturing processes have rapidly become increasingly complex by moving to smaller geometries and adopting new device architectures. These complex processes are enabled by new and innovative materials; and higher materials purity, quality and stability are critical to improving and maximizing yields. We believe Entegris offers the industry s most comprehensive electronic materials portfolio, operating squarely at the crossroads of material science and materials purity. These two core capabilities are quickly becoming critical enablers of our customers technology roadmaps. These trends are expected to translate to a higher served addressable market and expanding Entegris content per wafer and, by extension, growth above the market for Entegris. 
 
 Our business is organized and operated in four operating segments, which align with the key elements of the advanced semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem. 
 The Specialty Chemicals and Engineered Materials segment, or SCEM, provides high-performance and high-purity process chemistries, gases and materials, and safe and efficient materials delivery systems to support semiconductor and other advanced manufacturing processes. 
 The Advanced Planarization Solutions segment, or APS, provides complementary chemical mechanical planarization solutions, advanced materials and high-purity wet chemicals; including chemical mechanical planarization CMP slurries, pads, formulated cleans and other electronic chemicals. 
 The Microcontamination Control segment, or MC, offers solutions to filter and purify critical liquid and gaseous chemistries used in semiconductor manufacturing processes and other high-technology industries. 
 The Advanced Materials Handling segment, or AMH, develops solutions to monitor, protect, transport and deliver critical liquid chemistries, wafers and other substrates for a broad set of applications in the semiconductor industry, life sciences and other high-technology industries. 
 
 These segments share common business systems and processes, technology centers and technology roadmaps. With the complementary capabilities across these segments, we believe we are uniquely positioned to create new, co-optimized and increasingly integrated solutions for our customers. For example, after the acquisition of CMC Materials, Inc. CMC Materials ), we now offer an end-to-end offering for our customers consisting of advanced deposition materials from our SCEM segment, CMP slurries, pads and post-CMP cleaning chemistries from our APS segment, CMP slurry filters from our MC segment, and CMP slurry high-purity packaging and fluid monitoring systems from our AMH segment.

 THE SEMICONDUCTOR ECOSYSTEM 
 
 The manufacture of semiconductors requires hundreds of highly complex and sensitive manufacturing steps, during which a variety of materials are repeatedly applied to a silicon wafer to build integrated circuits on the wafer surface. The areas of the semiconductor ecosystem that rely most heavily on our products and solutions are described below. 
 
 Etch and Resist Strip . During the etch process, specific areas of thin film that have been deposited on the surface of a wafer are removed to leave a desired circuit pattern. After the etch process, the hardened resist must be completely removed and the etched area must be cleaned, which requires the use of high purity chemicals. Several of our products are utilized during and after the etch process, including: 
 
 Selective etch chemistries to enable high aspect ratio structures, such as 3D-NAND; 
 Formulated cleaning solutions and high-purity wet chemicals to remove photoresists and post-etch residues; 
 Filters and purifiers, which help to ensure the purity of formulated cleaning chemistries and to achieve desired yields in the etch processing steps; and 
 Precision-engineered coatings to provide barriers to corrosive chemistries in the etch environment, protect surfaces of equipment components from erosion and minimize particle generation. 
 
 Deposition . Deposition is a process during which certain materials are transferred to the surface of a wafer. Deposition processes include physical vapor deposition, or PVD, chemical vapor deposition, or CVD, atomic-layer deposition, or ALD, and electro-plating. We provide products that can be used during most of these deposition processes that are critical to enabling new device architectures, which are deigned to ensure device performance and achieve the targeted manufacturing yields of semiconductor manufacturers, including: 
 
 Advanced precursor materials, such as AlCl3, MoO2Cl2, HfCl4, and ZrCl4, which are utilized to meet the semiconductor industry s composition, uniformity and thickness requirements of deposited films; and 
 Filtration and purification products, which are used to remove contaminants during the deposition process, consequently reducing defects on wafers. 
 
 Photolithography . Photolithography, a process repeated during semiconductor fabrication, is used to print complex circuit patterns onto the wafer. During this process, the wafer is coated with a thin film of light-sensitive material, called photoresist. Light is projected to expose the photoresist, which is then developed to create a pattern. Our product offerings that can be used throughout the photolithography process, include: 
 
 Liquid filtration, high-purity packaging and high-precision dispense systems designed to ensure the pure, accurate and uniform dispense of contamination-free photoresists onto the wafer, enabling manufacturers to achieve acceptable yields in the manufacturing process; and 
 Gas microcontamination control solutions designed to eliminate airborne contaminants that often disrupt effective photolithography processes. 
 
 Ion Implant . Ion implantation is a method repeated many times during semiconductor fabrication where dopants are introduced into a semiconductor wafer enhancing conductivity. Those of our products used during the ion implant process include: 
 
 Safe Delivery Source , or SDS , and Vacuum Actuated Cylinders, or VAC , gas delivery systems designed to ensure the safe, effective and efficient delivery of the necessary gases; and 
 Electrostatic chucks and proprietary low temperature plasma coating processes for core components, which are critical elements of ion implantation equipment. 
 
 Chemical Mechanical Planarization . Chemical mechanical planarization, or CMP, is a polishing process used by semiconductor manufacturers to planarize, or flatten, many of the layers of material that have been deposited on silicon wafers.

Table of Contents 

 We expanded our offerings used during and immediately following the CMP process with the acquisition of CMC Materials. Our offerings include: 
 
 CMP slurries for polishing a wide range of materials used in semiconductors, including tungsten, dielectric materials, copper, tantalum (commonly referred to as barrier ), aluminum, silicon carbide, or SiC, and gallium nitride, or GaN; 
 CMP polishing pads, which are used in conjunction with slurries in the CMP process, used on a variety of polishing tools and wafers, over a range of technology nodes and applications, including tungsten, copper, and dielectrics; 
 Formulated cleaning chemistries, which remove residues from wafer surfaces after the CMP process; 
 Filtration and purification solutions, which are used to remove select particles and contaminants from slurries and cleaning chemistries that can cause defects on a wafer s surface; 
 Roller brushes, which are used in conjunction with our formulated cleaning chemistries to clean the wafer after completion of the CMP process in order to prepare the wafer for subsequent operations; 
 Pad conditioners, which are used to prepare the surface of the CMP polishing pad prior to every polishing cycle; and 
 Process monitoring and control equipment, that maintain the integrity of the CMP slurries. 
 
 Wafer and Reticle Transport . Our wafer carriers are high-purity micro-environments that carry wafers between manufacturing process steps. These critical products protect wafers from damage or abrasion and minimize contamination during transportation and automated processing. Protection of processed wafers is essential to our customers because wafer processing involves hundreds of steps, can take several weeks and therefore scrapping damaged wafers is costly. Our extreme ultraviolet (EUV) reticle pod is designed to provide defect-free protection of EUV reticles during shipping, storage, handling, and vacuum-transferring operations. 
 
 Chemical Handling . Semiconductor manufacturing and other high-technology manufacturing processes utilize large volumes of high-purity and hazardous chemicals. We provide solutions for the handling of such chemicals, including: 
 
 Ultra-high purity chemical container products, such as drums, flexible packaging and associated coded connection systems, which are designed to maintain chemical purity, maximize utilization and ensure safe transport, containment and dispense of valuable, ultra-clean process fluids, from bulk chemical manufacturing to point-of-use in the manufacturing process; and 
 Ultra-pure valves, fittings, tubings and sensing and control products, which are used to distribute these chemicals around the fab and in wet process tools. 
 
 Wafer and Package Testing . In our ITS business, which was added to our platform as part of the CMC Materials acquisition, we develop and manufacture high-performance consumable products for cleaning advanced probe cards and test sockets at semiconductor manufacturing facilities. We also design innovative polymer products for semiconductor fabs that improve front-end tool uptime and reduce operating costs. 
 
 Other Markets . Many of the processes used to manufacture semiconductors are also used to manufacture flat panel displays, high-purity chemicals, solar cells, optical magnetic storage devices and light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, resulting in the need for similar filtration, purification, control and measurement capabilities. We seek to leverage our products, technologies, expertise and core capabilities to address these important market opportunities and pursue opportunities in certain life sciences applications. 
 
 INDUSTRY TRENDS 
 
 Emerging and Existing Applications . The market for semiconductors has grown significantly over the past few decades, and we expect this long-term trend to continue. We believe that smartphones, 5G wireless technology, cloud computing, the Internet of Things, machine learning, artificial intelligence, high performance computing, smart transportation, smart healthcare, gaming and virtual reality will drive growth in the demand for semiconductors, drive wafer starts and create significant opportunities for our products. Existing applications in data processing, wireless communications, broadband infrastructure, personal computers, handheld electronic devices and other consumer electronics are also expected to drive demand for semiconductors, and in turn, demand for our products. 
 
 Manufacturing Complexity and Architecture . Emerging applications require more powerful, faster and more energy-efficient semiconductors. In response, semiconductor architectures are changing, with transistor design increasing in complexity, the use of multilayered patterning (for example, extreme ultraviolet lithography), structures such as FinFET, 3D NAND and gate-all-around, and shrinking dimensions. These advanced architectures require more process steps, new, innovative materials and more sophisticated contamination control. For example, leading-edge semiconductor manufacturers are moving towards atomic layer scale, where the precision of the manufacturing process and purity of the materials used is vital to maintain device integrity. These materials need to be supplied and delivered at increasing levels of purity and control,

Table of Contents 

 from point-of-production to point-of-dispense on the wafer to improve and maximize yields. We believe that demand for our materials and consumable products will benefit from the increase in process steps in lithography, deposition, CMP and etch and clean required to manufacture leading-edge semiconductors. 
 
 Advanced Materials . New advanced materials have played a significant role in enabling improved device performance, and we expect this trend to continue. As dimensions get smaller, more novel materials will be required to enable transistor connectivity. We believe our portfolio of critical materials addresses the challenges our customers face as they introduce more complex architectures and search for new materials to improve the performance of their devices. These critical materials include advanced deposition materials, implant gases, CMP slurries, formulated cleaning chemistries, selective etch chemistries and high-purity wet chemicals. 
 
 Materials Purity . As feature size decreases and 3D structures proliferate, contamination control has become a critical enabler for our semiconductor customers in achieving acceptable device yields. Our advanced filtration and purification products and solutions for air, bulk or specialty gas, and wet chemicals are designed to reduce defects and enable higher yields for our customers. Our materials handling solutions protect critical materials throughout the fabrication process, allowing our customers to store, process and transport critical materials in ultra-pure environments, throughout the manufacturing process. We believe that the trend for greater materials purity will provide opportunities to utilize our capabilities to provide innovative materials management, filtration, purification, transport and process solutions to semiconductor customers. 
 
 Geopolitical Implications of the Semiconductor Industry . We have seen, and expect to continue to see, governments have an interest in fostering the development of a domestic or local semiconductor ecosystem. Examples include the CHIPS Act, EU CHIPS Act and similar initiatives in Japan and Korea. We have been proactive in light of these trends by developing a manufacturing strategy to better serve our customers as they build new fabs in various countries. Recent examples of this strategy include new facility located in Kaohsiung Science Park KSP in Taiwan and the recent announcement of our new facility in Colorado Springs, CO. Our KSP site will soon become our largest facility and will enhance our ability to serve our customers efficiently and effectively in Taiwan and other Asia-pacific locations. The Colorado Springs site is intended to increase our service levels to new fabs expected to be built in the United States and provide us with greater manufacturing resiliency in the form of enhanced business continuity plans. 
 
 Reliance on Trusted Suppliers . Our customers require that their key materials suppliers demonstrate greater capabilities and efficiencies in their processes, including sustainability, scalability, flexible manufacturing, quality control, supply chain management and the ability to effectively collaborate on solutions to problems. We believe that we will be able to leverage our manufacturing, operational and technical capabilities, along with our broad technology portfolio and expanding scale, to become an increasingly important strategic supplier to our customers. We have deployed technical and manufacturing resources in strategic locations to enable us to collaborate with our customers. Furthermore, we believe that the greater scale we achieved from the acquisition of CMC Materials will allow us to better serve our customers, invest more in ER D and bring complementary, co-optimized solutions to market faster than ever before. 
 
 Continued Consolidation . Our customer base within the semiconductor industry has consolidated in recent years through mergers and acquisitions. As a result, the importance of maintaining and developing strong and close relationships with our customers becomes even more essential. We also seek to further broaden our customer base by leveraging our products, technologies, expertise and core capabilities in serving semiconductor applications to address adjacent market opportunities, including in manufacturing processes for flat panel displays, high-purity chemicals, solar cells, optical magnetic storage devices, LEDs and products for life sciences applications. 
 
 OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS AND BUSINESS STRATEGY 
 
 We believe that our platform is well-positioned for several reasons. 
 
 Following the acquisition of CMC Materials, approximately 80 of our revenue during 2022 was unit driven or recurring in nature, from products consumed as a result of the semiconductor manufacturing process. As a result, our revenue is generally more impacted by overall global semiconductor demand and global GDP growth, rather than the sales of semiconductor capital equipment, which has historically been more cyclical. 
 Our solutions are increasingly specified and tailored to meet our customers unique process conditions. Therefore, switching away from our products may be costly and time consuming for our customers and may introduce risk to their manufacturing yields. 
 Our product portfolio is broad and not overly concentrated on any single product or product platform. As of December 31, 2022, we offered over 30,000 standard and customized products, and in 2022 no single product platform represented more than 4 of our net sales. 
 4 

Table of Contents 

 Our customer base is diverse, and we are not overly dependent on any one single customer. As of December 31, 2022, our top ten customers make up 43 of our sales. Our customers include a broad cross-section of the semiconductor ecosystem, from chemical manufacturers, and equipment manufacturers, to semiconductor manufacturers. 
 We believe the cash generated from our business will allow us to pay down our debt on the time frame we have publicly communicated, while also investing in the research and development and advanced manufacturing capabilities necessary to maintain and expand our technology leadership and to drive organic growth. 
 
 Customers Collaboration . We view the strong relationships we have with our customers, which include leading logic and memory semiconductor manufacturers, original equipment manufacturers OEMs and semiconductor materials suppliers, as critical to our long-term success. Our expansive global presence allows us to meet our customers where they operate, which has enabled us to build strong relationships with them. We intend to reinforce and further strengthen these relationships through, among other things, collaborations and joint development activity. These customer relationships provide us with collaboration opportunities at the early product design stage (in certain cases years ahead of commercialization), which facilitate our ability to introduce new products and applications that serve our customers needs. Due to the specialized nature of our products, complexity of our customers manufacturing processes, customer qualification requirements and costs associated with re-formulation and re-qualification, we believe we have a strong position with our customers. 
 
 Technology Leadership and Strong, Diverse Portfolio . Our customers need suppliers that can provide a broad range of advanced, customized, reliable and cost-effective products and materials, as well as the technological and application expertise necessary to enhance their productivity, quality and yield, especially as they drive towards more advanced technology nodes. We are committed to our strategy of providing customers with innovative technologies and solutions for their evolving manufacturing needs and we continuously seek to engage with leading logic and memory manufacturers to further advance their technology roadmaps. For example, we have introduced sub-5 nanometer filtration products, advanced deposition materials for next generation transistor and interconnect technologies, polishing slurry and pad solutions with post-cleaning formulations to meet the needs of advanced memory applications, advanced reticle pods for extreme ultra-violet, or EUV, photolithography applications, advanced 300 millimeter wafer carriers and advanced coatings to meet the rigorous defectivity specifications for the manufacturing of advanced technology nodes. We believe our comprehensive offering of materials and products creates a competitive advantage as it enables us to meet a broad range of customer needs and provide a single source of product offerings for semiconductor device and equipment manufacturers, which can often translate to shorter time-to-solution and time-to-market for our customers. Additionally, it allows us to serve many aspects of the semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem and to leverage our technology to develop co-optimized solutions. 
 
 To continue to advance our technology and product offerings, particularly to meet the needs of next generation technology nodes, we are committed to plans for significant investment in research and development initiatives, having spent approximately 229.0 million, 167.6 million and 136.1 million on such activities in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing 7.0 , 7.3 and 7.3 of our net sales, in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our research and development efforts have been increasingly directed towards innovation for advanced technology nodes. We plan to continue making substantial investments in research and development activities. 
 
 Global Infrastructure . We have a global infrastructure of design, manufacturing, logistics, distribution, service and technical support facilities to meet the needs of our global customers. We are further enhancing this footprint with the construction of a new manufacturing center of excellence in Taiwan, our KSP facility, which will be our largest manufacturing facility and is expected to start production in 2023. In addition, we have recently announced an investment in a new facility in Colorado Spring, CO and added new capacity in liquid filtration in the Billerica, MA and Yonezawa, Japan, in deposition materials in Toronto, and materials handling in Chaska, MN and JangAn, Korea. These investments are intended to better support our customers regionally and to be even more responsive to our customers future growth. 
 
 Operational Excellence . Our customers are increasingly focused on the effectiveness, dependability and consistency of their supply chains. Our strategy is to continue to develop our broad supply chain and manufacturing capabilities into a competitive advantage by driving operational excellence and operating in a manner that ensures the safety of our employees and the quality of our products. We are focused on the following priorities that we believe enable us to perform at the high level that our customers expect. 
 
 Investing in and using manufacturing equipment and facilities incorporating leading-edge process technology, including advanced cleanroom and cleaning procedures. 
 Implementing automated manufacturing, statistical process controls, quality and supply chain management systems. 
 Maintaining a highly-skilled and agile organization, capable of rapid design, prototyping and ramping to high volume manufacturing while promptly responding to new customer requirements and feedback. 
 
 Leveraging Our Collective Expertise . We leverage our expertise across our four segments and across our broad portfolio of advanced materials, materials handling and purification capabilities to create innovative, new and co-optimized solutions to

 address unmet customer needs. For example, certain of our formulated cleaning chemistry products are developed and manufactured by our SCEM segment, with collaboration from our MC segment, packaged with our ultra-clean container and connector system made by our AMH segment, and delivered to the process tools through fluid handling systems also made by our AMH segment. In process tools, these chemistries may go through purification systems produced by our MC segment. Similarly, our advanced deposition materials business requires comprehensive capabilities across several disciplines, including the synthetization of unique molecules, specialized knowledge of how to purify these materials and the capability to safely transport and deliver them onto the wafer at a high throughput. With the addition of CMC Materials, we will seek to develop co-optimized, end-to-end solutions and bring them to market more quickly, such as polishing solutions for new deposition materials and optimized filtration solutions for new abrasive materials. Further, as the semiconductor industry looks to new interconnect metals like molybdenum, our portfolio of deposition precursors, CMP slurries and pads, post-CMP cleans, selective etch formulations, combined with our filtration, sensing, and delivery products will enable us to create end-to-end solutions and position our customers to enhance their device performance and yield.

 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry 
 Declines in the semiconductor industry or worldwide economic conditions may cause demand for our products to decrease and may adversely affect our business. 
 
 Declines in industry or worldwide economic conditions, including the prospect of a recession, rising inflation, fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates or tightening credit markets, may adversely affect our business. Our revenue is primarily dependent upon demand from semiconductor manufacturers, which is largely driven by the current and anticipated demand for electronic products that utilize semiconductors. Despite secular trends of increasing demand for semiconductors in 
 15 

Table of Contents 

 applications such as smartphones, 5G wireless technology, cloud computing, the Internet of Things, machine learning, artificial intelligence, high performance computing, smart transportation, smart healthcare, gaming and virtual reality, the semiconductor industry has historically been, and is likely to continue to be, cyclical with periodic significant downturns, resulting in significantly decreased demand for products such as ours. We have previously experienced significant revenue deterioration and operating losses due to severe downturns in the semiconductor industry, which often occur suddenly. The semiconductor industry is also affected by seasonal shifts in demand, and as a result, we expect short-term fluctuation of demand within several quarters. We are unable to predict the timing, duration or severity of any future downturns in the semiconductor industry. 
 
 During downturns and periods of soft demand, our revenue is reduced, and we typically experience greater pricing pressure and shifts in product and customer mix, which often adversely affect our gross margin and net income. Furthermore, to remain competitive, we must maintain our engineering, research and development activity, invest in our infrastructure and maintain flexibility to respond to any increases in demand. As a result, a lower volume of sales can have a large and disproportionate impact on our profitability. Even moderate seasonality can cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from one period to the next. Uncertain and volatile economic, political, public health or business conditions in any of our key sales regions can cause or exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and have historically impacted customer demand for our products. These conditions can cause material adverse changes in our results of operations and financial condition, including: 
 a decline in demand for our products, which would have an immediate impact on our revenues; 
 an increase in reserves for accounts receivable due to our customers inability to pay us; 
 lower utilization of our manufacturing facilities, which could lead to lower margins; 
 an increase in write-offs for excess or obsolete inventory that we cannot sell; 
 potential impairment charges relating to goodwill, intangible assets, manufacturing equipment or other long-lived assets, to the extent that any downturn indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable; 
 greater challenges in forecasting operating results, making business decisions and identifying and prioritizing business risks; and 
 additional cost reduction efforts, including additional restructuring activities, which may adversely affect our ability to capitalize on opportunities. 
 
 Our revenues and operating results are variable. 
 
 Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year due to a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. We manage our expenses based in part on our expectations of future revenues. Because some of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, a change in the timing of revenue or the amount of profit we generate from a small number of transactions can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular period. Factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include: 
 economic conditions in the semiconductor industry or in the other industries we serve; 
 the size and timing of customer orders; 
 consolidation of our customers, which could impact their purchasing decisions and negatively affect our revenues; 
 procurement shortages, increased prices, the failure of suppliers to perform their obligations and additional expenses to respond promptly to any supply shortages or other supplier problems; 
 decisions to increase or accelerate our purchasing of raw materials, components or other supplies in an effort to mitigate supply risk; 
 changes in our capital expenditure requirements, such as our KSP facility in Taiwan and our newly announced planned facility in Colorado Springs, and the schedule and timing, including potential delays, thereof; 
 manufacturing difficulties; 
 customer decisions to decelerate orders in order to draw down their inventory; 
 customer cancellations of or delays in shipments, installations or customer acceptances or, alternatively, acceleration of orders from customers to increase their inventory; 
 our customers rate of replacement of our consumable products or decision to delay expansion projects; 
 changes in average selling prices, customer mix and product mix; 
 our ability to develop, introduce and market new, enhanced and competitive products in a timely manner; 
 our competitors introduction of new products; 
 16 

Table of Contents 

 disruptions in transportation, communication, demand, information technology or supply, including strikes, acts of God, wars, terrorist activities and natural or man-made disasters; 
 legal, tax, accounting or regulatory changes (including changes in import/export regulations and tariffs) or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing requirements; 
 changes in our estimated tax rate; and 
 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and could further impact, many of these factors. 
 
 We serve constantly evolving industries, and any failure to manage our business effectively during periods of rapid change may adversely affect our business performance and results of operations. 
 
 Intense competition in the semiconductor industry often leads to rapid changes in products and technology. These changes, along with shifts in demands for semiconductors, can significantly alter demand for our products; the amount and mix of customers spending on our products can significantly impact our results of operations. Changes in demand may arise from factors such as advances in fabrication processes, new and emerging technologies, end-user demand, customers production capacity and customers capacity utilization. We must accurately forecast demand for each of our products and effectively manage our resources and production capacity across our various businesses. Although we regularly reassess our allocation of resources in response to the changing business environment, we may incur unexpected or additional costs to align our operations with demand. If we do not adequately anticipate changes in our business environment, we may lack the infrastructure, manufacturing capacity and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during a period of growth, or we may expand our capacity too rapidly, resulting in excess fixed costs. 
 
 Our ability to increase sales of our products, particularly our capital equipment products, depends in part upon our ability, in a very short timeframe, to ramp up our manufacturing capacity and to mobilize our supply chain. If we are unable to expand our manufacturing capacity on a timely basis, manage the expansion effectively and obtain larger quantities of raw materials, our customers could obtain products from our competitors, which would reduce our market share, harm our reputation as a trusted partner and impact our results of operations. These challenges have been and may continue to be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, we continued to face instances where our manufacturing capacity or supply chain was constrained and the lead time to manufacture and deliver our customers products was extended. If we are unable to meet our customers demand for our products or deliver our products within our customers required lead times, our customers may seek to replace us with alternative suppliers. Additionally, in the last two years, we have seen increased inventory levels in a challenging supply chain environment. Failure to adjust our inventory to more normalized levels may lead to an increased risk of excess and obsolete inventory and harm our cash flow. 
 
 Interruptions in our supply chain, including our single and limited source suppliers, could affect our ability to manufacture our products, meet demand, increase costs and have an adverse effect on our revenue results of operations. 
 
 Our supply chain is critical to the supply of our products and solutions to meet the quality, demand and technology requirements our customers. We rely on the timely delivery of parts, materials and services, including components and subassemblies, from our suppliers and contract manufacturers. Alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single provider or supplier will adversely affect our business are not feasible in all circumstances. For example, we rely on single or limited source suppliers for certain raw materials that are critical to the manufacturing of our products, such as plastic polymers, filtration membranes, abrasive particles, petroleum coke and other materials. If we were to lose any one of these or other critical sources, or there is as an industry-wide increase in demand for, or the discontinuation of, raw materials used in our products, it could be difficult for us, or we may be unable, to find an alternative supplier or raw material, in which case our operations could be adversely affected. When these events occur, we work proactively and collaboratively with the supplier to solve the manufacturing issue in order to reestablish the supply of these materials or find alternative materials and work with our customers through their vigorous qualification process. 
 
 Demand for semiconductors, electronic products, and other factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a shortage of raw materials and components needed to manufacture and deliver our products, as well as increased costs and risks associated with qualifying products that are manufactured using new raw materials and delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions , all of which could harm our reputation or the competitiveness of our products . Such shortages, delays and unpredictability have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our suppliers ability to meet our demand requirements, have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our manufacturing operations and our ability to meet customer demand and have impacted in the past, and may impact in the future, our gross margins and our other operating results. Our actions to counteract adverse impacts 
 17 

Table of Contents 

 to our gross margins and other operating results, could be unsuccessful, or could have the effect of reducing demand, which would adversely impact our revenue. Additionally, our suppliers may not have the capacity to meet increases in our demand for raw materials, in turn, making us unable to meet demand from our customers. If our suppliers or sub-suppliers are unable to maintain their operations, due to operational restrictions or financial hardship caused by an economic slowdown or recession, we may increase our safety stocks of raw materials or components or alter our payment terms with such suppliers, including prepaying for raw materials, which could put downward pressure on our cash flow. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic and continuing governmental responses has and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, an impact on the global economy and continues to cause macroeconomic uncertainty. Governmental authorities around the globe implemented, and may again in the future implement, numerous and evolving measures in response to the virus. Although countries around the world largely reopened in 2022, there remains significant uncertainty in certain jurisdictions, most notably, China. Any future constraints, limitations or modifications imposed on our operations or business practices, or those of our suppliers, may limit our ability to meet customer demand, cause us to increase our safety stock of certain materials, reduce our productivity, slow or diminish our research and development activities, make our products less competitive, or cause our customers to seek alternative suppliers and delay customer qualification activities, any of which could harm our business, reduce our profitability or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The degree to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of any future outbreaks, their severity, potential additional waves of infection, the emergence of more virulent or more dangerous strains of the virus, the actions to mitigate the virus and its impact, the development, distribution, efficacy and acceptance of vaccines, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. 
 
 We are exposed to the risks of operating a global business, as a significant amount of our sales and manufacturing activity occur outside the United States. 
 
 Sales to customers outside the United States accounted for approximately 76 , 77 and 75 of our net sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a majority of our net sales. In addition, a number of our key domestic customers derive a significant portion of their revenues from sales in international markets. We also manufacture a significant portion of our products outside the United States and depend on international suppliers for many of our parts and raw materials. We intend to continue to pursue opportunities in both sales and manufacturing internationally. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks and potential costs that could adversely affect our revenue and profitability, including: 
 global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade and export regulations, trade policies and sanctions, tariffs, and international trade disputes, including new and changing export regulations for certain exports to China, where we have significant business, and any retaliatory measures, which could impose additional costs on our operations and limit our ability to operate our business and which could adversely impact us, our customers or our suppliers; 
 positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national, commercial and/or security issues posed by the development, sale or export of certain products and technologies; 
 geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as Russia s invasion of Ukraine or increasing tensions with China, political and economic instability and uncertainty, which may result in severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of sovereign debt, declining valuation of certain investments, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, volatility in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability; 
 challenges in hiring and integrating workers in different countries; 
 challenges in managing a diverse workforce with different experience levels, languages, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations, along with differing employment practices and labor issues; 
 challenges of maintaining appropriate business processes, procedures and internal controls and complying with legal, environmental, health and safety, anti-bribery, anti-corruption and other regulatory requirements that vary by jurisdiction; 
 challenges in developing relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments; 
 fluctuating pricing and availability of raw materials and supply chain interruptions or slowdowns, including as a result of difficulties, financial or otherwise, faced by segments of the transportation industry; 
 18 

Table of Contents 

 public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and related implications thereof; 
 expense and complexity of complying with U.S. and foreign import and export regulations, including the ability to obtain required import and export licenses; 
 fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies that are important to our business, including the Japanese yen, euro, Taiwanese dollar, Korean won, Chinese renminbi, Singapore dollar, Malaysian ringgit, Canadian dollar or Israeli shekel, which could cause our sales and profitability to decline; 
 liability for foreign taxes assessed at rates higher than those applicable to our domestic operations; 
 challenges and costs associated with the protection of our intellectual property throughout the world; and 
 customer or government efforts to encourage operations and sourcing in a particular country, such as Korea or China, including efforts to develop and grow local competitors, require local manufacturing, and provide special incentives to government-backed local customers to buy from local competitors. 
 
 In the past, these factors have disrupted our operations and increased our costs, and we expect that these factors will continue to do so in the future. Furthermore, there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships among China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the United States, that political, diplomatic and national security influences could lead to trade disputes, impacts and/or disruptions, in particular those affecting the semiconductor industry. This can adversely affect our business with China, Japan, Korea, and/or Taiwan and perhaps the entire Asia Pacific region or global economy. A significant trade dispute, impact and/or disruption in any area where we do business could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits. 
 
 Tariffs, export controls and other trade laws and restrictions resulting from international trade disputes, strained international relations and changes to foreign and national security policy, especially as they relate to China, could have an adverse impact on our operations and reduce the competitiveness or availability of our products relative to local and global competitors. 
 
 Tariffs, additional taxes, trade barriers and other measures, particularly those arising out of relations between the United States and China, may increase costs of raw materials and our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. For example, both the United States and China have implemented several rounds of tariffs and retaliations with respect to certain products imported from the other country, some of which have impacted certain raw materials we use. Our operational changes in an effort to mitigate the impact of these tariffs on our products may not be successful. 
 
 In addition, we are subject to export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations that restrict the delivery of some of our products and services to certain end users, countries and nationals of certain countries. In certain circumstances, these restrictions may prohibit the transfer of certain of our products, services and technologies, and in other circumstances they may require us to obtain a license from the U.S. government before delivering the controlled item or service. Obtaining export licenses may be difficult, costly and time-consuming, and there is no assurance that we will be issued licenses that we apply for on a timely basis or at all. We must also comply with export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations imposed by other countries. Our export and trade control compliance program may be ineffective or circumvented, exposing us to legal liabilities. Compliance with these laws could significantly limit our sales in the future. Changes in, and responses to, U.S. trade controls could reduce the competitiveness of our products and cause our sales to drop, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Over the last several years, the U.S. government has significantly expanded export controls on certain technologies and commodities to certain markets, particularly with respect to semiconductor and other high technology exports to China. For example, on October 7, 2022, the U.S. Commerce Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security BIS announced new export control regulations that restrict the sale of certain products and services to some companies and domestic fabs in China. Additionally, effective June 29, 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed new export controls on the transfer of many U.S. products and technologies, including many commercial-grade electronics, to military end users in China, a term which may include many Chinese commercial companies that sell products to or do business with the military. These and other regulations have reduced our ability to sell our products to customers in China and it is possible future regulation could further reduce demand for our products. As a result of these restrictive measures, certain of our customers have made efforts to source products domestically in order to mitigate perceived risks to their supply chain. If these efforts are successful, are widespread amongst our customers and expand to our products and solutions broadly, overall global demand for our customers products or for other products produced or manufactured in the United States or based on U.S. technology may 
 19 

Table of Contents 

 be reduced, in turn reducing demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, government authorities may take retaliatory actions, impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies, or require the license or other transfer of intellectual property, which could have a significant adverse impact on our business. Such risks may be especially exacerbated as they relate to China, a market that is important to our business, representing approximately 15 of our sales in 2022. 
 
 A significant portion of our sales is concentrated on a limited number of key customers, and our net sales and profitability may materially decline if we were to lose one or more of these customers. 
 
 Sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue, shipments, cash flows, collections and profitability. Our top ten customers accounted for 43 , 43 and 46 of our net sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our customers could stop using our products in their manufacturing processes with limited advance notice to us, and we would have limited or no contractual recourse. The cancellation, reduction or deferral of purchases of our products by any one of these customers could significantly reduce our revenues in any particular quarter. If we were to lose any of our significant customers, if our products are not specified for our significant customers products or if we suffer a material reduction in their purchase orders, our revenue could decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Due to the long design and development cycle and lengthy customer product qualification periods required for most of our products, we may be unable to replace these customers quickly, if at all. In addition, our principal customers hold considerable purchasing power and may be able to negotiate sales terms that result in decreased pricing, increased costs, and/or lower margins for us, and limitations on our ability to share jointly developed technology with others. The semiconductor industry may continue to undergo consolidation, and if any of our customers merge or are acquired, we may experience lower overall sales to the merged or combined companies. 
 
 Our customer base is also geographically concentrated, particularly in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, China and the United States. As a result, export regulations or other trends that apply to customers in certain countries, such as those in China, have exposed and may further expose our business and results of operations to greater volatility. The geographic concentration of our customer base could shift over time as a result of government policy and incentives to develop regional semiconductor industries. 
 
 If we are unable to anticipate and respond to rapid technological change and customer requirements by continuing to innovate and introduce new and enhanced products and solutions, our business could be seriously harmed. 
 
 The semiconductor industry is subject to rapid technological change, changing customer requirements and frequent new product introductions. In our industry, the first company to introduce an innovative product that addresses an identified market need will often have a significant advantage over competing products. For this reason, we make significant expenditures to research, develop, engineer and market new products and make significant capital investments in technology and manufacturing capacity in anticipation of future business and without any purchase commitment from our customers. We incurred 229.0 million, 167.6 million and 136.1 million for engineering, research and development expense in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, to support new product and technology development. In addition, we have been investing significantly in our manufacturing footprint, such as our KSP facility in Taiwan and our newly announced planned facility in Colorado Springs, to meet anticipated demand for our products. Following development, it may take several years for sales of a new product to reach a substantial level of sales, if ever. If a product concept does not progress beyond the development stage or only achieves limited acceptance in the marketplace, we may not receive a direct return on our expenditures, we may lose market share and our revenue and our profitability may decline. For example, in the past, we incurred significant impairment charges for capital expenditures related to developing the capability to manufacture shippers and FOUPs for 450 mm wafers, which major semiconductor manufacturers announced that they would not initiate manufacturing for in the foreseeable future. 
 
 We believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to continue to develop mission-critical solutions to maximize our customers manufacturing yields and enable higher performance semiconductor devices. A failure to successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes by developing, marketing and manufacturing new products or enhancements to our existing products could harm our business prospects and significantly reduce our sales. For example, as 3D NAND technology advances to higher densities, the conventional process used to etch critical features no longer works. Recognizing the need for a new chemistry, we developed a series of prototype formulations for highly selective nitride etch and developed a specialized liquid filter that removes contaminants while simultaneously maintaining the critical components that make the chemistry function. While we have achieved process-of-record for these specific etch processes with certain customers and we are preparing for rapid, high-volume ramp, we may not generate significant revenue from these solutions. We cannot assure you that the new products and technology we choose to develop and market will be successful. In addition, if new products have reliability or quality problems, we may experience reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance and payment, additional service and warranty expense and damage to our reputation.

 Competition from new or existing companies could harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. 
 
 We operate in a highly competitive industry. We face many competitors, some of which have substantially greater manufacturing, financial, research and development and marketing resources than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may have better-established customer relationships than we do, which may enable them to have their products specified for use more frequently and more quickly by these customers. We also face competition from smaller, regional companies that focus on serving customers in their regions. Further, customers continually evaluate the benefits of internal manufacturing versus outsourcing, and a customer s decision to internally manufacture products that we provide may negatively impact us. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, fewer customer orders, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and a loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, we expect that existing and new competitors will improve their products and introduce new products with enhanced performance characteristics. The introduction of new products or more efficient production of existing products by competitors could diminish our market share and increase pricing pressure on our products. 
 
 We may acquire other businesses, form joint ventures or divest businesses, any of which could negatively affect our financial performance. 
 
 We intend to continue to engage in business combinations, acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, divestitures or other types of collaborations to address gaps in our product offerings, adjust our business and product portfolio to meet our ongoing strategic objectives, diversify into complementary markets, increase our scale or accomplish other strategic objectives. These transactions involve numerous risks to our business, financial condition and operating results, including but not limited to: 
 experiencing difficulty in identifying suitable acquisition candidates and completing transactions at appropriate valuations, in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis or at all, due to substantial competition for acquisition targets; 
 inability to successfully integrate any acquired businesses into our business operations; 
 failure to realize the anticipated synergies or other benefits of any such transaction; 
 entering into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience; 
 finding acquirors and obtaining adequate value for businesses that no longer meet our objectives; 
 inability to complete proposed or pending transactions due to factors such as the failure or inability to obtain regulatory or other approvals; 
 requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and restrictions on the conduct of our existing business or the acquired business; 
 undertaking multiple transactions at the same time in order to take advantage of acquisition or divestiture opportunities that do arise, which could strain our ability to effectively execute and integrate such transactions; 
 diversion of management s attention from our day-to-day business due to dedication of significant management resources to such transactions; 
 employee uncertainty and lack of focus during the integration process that may also disrupt our business; 
 the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction; 
 challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and people, potentially located in regions where we have not historically conducted or operated our business; 
 dependence on unfamiliar or less secure supply chains and inefficient scale of the acquired entity; 
 increasing costs of performing due diligence to meet the expectations of investors and government regulators; 
 despite our due diligence, we could assume unknown, underestimated or contingent liabilities, such as potential environmental, health and safety liabilities, any of which could lead to costly litigation or mitigation actions; 
 an acquired technology or product may have inadequate or invalid intellectual property protection or may be subject to claims of infringement by a third party, which may result in claims for damages and lower than anticipated revenue; 
 we could experience negative effects on our reported results of operations from dilutive results from operations and/or from future potential impairment of acquired assets, including goodwill, related to acquisitions; 
 an acquired company may have inadequate or ineffective internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, cybersecurity, privacy, environmental, health and safety, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, human resource or other policies or practices, which may require unexpected or additional integration, mitigation and remediation costs; 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 reductions in cash or increases in debt to finance transactions, which reduce the cash flow available for general corporate or other purposes, including share repurchases and dividends; and 
 difficulties in retaining key employees or customers of an acquired business. 
 
 Manufacturing interruptions or delays, or other disruptions to our operations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our manufacturing processes are complex and require the use of expensive and technologically sophisticated equipment and materials. These processes are frequently modified to improve manufacturing yields, process stability and product quality. We have, on occasion, experienced manufacturing difficulties, such as critical equipment breakdowns or the introduction of impurities in the manufacturing process. Any future difficulties could cause lower yields, make our products unmarketable and/or delay deliveries to customers. In addition, any modification to the manufacturing process of a product could require that the product be re-qualified by customers, which can increase our costs and delay our ability to sell this product to our customers. These and other manufacturing difficulties may result in the loss of sales and exposure to warranty and product liability claims. 
 
 Some of our products are manufactured at only one or two facilities in different countries, many of which are subject to severe weather events and natural catastrophes, such as typhoons in Taiwan, Malaysia and China, earthquakes in Japan and Taiwan, hurricanes in east Texas and Florida, severe winter weather in Texas, wildfires in California and Colorado and flooding in Arkansas. Our suppliers and customers face similar dangers. Our continuity plans designed to mitigate the impact of natural disasters on our operations may be insufficient, and any catastrophe may disrupt our ability to manufacture and deliver products to our customers, resulting in an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. A disruption at our manufacturing facilities could impact sales of the products manufactured at those facilities until another facility could commence or expand production of those products, and disruptions at our other facilities may similarly adversely affect our operations. In addition to natural disasters, disruptions may be caused by other factors, including civil unrest, outbreaks of disease, terrorist actions or other events outside our control. We have moved, and we may again move, the manufacture of certain products from one plant to another. If we fail to transfer and re-establish the manufacturing processes in the destination plant efficiently and effectively, we may not be able to meet customer demand, we may lose credibility with our customers and our business may be harmed. Even if we successfully move our manufacturing processes, we may not achieve the anticipated levels of cost savings or efficiencies, if any. 
 
 Our operations use hazardous materials that expose us to various risks, including potential liability for personal injury and potential remediation obligations. 
 
 Our operations involve, and we are exposed to the risks associated with, the use and manufacture of hazardous materials. In particular, we manufacture specialty chemicals, which is an inherently hazardous process that may result in accidents, and store and transport hazardous raw materials, products and waste in, to and from various facilities. Potential risks that may disrupt our operations or expose us to significant losses and liabilities include explosions and fires, chemical spills and other discharges, releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, and pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures. These and other hazards may result in liability for personal injury, death, damage to property and contamination of the environment; suspension of operations; the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties and other sanctions; cleanup costs; claims by governmental entities or third parties; reputational harm; increases in our insurance costs; and other adverse impacts on our results of operations. Moreover, a failure of one of our products at a customer site could interrupt the business operations of the customer. For example, while we believe that our SDS and VAC delivery systems are safe to transport, store and deliver toxic gases, any leakage could cause serious damage, including injury or death, to any person exposed to those toxic gases, potentially creating significant product liability exposure for us. Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to satisfy any such liabilities, and our financial results or financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 
 Loss of any of our key personnel could harm our business, and our inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could inhibit our ability to operate and grow our business successfully. 
 
 Many of our key personnel have significant experience in the semiconductor industry and deep technical expertise. The loss of the services of any of our key employees or an inability to attract, train and retain qualified and skilled employees, particularly research and development and engineering personnel, could inhibit our ability to operate and grow our business. As the semiconductor industry has grown in recent years, competition for qualified talent, particularly those with significant industry experience, has intensified. During 2022, we experienced, and may in the future continue to experience, an increasingly competitive and constrained labor market, which may limit our ability to add headcount required to meet our customers demand, decrease our productivity due to an influx of inexperienced workers and cause our labor costs to increase and our 
 22 

Table of Contents 

 profitability to decline. As a result, the difficulty and costs associated with attracting and retaining employees has risen and may continue to rise. 
 
 If we fail to obtain, protect and enforce intellectual property rights, our business and prospects could be harmed. 
 
 Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights. We rely on patent, trade secret and trademark laws to protect many of our major product platforms. Although we often file applications for additional patents, our pending applications may not be approved. Moreover, any patents that we own or obtain may not provide us with any competitive advantage, may be designed around and these patents may expire or be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, rendered unenforceable or otherwise compromised by third parties. In addition, any failure to obtain intellectual property protection in the international jurisdictions we serve could expose us to increased competition, which could limit our growth and future revenue. The confidentiality agreements we enter into with our employees and certain third parties to protect our proprietary information and technology may be inadequate to protect our interests, and the remedies available to us for any breach may not adequately mitigate any breach or our confidential and proprietary information and technology may be replicated or obtained through lawful means. Additionally, we may lose trade secret protection as a result of the actions or omissions by us, our employees or third parties. Any weakness in our ability to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Third parties may misappropriate our intellectual property rights, and disputes regarding intellectual property rights may arise. We may bring litigation in order to enforce our patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement. Such litigation could result in substantial costs, diversion of resources, require us to pay damages or royalties, require us to alter our products or processes, or require us to obtain a license, which we may be unable to do on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, to continue selling the impacted product, and could negatively affect our sales, profitability and prospects. From 2015 until 2020, we were party to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights against Gudeng Precision Industrial Co., Ltd. for their patent infringement. We settled this dispute in 2020 by licensing certain of our intellectual property rights to Gudeng. In 2021, Gudeng filed a patent lawsuit against us, and the lawsuit is pending. We are party to ongoing litigation with Dupont relating to claims that certain Dupont products infringe on certain of our CMP slurry patents. W e continue to vigorously defend and enforce our patents and rights, which will cause us to incur costs. We may initiate other costly litigation against our competitors or other third parties in order to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot predict how any existing or future litigation will be resolved or what impact it may have on us. 
 
 We may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and new laws and regulations regarding data privacy may increase our costs. 
 
 We collect and store sensitive data, including our financial information, intellectual property, confidential information, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our employees and others, as well as similar information of our customers, suppliers and business partners. We maintain this information in our data centers, on our networks and on information technology, or IT, systems owned and maintained by third parties. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. All IT systems are subject to disruption, breach or failure. Data breaches, including those sponsored by state actors, have become increasingly common in recent years. For example, during 2020, the United States government was hacked via third-party software applications by hackers suspected of being sponsored by a foreign intelligence agency. We and our third-party suppliers have experienced, and expect to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents ranging from employee error or misuse, to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems, to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats. Despite the precautions we and our third-party providers undertake, IT system failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security could cause disruption in our operations, issues with customer communication and order management, the unauthorized or unintentional disclosure of sensitive information, disruptions in our transaction processing or undermine the integrity of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, which could affect our reputation, result in significant liabilities and expenses, adversely affect our ability to report our financial results in a timely manner and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These risks may be further amplified by the increased reliance on remote access to IT systems by us and our customers, suppliers and other third parties as a result of employees working remotely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
 Moreover, new laws and regulations, such as the European Union s General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act and China s Personal Information Protection Law, add to the complexity of our compliance obligations, 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 which increases our compliance costs. Although we have established internal controls and procedures intended to achieve compliance with such laws and regulations, a failure to fully comply could result in significant penalties. 
 
 Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business. 
 
 There are inherent climate-related risks wherever our business is conducted. Changes in market dynamics, stakeholder expectations, local, national and international climate change policies, and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure in the United States and abroad, all have the potential to disrupt our business and operations. Such events could result in a significant increase in our costs and expenses and harm our future revenue, cash flows and financial performance. Global climate change is resulting in, and may continue to result, in certain natural disasters and adverse weather events, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise and flooding, occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, which could cause business disruptions and impact employees abilities to commute or to work from home effectively. 
 
 Our environmental, social and governance commitments could result in additional costs, and our inability to achieve them could have an adverse impact on our reputation and performance. 
 
 From time to time we communicate our strategies, commitments and targets related to sustainability, carbon emissions, diversity and inclusion, human rights, and other environmental, social and governance matters. These strategies, commitments and targets reflect our current plans and aspirations, and we may be unable to achieve them. Changing customer sustainability requirements, as well as our sustainability targets, could cause us from time to time to alter our manufacturing, operations or products, and incur substantial additional expense to meet such requirements and targets. Any failure to meet these sustainability requirements or targets could adversely impact the demand for our products and subject us to significant costs and liabilities and reputational risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, standards and processes for measuring and reporting carbon emissions and other sustainability metrics may change over time, and may result in inconsistent data, or could result in significant revisions to our strategies, commitments and targets, or our ability to achieve them. Any scrutiny of our carbon emissions or other sustainability disclosures or our failure to achieve related strategies, commitments and targets could negatively impact our reputation or performance. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Acquisition of CMC Materials 
 
 Combining our businesses and those of CMC may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, which may adversely affect our business results and negatively affect the value of our common stock following the acquisition. 
 
 The success of the acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated benefits from integrating CMC into the Company. To realize these anticipated benefits, our businesses and those of CMC must be successfully combined. If we are not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon our revenues, level of expenses and operating results, which may adversely affect the value of our common stock. Moreover, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized. Actual growth and cost savings, if achieved, may be lower than what we expect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated. 
 
 It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of customers, the disruption of either company s or both companies ongoing businesses, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall integration process that take longer than originally anticipated. Specifically, the following issues, among others, must be addressed in integrating our operations and those of CMC in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition: 
 
 combining the companies operations and corporate functions; 
 combining the companies businesses and meeting our capital requirements following the acquisition, in a manner that permits us to achieve any cost savings or revenue synergies anticipated to result from the acquisition, the failure of which would result in the anticipated benefits of the acquisition not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all; 
 integrating personnel from the two companies; 
 24 

Table of Contents 

 integrating the companies technologies; 
 integrating and unifying the offerings and services available to customers; 
 identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming functions and assets; 
 harmonizing the companies operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls and other policies, procedures and processes; 
 maintaining existing agreements with customers, distributors, providers and vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers, distributors, providers and vendors; 
 addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies; 
 consolidating the companies administrative and information technology infrastructure; 
 coordinating distribution and marketing efforts; 
 managing the movement of certain positions to different locations; and 
 coordinating geographically dispersed organizations. 
 
 In addition, at times, the attention of management and our resources may be focused on completion of business integration and diverted from day-to-day business operations or other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us, which may disrupt our ongoing business. 
 
 Risks Related to Government Regulation 
 We are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations that could cause us to incur significant liabilities and expenses. 
 
 Failure to comply with the wide variety of federal, state, local and non-U.S. regulatory requirements relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of, and human exposure to, hazardous chemicals could result in future liabilities or the suspension of production or shipment. These requirements have become stricter over time. These laws and regulations, among others, increase the complexity and costs of transporting our products from the country in which they are manufactured to our customers. Further changes to these and similar regulations could restrict our ability to expand, build or acquire new facilities, require us to acquire costly control equipment, cause us to incur expenses associated with remediation of contamination, cause us to modify our manufacturing or shipping processes or otherwise increase our cost of doing business and have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the potential adoption of new laws, rules or regulations related to climate change poses risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct our businesses. For example, new or modified regulations could require us to make substantial expenditures to enhance our environmental compliance efforts. 
 
 We are exposed to various risks from our regulatory environment. 
 
 We are subject to risks related to new, different, inconsistent, or even conflicting laws, rules, and regulations that may be enacted by legislative or executive bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries where we operate; disagreements or disputes related to international trade; and the interpretation and application of laws, rules, and regulations. As a public company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, including those related to health and safety, export controls, financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, anti-corruption, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials or customers, conflict minerals or other social responsibility legislation, employment practices, immigration or travel regulations and antitrust regulations, among others. Each of these laws, rules and regulations imposes costs on our business, including financial costs and potential diversion of our management s attention, and may present risks to our business, including potential fines, restrictions on our actions and reputational damage if we do not fully comply. The volume of changes to such laws, rules and regulations may increase in the United States over the next several quarters as the Biden administration continues to implement its policies. 
 
 To maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, we intend to invest in appropriate resources to comply with evolving standards. Changes in or ambiguous interpretations of laws, regulations and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. Efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased administrative expenses and diversion of management s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with laws and regulations, our reputation, business, financial condition and/or results of operations could be adversely affected, we may 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 be disqualified or barred from participating in certain activities and we may be forced to modify our operations to achieve full compliance. 
 
 Changes in taxation or adverse tax rulings could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 We operate in many foreign countries and are subject to taxation at various rates and audit by multiple taxing authorities. Our results of operations could be affected by tax audits, changes in tax rates, changes in laws and regulations governing the calculation, location and taxation of earned profit, changes in laws and regulations affecting our ability to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet and changes in laws and regulations relating to the repatriation of cash into the United States. Each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year in each tax jurisdiction. If our performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax liability would also likely change, perhaps materially. 
 
 We have undertaken and expect to continue to undertake a number of complex internal reorganizations of our foreign subsidiaries in order to rationalize and streamline our foreign operations, focus our management efforts on certain local opportunities and take advantage of favorable business conditions in certain localities. These or any future reorganizations could result in adverse tax consequences in one or more jurisdictions, which could adversely impact our profitability from foreign operations and result in a material reduction in our results of operations. 
 
 Various other jurisdictions, including members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are considering changes to their tax laws, including provisions intended to address base erosion and profit shifting by taxpayers. Any tax reform adopted in these or other countries may exacerbate the risks described above. 
 Risks R elated to Our Indebtedness 
 We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and may in the future incur substantially more debt, each of which could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing in the future and react to changes in our business. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had an aggregate principal amount of 5.9 billion of indebtedness outstanding, including the 2,495 million from our senior secured term loan facility due 2029, or the Term Loan Facility, 1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of the 4.75 senior secured notes due April 15, 2029, 895 million aggregate principal amount of the 5.95 senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2030, our 4.375 senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2028, our 3.625 senior unsecured notes due May 1, 2029, or collectively the Notes, and our bridge credit facility due 2023, or the Bridge Credit Facility. In addition, we have approximately 575 million of unutilized capacity under our senior secured revolving credit facility due 2027, or the Revolving Facility. We refer to the Term Loan Facility, and the Revolving Facility as the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Bridge Credit Facility as the Credit Facilities and the credit agreements that govern the Credit Facilities as the Credit Agreements. Further, we may incur significant additional secured and unsecured indebtedness in the future. 
 
 Although the indentures governing the Notes, or the Indentures, and the Credit Agreements restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, the restrictions have a number of significant qualifications and exceptions. For example, the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, or the Amended Credit Agreement, provides that we can request additional loans and commitments up to the greater of 1,100 million or 100 of our EBITDA, as well as additional amounts if our secured net leverage ratio is less than a specified ratio. Further, these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring monetary obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. If we add new indebtedness and other monetary obligations to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face would intensify. 
 
 Our debt could have important consequences, including: 
 limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; 
 requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes; 
 increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions; 
 exposing us to increased interest expense for borrowings with variable interest rates, including borrowings under the Credit Facilities; and 
 placing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors or competitors with comparable debt having more favorable terms. 
 
 We may be unable to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions, which may not be successful, to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness. 
 26 

Table of Contents 

We may be unable to maintain sufficient cash flow from operating activities to permit us to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance and the condition of the capital markets, which are subject to prevailing economic, industry and competitive conditions, as well as many financial, business, legislative, political, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems, be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, the level and quality of our earnings, operations, business and management, among other things, will impact the determination of our credit ratings. A decrease in the ratings assigned to us by the ratings agencies may negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase our cost of borrowing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any future required financing on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the current credit worthiness or prospective credit rating of the Company. Any actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in such credit rating may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position or access to capital markets. 
 
 Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. We may not be able to implement any refinancing on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, a refinancing may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The agreements governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds of such dispositions, and we may be unable to consummate any dispositions or generate proceeds sufficient to meet our debt service obligations. 
 
 If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, holders of the Notes and lenders under the Credit Facilities could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the Revolving Facility could terminate their commitments to advance further loans, our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. 
 
 The terms of the Credit Agreements and the Indentures may restrict our operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or raise additional funds. 
 
 The Amended Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions that may limit our and our restricted subsidiaries ability to take actions that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries ability to: 
 incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; 
 pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, capital stock; 
 prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt; 
 make investments, loans, advances and acquisitions; 
 engage in sale-leaseback or hedging transactions; 
 create liens on, sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries; 
 enter into transactions with affiliates; 
 enter into agreements that restrict the ability to create liens, pay dividends or make loan repayments; 
 alter the businesses we conduct; and 
 merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets or incur a change of control in our capital stock ownership. 
 
 Also, the Indentures and the credit agreement governing our Bridge Credit Facility contain limited covenants, such as a 
 covenant restricting our ability and certain of our subsidiaries ability to incur certain debt secured by liens, engage in 
 sale-leaseback and incur additional indebtedness by any restricted subsidiary. 
 
 In addition, the restrictive covenants under the credit agreement governing the Revolving Facility may, depending on the amount of revolving borrowings, unreimbursed letter of credit drawings and undrawn letters of credit, require us to maintain a secured net leverage ratio, which we may be unable to meet. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in the acceleration of some or all of our indebtedness, which could lead to bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency. 
 Risks Related to Owning our Common Stock 
 The price of our common stock has been and may remain volatile. 
 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 The price of our common stock has been volatile. In 2022, the closing price of our stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, or Nasdaq, ranged from a low of 62.71 to a high of 140.83, and, as in past years, the price of our common stock may show even greater volatility in the future. The trading price of our common stock is subject to significant volatility in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control or may be unrelated to our operating results, including the following: 
 the significant increase in volatility in the stock market as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; 
 any changes to our financial guidance, as well as potential decreased confidence in any guidance we do provide; 
 changes in global economic conditions, including those resulting from trade tensions, rising inflation, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates; 
 the failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts, which may vary significantly from our actual results; 
 changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; 
 press releases or announcements by, or changes in market values of, comparable companies; 
 high volatility in price and volume in the markets for high-technology stocks; 
 the public perception of equity values of publicly traded companies; 
 fluctuations in our results of operations; and 
 the other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC. 
 
 Fluctuations in our results of operations could cause our stock price to decline significantly. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as indicators of our future performance. Future decreases in our stock price may adversely impact our ability to raise sufficient additional capital in the future, if needed. 
 
 There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or that we will recommence the repurchase of our shares in any particular amounts or at all. 
 
 Future payments of quarterly dividends and any future repurchases of shares of our common stock are subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that they are in the best interest of our stockholders and comply with all laws and applicable agreements. Future dividends and any future share repurchases may be affected by, among other factors, potential capital requirements for acquisitions and the funding of our research and development activities; legal risks; changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws; contractual restrictions, such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements; availability of domestic cash flow; and changes to our business model. The amounts of our dividend payments may change from time to time, and we may decide at any time to reduce, suspend or discontinue the payment of dividends or the repurchase of shares. A reduction, suspension or discontinuation of our dividend payments or the cessation of our share repurchase program could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and may harm our reputation. 
 
 Provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of us, which could decrease the value of our shares. 
 
 Our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include limitations on actions by written consent of our stockholders. 
 
 Our certificate of incorporation makes us subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits publicly held Delaware corporations from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. This provision could discourage parties from bidding for our shares of common stock and could, as a result, reduce the likelihood of an increase in the price of our common stock that would otherwise occur if a bidder sought to buy our common stock. 
 
 Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue, without further stockholder approval, up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix and designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights and liquidation preferences. The holders of any shares of preferred stock could have preferences over the holders of our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights. Any issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control. Any issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock and could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of decreasing the market price of our common stock.

Leases for our facilities expire through October 2031. We currently expect to be able to extend the terms of expiring leases or to find suitable replacement facilities on reasonable terms. We believe that our facilities are well-maintained and suitable for their respective operations. We regularly assess the size, capability and location of our global infrastructure and periodically make adjustments based on these assessments. 
 
 Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are involved in certain legal actions. The outcomes of these legal actions are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues. We record a liability for these legal actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. There is judgment required in the determination of the likelihood of outcome, and if necessary determination of the estimate or range of potential outcomes. Based on the current information, the Company does not believe any known matters have a reasonable possibility of a material amount for litigation or other contingencies related to legal proceedings.

 Overview 
 This overview is not a complete discussion of the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations; it is intended merely to facilitate an understanding of the most salient aspects of its financial condition and operating performance and to provide a context for the detailed discussion and analysis that follows, and must be read in its entirety in order to fully understand the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 The Company is a leading supplier of advanced materials and process solutions for the semiconductor and other high-technology industries. We help our customers maximize manufacturing yields, reduce manufacturing costs and enable higher device performance by leveraging our unique breadth of capabilities to provide mission critical enhanced materials and process solutions for the most advanced manufacturing environments. 
 
 Our business is organized and operated in four operating segments, which align with the key elements of the advanced semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem. 
 The Specialty Chemicals and Engineered Materials segment, or SCEM, provides high-performance and high-purity process chemistries, gases and materials, and safe and efficient materials delivery systems to support semiconductor and other advanced manufacturing processes. 
 The Advanced Planarization Solutions segment, or APS, provides complementary chemical mechanical planarization solutions, advanced materials and high-purity wet chemicals; including CMP slurries, pads, formulated cleans and other electronic chemicals. 
 The Microcontamination Control segment, or MC, offers solutions to filter and purify critical liquid and gaseous chemistries used in semiconductor manufacturing processes and other high-technology industries. 
 The Advanced Materials Handling segment, or AMH, develops solutions to monitor, protect, transport and deliver critical liquid chemistries, wafers and other substrates for a broad set of applications in the semiconductor industry, life sciences and other high-technology industries. 
 
 These segments share common business systems and processes, technology centers and technology roadmaps. With the complementary capabilities across these segments, we believe we are uniquely positioned to create new, co-optimized and increasingly integrated solutions for our customers. For example, after the acquisition of CMC Materials, we now offer an end-to-end offering for our customers consisting of advanced deposition materials from our SCEM segment, CMP slurries, pads and post-CMP cleaning chemistries from our APS segment, CMP slurry filters from our MC segment, and CMP slurry high-purity packaging and fluid monitoring systems from our AMH segment. 
 Impact of New Export Control Regulations 
 On October 7, 2022, the U.S Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security BIS announced new export control regulations that restrict the sale of certain products and services to some companies and domestic fabs in China. Since these rules were published, we have assembled a global, cross-functional team to interpret the regulations, analyze how they may impact Entegris and determine how to best serve our customers going forward in compliance with these rules. These new rules restrict the sale of products and the provision of service to domestic fabs in China operating at or above certain advanced technology nodes. We currently estimate that the new regulations will reduce our net sales by approximately 20 million per quarter in 2023. We int end to apply for export licenses where appropriate. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information regarding risk associated with the impact of new export control regulations, including under the caption The impact of tariffs, export controls and other trade laws and restrictions, especially with respect to China . 
 Impact of COVID-19 on our Business 
 The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the global economy. Infection rates vary across the countries in which we operate, and governmental authorities have continued to implement numerous and constantly evolving measures to try to contain the virus. Continuing impacts of the pandemic include a more challenging supply chain and global logistics environment. While we have experienced instances of raw material constraints, higher freight costs and delivery delays in both inbound shipments of raw materials and outgoing shipments of finished products to customers, we have not experienced material adverse impacts to our global operations. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information regarding risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including under the caption The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Impact of Conflict Between Russia and Ukraine 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 The military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the sanctions imposed by the United States and other governments in response to this conflict have caused significant volatility and disruptions to global markets. We source certain materials from Russia and Ukraine, and we have been able to obtain an adequate supply of these materials to serve our customers, albeit at increased cost. We are proactively assessing and evaluating alternative sources to bolster our supply of these materials moving forward, in addition to working closely with our customers on any product re-qualification that may be required. Revenue relating to products manufactured from raw materials sourced from this region does not constitute a material portion of our business and historically, we have not received significant revenue from this region. The ultimate impact of the conflict on the global economy, supply chains, logistics, fuel prices, raw material pricing and our business remains uncertain. We cannot currently predict the ultimate impact of the conflict on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information regarding risk associated with the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, including under the caption Risks Related to Our Business and Industry . 
 Recent Events

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. At each balance sheet date, management evaluates its estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment, and identified intangible assets), goodwill and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management s utilization of different judgments or estimates could result in material differences in the amount and timing of the Company s results of operations for any period. In addition, actual results could be different from the Company s current estimates, possibly resulting in increased future charges to earnings.

Table of Contents 

 Our critical accounting policies that are most significantly affected by estimates, assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements relate to business acquisitions and are discussed below. See Note 1 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional information about the Company s other significant accounting policies. 
 Business Acquisitions 
 The Company accounts for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact net income. Accordingly, for significant items the Company typically obtains assistance from a third-party valuation firm. 
 There are several methods that can be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. For intangible assets, the Company normally utilizes the income method, which starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows attributable to the subject intangible asset. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Depending on the asset valued, the key assumptions included one or more of the following: (1) future revenue growth rates, (2) future gross margin, (3) future selling, general and administrative expenses, (4) royalty rates, and (5) discount rates. 
 Estimating the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. For example, different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives, influenced by the nature of the asset, competitive environment, and rate of change in the industry. Certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. All of these judgments and estimates can significantly impact the determination of the amortization period of the intangible asset, and thus net income. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Year ended December 31, 2022 compared to year ended December 31, 2021 
 The following table sets forth the results of operations and the relationship between various components of operations, stated as a percent of net sales, for 2022 and 2021. (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 of net sales of net sales Net sales 3,282,033 100.0 2,298,893 100.0 Cost of sales 1,885,620 57.5 1,239,229 53.9 Gross profit 1,396,413 42.5 1,059,664 46.1 Selling, general and administrative expenses 543,485 16.6 292,408 12.7 Engineering, research and development expenses 228,994 7.0 167,632 7.3 Amortization of intangible assets 143,953 4.4 47,856 2.1 Operating income 479,981 14.6 551,768 24.0 Interest expense 212,669 6.5 41,240 1.8 Interest income (3,694) (0.1) (243) Other expense, net 23,926 0.7 31,695 1.4 Income before income taxes 247,080 7.5 479,076 20.8 Income tax expense 38,160 1.2 69,950 3.0 Net income 208,920 6.4 409,126 17.8 
 Net sales For 2022, net sales were 3,282.0 million, up 983.1 million, or 43 , from 2021. An analysis of the factors underlying the increase in net sales is presented in the following table: (In thousands) Net sales in 2021 
 2,298,893 Increase mainly associated with volume exclusive of acquired businesses 594,407 Increase associated with acquired businesses 495,591 Decrease associated with effect of foreign currency translation (106,858) Net sales in 2022 
 3,282,033 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 Total net sales increased primarily driven by the inclusion of sales from the acquisition of CMC Materials for the six-month period subsequent to the Closing Date. Growth was also driven in our unit driven solutions, including liquid filtration, selective etch, gas purification systems and advanced deposition materials, which are of growing importance to our customers technology. Total net sales also reflected unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of 106.9 million, mainly due to the significant weakening of the Japanese yen and the Korean won relative to the U.S. dollar. 
 Sales percentage on a geographic basis for 2022 and 2021 and the percentage increase in sales for 2022 compared to sales for 2021 were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Percentage increase in sales North America 24 23 51 Taiwan 20 20 45 China 15 16 38 South Korea 13 14 31 Japan 11 13 16 Europe 10 9 55 Southeast Asia 7 5 88 
 The increase in sales for all geographic areas was primarily driven by the inclusion of sales from the CMC Materials acquisition and a general increase in demand for products. 
 Gross margin 
 The following table sets forth gross margin as a percentage of net revenues: 
 2022 2021 Percentage point change Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues: 42.5 46.1 -3.6 
 Gross margin decreased by 3.6 percentage points for 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to a 61.9 million charge or 1.9 percentage point change for fair value write-up of acquired CMC Materials inventory sold during the three-month period subsequent to the CMC Materials acquisition, and the inclusion of CMC Materials products, which have aggregate lower gross margins. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for the sales and administrative staff, professional fees (including accounting, legal and technology costs and expenses), and sales and marketing costs. SG A expenses for 2022 increased 251.1 million, or 86 , to 543.5 million from 292.4 million in 2021. 
 An analysis of the factors underlying the increase in SG A expenses is presented in the following table: (In thousands) Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2021 
 292,408 SG A expense recorded by CMC Materials and included in Company s financial statements after the date of the acquisition 68,249 Employee costs, exclusive of CMC Materials 12,533 Deal and transaction costs 34,799 Integration costs 46,951 Contractual and non-cash integration costs 61,964 Professional costs, exclusive of CMC Materials 7,734 Travel costs, exclusive of CMC Materials 4,029 Other increases, net 14,818 Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2022 
 543,485 
 Engineering, research and development expenses 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 Engineering, research and development expenses consist of expenses for the support of current product lines and the development of new products and manufacturing technologies. These expenses were 229.0 million in 2022 and 167.6 million in 2021. 
 An analysis of the factors underlying the increase in ER D expenses is presented in the following table: (In thousands) Engineering, research and development expense in 2021 
 167,632 ER D expense recorded by CMC Materials and included in Company s financial statements after the date of the acquisition 25,993 Employee costs, exclusive of CMC Materials 18,419 Project related costs, exclusive of CMC Materials 10,734 Other increases, net 6,216 Engineering, research and development expense in 2022 
 228,994 
 The Company s overall ER D efforts will continue to focus on developing and improving its technology platforms for semiconductor and advanced processing applications and identifying and developing products for new applications, and the Company often works directly with its customers to address their particular needs. As a percentage of revenue, the Company expects to increase ER D expenses in the coming years. 
 Amortization of intangible assets Amortization of intangible assets was 144.0 million in 2022 compared to 47.9 million for 2021. The increase primarily reflects additional amortization expense associated with the recent acquisition of CMC Materials. 
 Interest expense Interest expense was 212.7 million in 2022 and 41.2 million in 2021. Interest expense includes interest associated with debt outstanding and the amortization of debt issuance costs associated with such borrowings. The increase primarily reflects higher interest expense related to the debt financing of the CMC Materials acquisition. 
 Interest income Interest income was 3.7 million in 2022 and 0.2 million in 2021. The increase reflects rising average interest rates and cash balances. 
 Other expense, net Other expense, net, was 23.9 million in 2022 compared to 31.7 million in 2021. 
 In 2022, other expense, net consisted mainly of consisted mainly of foreign currency transaction losses of 23.0 million. 
 In 2021, other expense, net consisted mainly of a loss on extinguishment of debt of 23.1 million associated with the redemption of the Company s 550 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2026 and foreign currency transaction losses of 7.9 million. 
 Income tax expense The Company recorded income tax expense of 38.2 million in 2022 compared to income tax expense of 70.0 million in 2021. The Company s effective tax rate was 15.4 in 2022 compared to an effective tax rate of 14.6 in 2021. 
 The increase in the effective tax rate from 2021 to 2022 primarily relates to a reduction in creditable foreign withholding taxes during the year. This was partially offset by certain acquisition related expenses that were recorded during the year and a change in income geographic mix. Additionally, the tax rate for 2021 included the reversal of a valuation allowance on foreign tax credits generated during 2020 of 6.2 million and the recognition of a capital loss tax benefit of 5.1 million. These tax benefits were offset in part by tax recorded on the sale of intangible property of 3.5 million in 2021. The income tax expense for 2022 and 2021 includes discrete benefits of 4.0 million and 13.8 million, respectively, recorded in connection with share-based compensation. 
 Net income Net income was 208.9 million, or 1.46 per diluted share, in 2022 compared to net income of 409.1 million, or 3.00 per diluted share, in 2021. The decrease reflects the Company s aforementioned operating results described in greater detail above and an increase of 12.9 million shares of common stock issued in connection with the CMC Materials acquisition that increased the number of dilutive shares outstanding. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures Information The Company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Company also utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures as a complement to financial measures provided in accordance with GAAP in order to better assess and reflect trends affecting the Company s business and results of operations. See Non-GAAP Information included below in this section for additional detail, including the reconciliation of the Company s non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 
 The Company s non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income, together with related percentage changes, and non-GAAP earnings per share, or EPS. 
 Adjusted EBITDA increased to 973.2 million in 2022, compared to 699.4 million in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of net sales was 29.7 in 2022 compared to 30.4 in 2021. Adjusted operating income increased 37.6 to 837.9 million in

 2022, compared to 609.1 million in 2021. Adjusted operating income as a percent of net sales was 25.5 in 2022 compared to 26.5 in 2021. Non-GAAP EPS increased 8.4 to 3.73 in 2022, compared to 3.44 in 2021. The decreases in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income as a percentage net sales reflects lower gross margin. 
 
 Segment Analysis 
 Effective July 6, 2022, coincident to and in conjunction with the CMC acquisition (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements) the Company changed its financial segment reporting to reflect management and organizational changes made by the Company. The Company reports its financial performance based on four reportable segments: Specialty Chemicals and Engineered Materials, Microcontamination Control, Advanced Material Handling and Advanced Planarization Solutions. The change which included a transfer of some related operations in our Specialty Chemicals and Engineered Materials reportable segment to our Advanced Planarization Solutions reportable segment. Accordingly, our segment information was restated retroactively in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The segment realignment had no impact on the Microcontamination Control or Advanced Materials Handling segments. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Company s four segments. The following is a discussion of the results of operations of these four business segments. 
 The following table and discussion concern the results of operations of the Company s four reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. (In thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Specialty Chemicals and Engineered Materials 
 Net sales 773,594 625,670 530,040 Segment profit 122,287 137,392 99,474 Microcontamination Control 
 Net sales 1,105,996 919,363 742,186 Segment profit 411,475 321,300 248,910 Advanced Materials Handling 
 Net sales 846,492 704,946 538,682 Segment profit 183,738 159,995 111,028 Advanced Planarization Solutions 
 Net sales 606,614 85,621 79,492 Segment profit 96,902 30,415 28,495 Unallocated general and administrative expenses 190,468 49,478 39,370 
 Specialty Chemicals and Engineered Materials (SCEM) 
 For 2022, SCEM net sales increased to 773.6 million, up 24 from 625.7 million in 2021. The sales increase primarily reflects the inclusion of sales of 90.1 million from inclusion of certain product lines from the acquisition of CMC Materials, while the remainder reflects modestly improved sales of advanced deposition materials, formulated cleans, selective etch and specialty coatings products. 
 SCEM reported a segment profit of 122.3 million for 2022, down 11 compared to 137.4 million in 2021. The decrease in SCEM s profit in 2022 was primarily due unfavorable product mix, the absence of a gain on a sale of non-core intangibles and higher operating expenses of 31 mainly due to the expenses incurred by the inclusion of certain product lines of CMC Materials and a 5.1 million charge for a fair value write-up of acquired CMC Materials inventory sold, partially offset by higher sales. 
 For 2021, SCEM net sales increased to 625.7 million, up 18 from 530.0 million in 2020. The sales increase was mainly due to increased sales of specialty gases and advanced deposition materials, formulated cleaning chemistries and advanced coatings products. 
 SCEM reported a segment profit of 137.4 million for 2021, up 38 compared to 99.5 million in 2020. The increase in SCEM s profit in 2022 was primarily due to higher sales and a gain on a sale of non-core intangibles. 
 Microcontamination Control (MC) 
 For 2022, MC net sales increased to 1,106.0 million, up 20 from 919.4 million in 2021. The sales increase was due to improved performance across substantially all platforms, with growth especially strong in liquid filtration and gas filtration products.

 MC reported a segment profit of 411.5 million for 2022, up 28 compared to 321.3 million in 2021. The increase in MC s profit in 2022 was primarily due to higher gross profit related to the increased sales volume, partially offset by higher operating expenses of 17 , primarily due to higher compensation costs. 
 For 2021, MC net sales increased to 919.4 million, up 24 from 742.2 million in 2020. The sales increase was due to improved performance across substantially all platforms, with growth especially strong in liquid filtration and gas filtration products. 
 MC reported a segment profit of 321.3 million for 2021, up 29 compared to 248.9 million in 2020. The increase in MC s profit in 2021 was primarily due to higher gross profit related to the increased sales volume, partially offset by higher operating expenses of 13 , primarily due to higher compensation costs. 
 Advanced Materials Handling (AMH) 
 For 2022, AMH net sales increased 20 to 846.5 million from 704.9 million in 2021. The sales increase was mainly due to improved sales from wafer handling and fluid handling. 
 AMH reported a segment profit of 183.7 million for 2022, up 15 compared to 160.0 million in 2021. The increase in AMH s profit in 2022 was primarily due to higher sales volume, partially offset by a 16 increase in operating expenses, primarily due to higher compensation costs. 
 For 2021, AMH net sales increased 31 to 704.9 million from 538.7 million in 2020. The sales increase was mainly due to improved sales from wafer handling, fluid handling and measurement products and sales of our Aramus high purity bags, as well as additional sales of 6.8 million attributable to the acquisition of Global Measurement Technologies, Inc. and its manufacturing partner Clean Room Plastics, Inc., which are referred to collectively herein as GMTI. 
 AMH reported a segment profit of 160.0 million for 2021, up 44 compared to 111.0 million in 2020. The increase in AMH s profit in 2021 was primarily due to higher sales volume, favorable product mix, partially offset by a 16 increase in operating expenses, primarily due to higher compensation costs. 
 Advanced Planarization Solutions (APS) 
 For 2022, APS net sales increased 608 to 606.6 million from 85.6 million in 2021. The sales increase was mainly due to sales attributed to the CMC Materials acquisition. 
 APS reported a segment profit of 96.9 million for 2022, up 219 compared to 30.4 million in 2021. The segment profit increase was primarily due to the segment profit attributed to the CMC Materials acquisition, partially offset by a 56.8 million charge for a fair value write-up of acquired CMC Materials inventory sold. 
 For 2021, APS net sales increased 8 to 85.6 million from 79.5 million in 2020. The sales increase was mainly due to improved sales from CMP cleans products, as well as additional sales of 1.2 million attributable to the acquisition of BASF s Precision Microchemicals business in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
 APS reported a segment profit of 30.4 million for 2021, up 7 compared to 28.5 million in 2020. The increase in APS s profit in 2022 was primarily due to higher sales volume. 
 Unallocated general and administrative expenses 
 Unallocated general and administrative expenses for 2022 totaled 190.5 million compared to 49.5 million for 2021. The 141.0 million increase mainly reflects the increase of 106.2 million and 34.8 million in integration related and deal and transaction costs, respectively, related to the acquisition of CMC Materials. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We consider the following when assessing our liquidity and capital resources: In thousands December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 563,439 402,565 Working capital 1,573,254 934,369 Total debt 5,784,893 937,027 
 The Company has historically financed its operations and capital requirements through cash flow from its operating activities, long-term loans, lease financing and borrowings under domestic and international short-term lines of credit. On April 14, 2022, the Company, via a wholly-owned escrow subsidiary, completed a private offering of 1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes. On June 30, 2022, the Company, via a wholly-owned escrow subsidiary, completed a private offering of 0.9 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2030 Notes. In connection with the acquisition of CMC Materials on the Closing Date, the Company borrowed 2.495 billion under the Initial Term Loan Facility and increased commitments by 175.0 million 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 under the Revolving Facility (from 400.0 million to 575.0 million). The Company used a portion of the proceeds of the offering to repay the remaining principal amount of the 145.0 million senior secured term loan facility due 2025. In addition, on the Closing Date, the Company entered into a 364-Day Bridge Credit Agreement and borrowed 275 million aggregate principal amount with a pricing of SOFR plus 4.55 . During the year, the Company made 140.0 million principal payments on the Bridge Credit Facility. 
 Based on our analysis, we believe our existing balances of domestic cash and cash equivalents and our currently anticipated operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our cash needs arising in the ordinary course of business for the next twelve months and for the longer term. 
 We may seek to take advantage of opportunities to raise additional capital through additional debt financing or through public or private sales of securities. If in the future our available liquidity is not sufficient to meet the Company s operating and debt service obligations as they come due, management would need to pursue alternative arrangements through additional equity or debt financing in order to meet the Company s cash requirements. There can be no assurance that any such financing would be available on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. In 2022, we did not experience difficulty accessing capital and credit markets, but future volatility in the capital and credit markets may increase costs associated with issuing debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. In addition, it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets could be limited at a time when we would like, or need, to do so, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to refinance maturing debt and/or react to changing economic and business conditions. 
 
 In summary, our cash flows for each period were as follows: 
 (in thousands) 
 Year ended December 31, 2022 Year ended December 31, 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities 352,283 400,454 Net cash used in investing activities (4,945,709) (298,118) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 4,766,203 (276,497) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 160,874 (178,328) 
 Operating activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. 
 Compared to 2021, the 48.2 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2022 was primarily driven by a 41.6 million of changes in operating assets and liabilities and a 6.5 million decrease of net income adjusted for non-cash reconciling items. 
 Changes in working capital for 2022 were driven by higher inventory and lower accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by lower income taxes payables and lower trade accounts receivable. The change for inventory is due to an increase in raw material purchases to mitigate potential supply chain issues related to COVID-19 and increased business activity. The change for accounts payable and accrued liabilities was driven by timing of payments. The change for taxes was primarily driven by higher tax provision compared to the prior year. The change for trade accounts receivables and notes receivables was primarily due a lower increase in sales compared to that of the comparable previous period. 
 Investing activities 
 I nvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, cash used for acquisitions and proceeds from sales of property and equipment. 
 The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to higher cash paid for acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and for acquisitions. 
 Acquisition of property and equipment totaled 466.2 million in 2022, which primarily reflected investments in facilities, equipment and tooling, compared to 210.6 million in 2021, which also primarily reflected investments in equipment and tooling. Capital expenditures in 2022 generally reflected more spending related to growth capacity investments and the investment in our previously announced investment in our new facility in Taiwan. 
 In 2022, the Company acquired CMC Materials. The cash used to acquire these assets was 4,474.9 million, net of cash acquired. The transaction is described in further detail in Note 3 to the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 In 2021, the Company acquired BASF s Precision Microchemicals business and certain assets of another company in an immaterial transaction. The cash used to acquire these assets was 91.9 million, net of cash acquired. The transactions are described in further detail in Note 3 to the Company s consolidated financial statements.

 Financing activities 
 Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans. 
 In 2022, there was 4,766.2 million of cash provided by financing activities compared to 276.5 million cash used in financing activities in 2021. The change was primarily due to the net debt activity, which was a source of cash of 4.8 billion in 2022 compared to a use of cash of 174.1 million, and the absence of 67.1 million of repurchase and retirement of common stock. See Note 10 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the debt financing that occurred during the year. In anticipation of its acquisition of CMC Materials, the Company suspended its previously announced share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2021 and did not authorize a new repurchase program or resume a repurchase program in 2022. 
 The Company s total dividend payments were 57.3 million in 2022 compared to 43.5 million in 2021. The Company has paid a cash dividend in each quarter since the fourth quarter of 2017. On January 18, 2023, the Company s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.10 per share to be paid on February 22, 2023 to shareholders of record as of February 1, 2023.

 In connection with the acquisition of CMC Materials, the Company obtained the following financing: On the Closing Date, the Company entered into a Term Loan B Facility of 2.495 billion with a pricing at SOFR plus 3.00 . The Company previously syndicated the Initial Term Loan Facility on March 2, 2022 and incurred ticking fees through the Closing Date. The Company used a portion of the proceeds of the offering to repay the remaining principal amount of the 145.0 million senior secured term loan facility due 2025. During the year, the Company incurred 12.0 million in ticking fees, which were recorded to interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations. On the Closing Date, the Company entered into a 275 million senior unsecured Bridge Credit Facility with a pricing of SOFR plus 4.55 . The Company made 140.0 million of principal payments on the Bridge Credit Facility during 2022. On June 30, 2022, the Company issued, via a wholly-owned escrow subsidiary, 895 million aggregate principal amount of the 2030 Notes. On April 14, 2022, the Company also issued, via a wholly-owned escrow subsidiary, 1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes. 
 The Company increased the commitments under the Revolving Facility by 175.0 million (from 400.0 million to 575.0 million) in connection with the closing of the acquisition of CMC Materials on the Closing Date. The Revolving Facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company s option, either a base rate (such as prime rate) or SOFR, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. During the year, the Company borrowed and repaid 201.0 million under the Revolving Facility. At December 31, 2022, there was no balance outstanding under the Revolving Facility and we had undrawn outstanding letters of credit of 1.5 million. 
 
 On July 28, 2022, the Company entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement to hedge the variability in SOFR based interest payments associated with 1.95 billion of its 2.495 billion Initial Term Loan Facility. The notional amount is scheduled to decrease quarterly and will expire on December 30, 2025. 
 
 Through December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all applicable financial covenants included in the terms of its debt arrangements.

 Our cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of three months or less, which are valued at cost and approximate fair value. We utilize a variety of funding strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. 
 Our restricted cash represents cash held in a Rabbi trust and is not available for general corporate purposes. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 Cash requirements 
 We have cash requirements to support working capital needs, capital expenditures, business acquisitions, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. We generally intend to use available cash and funds generated from our operations to meet these cash requirements, but in the event that additional liquidity is required we may also borrow under our Revolving Facility. 
 The following table summarizes our short and long-term cash requirements as of December 31, 2022: 
 (In thousands) Total Due within one year of December 31, 2022 Due later than one year from December 31, 2022 Long-term debt 5,925,000 153,713 5,771,287 Interest payments on long-term debt 2,080,742 323,177 1,757,565 Capital purchase obligations 252,333 191,571 60,762 Supply purchase obligations 12,775 8,765 4,010 Operating leases 117,296 22,817 94,479 Income tax liabilities 489,249 98,057 391,192 Total 8,877,395 798,100 8,079,295 
 Long-term debt and interest payments on long-term debt . We have contractual obligations for principal and interest payments on our long-term debt. See Note 10 of the consolidated financials for additional information. Debt obligations are classified based on their stated maturity date, regardless of their classification on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. Interest projections on both variable and fixed rate long-term debt are based on interest rates effective as of December 31, 2022 and do not include 140.1 million for net unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs. On July 28, 2022, the Company entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement to hedge the variability in SOFR-based interest payments associated with 1.95 billion of its 2.495 billion Initial Term Loan Facility. The notional amount is scheduled to decrease quarterly and will expire on December 30, 2025. The impact of the interest rate swap is not considered in the interest payments above. 
 Capital purchase obligations . We have capital purchase obligations that represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on the Company s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, as the Company had not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property. 
 We expect capital expenditure spending to be approximately 500.0 million in 2023 for growth capacity investments and the construction of our new manufacturing facilities in Taiwan and Colorado. 
 
 Supply purchase obligations . We have non-cancelable commitments, including take-or-pay contracts, that are not presented as capital purchase commitments above. They were not recorded as liabilities on the Company s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, as the Company had not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property. 
 Operating lease commitments . Commitments under operating leases primarily relate to leasehold properties. See Note 14 of the consolidated financials for additional information.

 Income tax liabilities . Of the tax liabilities included in the table above, 53.5 million relates to uncertain tax positions. We are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. However, it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to a tax audit settlement or some other unforeseeable event. See Note 16 of the consolidated financials for additional information. 
 
 New Accounting Pronouncements 
 Recently adopted accounting pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of accounting pronouncements implemented in 2022. Other than the adoption of ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805) and ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832), there were no recently issued accounting pronouncements adopted in 2022. 
 Recently issued accounting pronouncements Refer to Note 1 of the Company s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet adopted. 
 
 Non-GAAP Information The Company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP. 
 The Company also utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures as a complement to financial measures provided in accordance with GAAP in order to better assess and reflect trends affecting the Company s business and results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income, together with related measures thereof, and non-GAAP earnings per share, as well as certain other supplemental non-GAAP financial measures included in the discussion of the Company s financial results. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined by the Company as net income before (1) income tax expense, (2) interest expense, (3) interest income, (4) other expense (income), net, (5) charge for fair value write-up of acquired inventory sold, (6) deal and transaction costs, (7) integration costs, (8) contractual and non-cash integration costs (9) severance and restructuring costs, (10) gain on sale of subsidiary, (11) amortization of intangible assets and (12) depreciation. Adjusted operating income is defined by the Company as adjusted EBITDA exclusive of the depreciation addback noted above. The Company also utilizes non-GAAP financial measures whereby adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income are each divided by the Company s net sales to derive adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted operating margin, respectively. 
 Non-GAAP Net Income is defined by the Company as net income before, as applicable, (1) charge for fair value write-up of acquired inventory sold, (2) deal and transaction costs, (3) integration costs, (4) contractual and non-cash integration costs (5) severance and restructuring costs, (6) loss on extinguishment of debt and modification, (7) interest expense, net (8) gain on sale of business, (9) amortization of intangible assets and (10) the tax effect of the foregoing adjustments to net income, stated on a per share basis, divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Non-GAAP EPS is defined as our Non-GAAP Net Income divided by our diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. 
 The Company provides supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to help management and investors to better understand its business and believes these measures provide investors and analysts additional and meaningful information for the assessment of the Company s ongoing results. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to assist in the evaluation of the performance of its business segments and to make operating decisions. 
 Management believes the Company s non-GAAP measures help indicate the Company s baseline performance before certain gains, losses or other charges that may not be indicative of the Company s business or future outlook and offer a useful view of business performance in that the measures provide a more consistent means of comparing performance. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures aid investors overall understanding of the Company s results by providing a higher degree of transparency for such items and providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how management plans, measures and evaluates the Company s business performance. Management believes that the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides greater consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors understanding of the Company s historical operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods. 
 Management uses adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income to assist it in evaluations of the Company s operating performance by excluding items that management does not consider as relevant in the results of its ongoing operations. Internally, these non-GAAP measures are used by management for planning and forecasting purposes, including the preparation of internal budgets; for allocating resources to enhance financial performance; for evaluating the effectiveness of operational strategies; and for evaluating the Company s capacity to fund capital expenditures, secure financing and expand its business. 
 In addition, and as a consequence of the importance of these non-GAAP financial measures in managing its business, the Company s board of directors uses non-GAAP financial measures in the evaluation process to determine management compensation. 
 The Company believes that certain analysts and investors use adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income and non-GAAP EPS as supplemental measures to evaluate the overall operating performance of firms in the Company s industry. Additionally, lenders or potential lenders use adjusted EBITDA measures to evaluate the Company s creditworthiness.

 The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures or information provided in accordance with GAAP. Management strongly encourages investors to review the Company s consolidated financial statements in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure. 
 Management notes that the use of non-GAAP measures has limitations, including but not limited to: 
 First, non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized. Accordingly, the methodology used to produce the Company s non-GAAP financial measures is not computed under GAAP and may differ notably from the methodology used by other companies. For example, the Company s non-GAAP measure of adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to EBITDA or an adjusted EBITDA measure reported by other companies. 
 Second, the Company s non-GAAP financial measures exclude items such as amortization and depreciation that are recurring. Amortization of intangibles and depreciation have been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, significant recurring expenses with an impact upon the Company s results of operations, notwithstanding the lack of immediate impact upon cash flows. 
 Third, there is no assurance that the Company will not have future charges for fair value write-up of acquired inventory, restructuring activities, deal and transaction costs, integration costs, loss on extinguishment of debt or similar items and, therefore, may need to record additional charges (or credits) associated with such items, including the tax effects thereon. The exclusion of these items in the Company s non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an implication that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. 
 Management considers these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The calculations of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, and non-GAAP EPS, and reconciliations between these financial measures and their most directly comparable GAAP equivalents, are presented below in the accompanying tables.

 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks. 
 Entegris principal financial market risks are sensitivities to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company s interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents and variable rate debt are subject to interest rate fluctuations. The Company s cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of three months or less. A 100-basis point change in interest rates would potentially increase or decrease annual net income by approximately 15.5 million and 2.6 million annually for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. On July 28, 2022, the Company entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement to hedge the variability in SOFR-based interest payments associated with 1.95 billion of its 2.495 billion Initial Term Loan Facility. The notional amount is scheduled to decrease quarterly and will expire on December 30, 2025. 
 The cash flows and results of operations of the Company s foreign-based operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Approximately 22.7 and 23.5 of the Company s sales during 2022 and 2021 were collectively denominated in the South Korean won, New Taiwan dollar, Chinese renmibi, Canadian dollar, Malaysian ringgit, Singapore dollar, euro, Israeli shekel and the Japanese yen. Financial results therefore will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates. If all foreign currencies were to see a 10 reduction versus the U.S. dollar during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, revenue would be negatively impacted by approximately 62.6 million and 52.4 million, respectively. 
 The Company occasionally uses derivative financial instruments to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with its foreign-based operations. However, we are unlikely to be able to hedge these exposures completely. We do not enter into forward contracts or other derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. See Note 12 of the consolidated financials for additional information.

 Based on management s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Management s assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment. 
 
 As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the 
 Company completed its acquisition of CMC Materials on July 6, 2022. As permitted by interpretive guidance for newly 
 acquired businesses issued by the SEC Staff, management has excluded total assets of approximately 6,540.2 million and net sales of approximately 581.0 million related to CMC Materials that are included in the consolidated financial statements of Entegris and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Since the date of the acquisition of CMC Materials, CMC Materials financial results are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements. As part of our post-closing integration activities, we are engaged in the process of assessing the internal controls. The Company has begun to integrate policies, processes, people, technology and operations for the post acquisition combined company, and it will continue to evaluate the impact of any related changes to internal control over 
 financial reporting. 
 
 Based on its assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. We reviewed the results of management s assessment with the Audit Committee of our board of directors. 
 
 KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.

 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 Entegris, Inc.: 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited Entegris, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 22, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
 
 The Company acquired CMC Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries (CMC Materials) during 2022, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 CMC Material s internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of 6,540.2 million and total revenues of 581.0 million included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of CMC Materials. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 Entegris, Inc.: 
 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Entegris, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Fair value of certain acquired developed technology 
 
 As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, on July 6, 2022, the Company acquired CMC Materials, Inc. (CMC Materials) in a business combination. The fair value of developed technology acquired was 1,035.6 million. The fair value of these intangibles was estimated using an income approach, which utilized key assumptions such as future revenue growth rates and a discount rate. 
 
 We identified the evaluation of the acquisition date fair value of certain developed technology acquired in the CMC Materials acquisition as a critical audit matter. The estimated fair value was sensitive to changes in certain assumptions. Specifically, a high degree of subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the revenue growth rates and the discount rate assumptions. In addition, valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge were required to assess the discount rate. 
 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address the critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company s acquisition-date valuation process, including controls related to the development of the assumptions noted above. We evaluated the assumed revenue growth rates by comparing them to the historic growth rates of CMC Materials and to industry reports. In addition, we involved 
 F-2

 valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the discount rate by performing an independent analysis using inputs and assumptions and comparing the results to the Company s discount rate. 
 
 /s/ KPMG LLP 
 
 We or our predecessor firms have served as the Company s auditor since 1966.

As a result of the Merger, CMC Materials became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Merger was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting and the results of

 million associated with the acquisition of CMC Materials, consisting primarily of professional and consulting fees, were expensed as incurred in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, respectively.

The amounts of net sales and net loss from CMC Materials since the acquisition date included in the consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 a re million and million, respectively. 
 
 CMC Materials is a global supplier of consumable materials, primarily to semiconductor manufacturers. The Company's products play a critical role in the production of advanced semiconductor devices, helping to enable the manufacture of smaller, faster and more complex devices by its customers. The acquisition was executed to expand the Company s product offering base and technological base, enhance the Company s materials and process solutions for the most advanced manufacturing environments and help customers improve productivity, performance and total cost of ownership.

 Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company paid per share for all outstanding shares of CMC Materials (excluding treasury shares). In addition, the Company settled all outstanding share-based compensation awards held by CMC Materials employees at the same per share price except for certain unvested performance units that were replaced by the Company s restricted share units. The acquisition method of accounting requires the Company to include the amount associated with pre-combination service as purchase price for the acquisition, reflected in the table immediately above. 
 
 The Merger was funded with existing cash balances as well as funds raised by the Company through the issuance of debt in the form of a new term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of million, senior secured notes due 2029 in an aggregate principal amount of million, senior unsecured notes due 2030 in an aggregate principal amount of million, and a 364-Day Bridge Credit Facility in the aggregate principal amount of million (collectively CMC Materials Acquisition Financing ). For additional information, see Note 10 to the Company s consolidated financial statements.

 (1) In-process research and development assets are treated as indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development project, at which time the appropriate useful lives would be determined. 
 
 The fair value of acquired identifiable finite intangible assets was determined using an income method, which utilizes discounted cash flows to fair value each of the identifiable intangible assets. The Company normally utilizes the income method, which starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows attributable to the subject intangible asset. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Depending on the asset valued, the key assumptions included one or more of the following: (1) future revenue growth rates, (2) future gross margin, (3) future selling, general and administrative expenses, (4) royalty rates, and (5) discount rates. The valuations were based on the information that was available as of the acquisition date and the expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by the Company s management. There are inherent uncertainties and management judgment required in these determinations. The fair value measurements of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based on valuations involving significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 The purchase price of CMC Materials exceeded the fair value of the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed by million. Cash flows used to determine the purchase price included strategic and synergistic benefits (investment value) specific to the Company, which resulted in a purchase price in excess of the fair value of identifiable net assets. The purchase price also included the fair values of other assets that were not identifiable, not separately recognizable under accounting rules (e.g., assembled workforce) or of immaterial value in addition to a going-concern element that represents the Company's ability to earn a higher rate of return on the group of assets than would be expected on the separate assets as determined during the valuation process. This additional investment value resulted in goodwill. No amount of goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The assignment of goodwill to the Company's reportable segments will be finalized in connection with the final valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
 
 The final valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is expected to be completed as soon as possible, but no later than one year from the acquisition date. Given the size and complexity of the acquisition, the valuation of certain assets and liabilities is still being finalized. In addition to identifiable intangible assets, for the reasons noted above, the Company's valuation of the CMC Materials tax accounts is provisional pending the completion of and the Company's review of CMC Materials tax returns to be filed for periods up to the acquisition date. To the extent that the Company's estimates require adjustment, the Company will modify the value.

 The unaudited pro forma financial information above gives effect to the following: 
 
 The elimination of transactions between Entegris and CMC Materials, which upon completion of the Merger would be considered intercompany. This reflects the elimination of intercompany sales and associated intercompany accounts. 
 Incremental amortization and depreciation expense related to the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets and property, plant and equipment from the purchase price allocation. 
 Interest expense on the new debt raised to fund in part the consideration paid to effect the Merger using the effective interest rates. 
 The elimination of interest expense, net of the gain on the termination of two swap instruments which were terminated on June 24, 2022 associated with the extinguished CMC Materials debt outstanding. 
 The elimination of interest expense associated with the repayment of the million senior secured term loan facility due 2025. 
 The amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount associated with the aggregate new debt facilities. 
 Transaction and integration costs directly attributable to the Merger were reclassed as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period. 
 The incremental pro forma stock-based compensation expense for accelerated vesting upon the change in control for stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock shares, phantom units, and other deferred restricted stock units.

 As of December 31, 2022, goodwill amounted to approximately million, an increase of million from the balance at December 31, 2021. The increase in goodwill in 2022 reflects the acquisition of CMC Materials as described in Note 3, foreign currency translation, goodwill reclassified to asset held-for-sale as described in Note 4 and goodwill reallocation. The goodwill reallocation related to the creation of our new APS segment during the third quarter of 2022, which included a transfer of some related operations in our SCEM reportable segment to our APS reportable segment. We have allocated goodwill to our reporting units using a relative fair value approach. In addition, we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all reporting units immediately prior and subsequent to the reallocation and determined that no impairment existed. There were no goodwill impairments for any of the years presented. 
 The increase in goodwill in 2021 reflects the acquisition of the Precision Microchemicals business described in Note 3, other immaterial acquisition and foreign currency translation.

 Deferred tax assets are generally required to be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had net U.S. deferred tax liabilities of million and deferred tax assets of million, respectively, which are composed of temporary differences and various tax credit carryforwards. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state net operating loss carryforwards, state credit carryforwards and certain federal foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, management has provided valuation allowances of million and million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, on the related deferred tax assets. If the assumptions change and management determines the assets will be realized, the tax benefits relating to any reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at December 31, 2022 will be recognized as a reduction of income tax expense. 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company had state operating loss and credit carryforwards of approximately million, which began to expire in 2022, and foreign operating loss carryforwards of million, which begin to expire in 2023.

For other non-U.S. jurisdictions, management relies upon projections of future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets. 
 Benefits from tax positions should be recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that fail to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. The provisions also provide guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties.

Key inputs and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the grant price of the award, the expected option term, volatility of the Company s stock, the risk-free rate and the Company s dividend yield. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive equity awards, and subsequent events are not indicative of reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by the Company. 
 Risk-free interest rate Dividend yield Expected life (years) Weighted average fair value per option 
 A historical daily measurement of volatility is determined based on the expected life of the option granted. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the yield on an outstanding U.S. Treasury note with a term equal to the expected life of the option granted. Expected life is determined by reference to the Company s historical experience. The Company determines the dividend yield by dividing the expected annual dividend on the Company s stock by the option exercise price.

 During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company awarded performance-based restricted stock units for up to million, million and million shares of common stock, respectively, to be issued upon the achievement of performance conditions under the Company s stock plans to certain officers. Compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value. The awards vest on the third anniversary of the award date. The Company estimates the fair value of the performance shares using a Monte Carlo simulation process. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the total compensation cost related to unvested stock options, performance-based restricted stock units and restricted stock unit awards not yet recognized was million, million and million, respectively, and is expected to be recognized over the next years on a weighted-average basis. 
 Modifications 
 During the three months ended October 1, 2022, the Company modified all employee awards of restricted share units, options, and performance-based restricted share units that were granted in the 2022 fiscal year to provide that the awards will generally vest in connection with the grantee s qualifying retirement. The Company accounted for this as a modification of awards and recognized incremental compensation cost of million. The incremental compensation cost is measured as the accelerated expense over the requisite service period. The fair-value-based measure of the modified awards was the same as the fair-value based measure of the original award immediately before modification because the modification only affects the service period of the award. 
 
 In addition during the three months ended October 1, 2022, the Company modified restricted share units, options, and performance-based restricted share units granted prior to the 2022 fiscal year for two employees to accelerate the unvested awards upon their respective retirements from the Company. The Company accounted for this as a modification of awards and recognized incremental compensation cost of million. The incremental compensation cost is measured as the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before its terms modified and recognized as compensation cost on the date of the modification for the vested awards. 
 Valuation and Expense Information 
 The Company recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on their estimated fair values on the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized using the straight-line attribution method to recognize share-based compensation over the service period of the award, with adjustments recorded for forfeitures as they occur. Awards issued to employees who are retirement eligible or nearing retirement eligibility are expensed on an accelerated basis.

 Article I PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD 
 1.1. Award Date . This Agreement shall take effect as of the date specified as the Award Date with respect to the Award in the Award summary provided to you online through the Portal (the Award Date ). 
 1.2. Performance-based Restricted Stock Units Subject to Award . The Award consists of that number of performance-based restricted stock units (the PRSU with respect to the Stock that has been approved for the Award to Participant by the Administrator as the target number of PRSUs Target PRSUs ). The Target PRSUs shall be subject to increase or decrease in accordance with Sections 1.3 and 1.4 below. Each PRSU is equivalent to one share of the Stock (subject to adjustment under the Plan). The Participant s rights to the PRSU are subject to the restrictions described in this Agreement and in the Plan (which is incorporated herein by reference with the same effect as if set forth herein in full) in addition to such other restrictions, if any, as may be imposed by law. 
 1.3. Earned Performance-based Restricted Stock Units . The number of PRSUs earned under this Agreement (the Earned PRSUs shall be equal to the Target PRSUs multiplied by the TSR Performance Multiplier (as defined herein). The TSR Performance Multiplier will be determined by comparing the Company s total stockholder return to the total stockholder return of each of the companies in the Comparator Peer Group (as set forth below) over the period commencing on the Award Date and ending on the third anniversary of the Award Date (the Performance Period to determine the Company s TSR ranking against the Comparator Group. For purposes of computing total stockholder return (i) , any dividends paid by the Company or the companies in the Comparator Group shall be treated as having been reinvested at the closing price as of the ex-dividend date and (ii) the beginning stock price will be the average stock price over the 20 trading days ending on the Award Date and the ending stock price will be the average stock price over the 20 trading days ending on the last day of the Performance Period (adjusted, as applicable, for stock splits, reorganizations, recapitalizations, or similar corporate transactions during such period). 

1.4. Calculation of the TSR Performance Multiplier . The TSR Performance Multiplier will be calculated as set forth in the following table based upon the Company s total stockholder return over the Performance Period when ranked against the total stockholder return over the Performance Period of each of the companies in the Comparator Peer Group 
 Company TSR Percentile Rank 
 TSR Performance Multiplier 
 Below 25th percentile 
 0 
 25th percentile 
 50 
 50th percentile 
 100 
 85th percentile or above 
 200 

If the Company s total stockholder return percentile rank during the Performance Period is between the 25 th and the 50 th percentiles or between the 50 th and the 85 th percentiles, the TSR Performance Multiplier will be determined using straight line interpolation based on the actual percentile ranking. 
 As used herein, the Comparator Peer Group consists of those companies that are in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index on the Award Date provided that, except as provided below, the common stock (or similar equity security) of each such peer company is continually listed or traded on a national securities exchange from the first day of the Performance Period through the last trading day of the Performance Period. In the event a member of the Comparator Peer Group files for bankruptcy or liquidates due to an insolvency or is delisted due to failure to meet the national securities exchange s minimum market capitalization requirement, such company shall continue to be treated as a Comparator Peer Group member, and such company s ending price will be treated as 0 if the common stock (or similar equity security) of such company is no longer listed or traded on a national securities exchange on the last trading day of the Performance Period (and if multiple members of the Comparator Peer Group file for bankruptcy or liquidate due to an insolvency or are delisted for such reason, such members shall be ranked in order of when such bankruptcy or liquidation occurs, with earlier bankruptcies, liquidations or delistings ranking lower than later bankruptcies, liquidations or delistings). In the event of a formation of a new parent company by a Comparator Peer Group member, substantially all of the assets and liabilities of which consist immediately after the transaction of the equity interests in the original Comparator Peer Group member or the assets and liabilities of such Comparator Peer Group member immediately prior to the transaction, such new parent company shall be substituted for the Comparator Peer Group member to the extent (and for such period of time) as its common stock (or similar equity securities) are listed or traded on a national securities exchange but the common stock (or similar equity securities) of the original Comparator Peer Group member are not. In the event of a merger or other business combination of two Comparator Peer Group members (including, without limitation, the acquisition of one Comparator Peer Group member, or all or substantially all of its assets, by another Comparator Peer Group member), the surviving, resulting or successor entity, as the case may be, shall continue to be treated as a member of the Comparator Peer Group, provided that the common stock (or similar equity security) of such entity is listed or traded on a national securities exchange through the last trading day of the Performance Period. With respect to the preceding two sentences, the applicable stock prices shall be equitably and proportionately adjusted to the extent (if any) necessary to preserve the intended incentives of the awards and mitigate the impact of the transaction.

The Dividend Equivalent Amount, which shall be adjusted to reflect the number of Earned PRSUs, shall be subject to the same vesting conditions and settlement terms as the PRSU shares to which they relate.
