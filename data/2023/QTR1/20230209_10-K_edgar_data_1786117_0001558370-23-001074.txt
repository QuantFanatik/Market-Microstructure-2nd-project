These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the strength of the real estate market; the impact of a prolonged recession or downturn in economic conditions; our ability to successfully execute acquisition or development strategies; any loss of key management personnel; changes in local, regional, national and global economic conditions affecting the real estate development business and properties, including unstable macroeconomic conditions due to, among other things, geopolitical conflicts, inflation and rising interest rates; the impact of competitive real estate activity; the loss of any major property tenants; the ultimate geographic spread, severity and duration of pandemics, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities to contain or address the impact of such pandemics, and the potential negative impacts of such pandemics on the global economy and our financial condition and results of operations; and the availability of capital. These risks and uncertainties may cause our actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these risks, as well as additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those described in the Company s forward-looking statements.

 ITEM 1. BUSINESS OVERVIEW We are a real estate investment trust REIT that owns and operates a high-quality portfolio of commercial net lease properties all located in the United States. Our properties are primarily leased to industry leading, creditworthy tenants, many of which operate in industries we believe are resistant to the impact of e-commerce. Our portfolio consists of 148 net leased properties located in 106 markets in 34 states. The properties in our portfolio are primarily subject to long-term, triple-net leases, which generally require the tenant to pay all of the property operating expenses such as real estate taxes, insurance, assessments and other governmental fees, utilities, repairs and maintenance and certain capital expenditures. The Company has no employees and is externally managed by Alpine Income Property Manager, LLC (our Manager ), a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of CTO Realty Growth, Inc. (NYSE: CTO) CTO is a Maryland corporation that is a publicly traded diversified REIT and the sole member of our Manager. The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with its initial taxable year ended December 31, 2019. We believe the Company has been organized and has operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the U.S. federal income tax laws. We intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurances can be given that we will continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the U.S. federal income tax laws. Our primary objective is to maximize cash flow and value per share by generating stable and growing cash flows and attractive risk-adjusted returns through the ownership, operation and growth through acquisition of a diversified portfolio of high-quality, net leased commercial properties with attractive long-term real estate fundamentals. The 148 properties in our portfolio are 99 occupied and represent 3.7 million of gross rentable square feet with leases that have a weighted average lease term of 7.6 years (weighting based on annualized base rent as of December 31, 2022). Our portfolio is representative of our investment strategy, which consists of one or more of the following core investment criteria: Attractive Locations . The 148 properties in our portfolio represent 3.7 million gross rentable square feet, are 99 occupied, and are primarily located in, or in close proximity to major metropolitan statistical areas, or MSAs, and in markets in the United States with favorable economic and demographic conditions. As of December 31, 2022, a total of 57 of our portfolio s annualized base rent was derived from properties located in MSAs with populations greater than one million people. Creditworthy Tenants . 54 of our portfolio s annualized base rent as of December 31, 2022 was derived from tenants that have (or whose parent company has) an investment grade credit rating from a recognized credit rating agency. Our largest tenant, Walgreens, has a BBB credit rating from S P Global Ratings or its equivalent from Moody s Investor Services, Fitch Ratings or the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and contributed less than 10 of our portfolio s total revenue as of December 31, 2022. Geographic Diversity . Our portfolio is spread across 106 markets in 34 states. Our largest property, as measured by annualized base rent, is located in the Houston, Texas MSA. 99 Occupied with Primarily Long Duration Leases . Our portfolio is 99 leased and occupied. The leases in our portfolio have a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.6 years (weighted based on annualized base rent as of December 31, 2022). Contractual Rent Growth . As of December 31, 2022, 38 of the leases in our portfolio (based on annualized base rent as of December 31, 2022) provide for increases in contractual base rent during the lease term. Organization The Company is a Maryland corporation formed on August 19, 2019. On November 26, 2019, the Company closed its initial public offering IPO ). Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE under the

As of December 31, 2022, we have a total ownership interest in the Operating Partnership of 88.7 , with CTO holding, directly and indirectly, an 8.1 ownership interest in the Operating Partnership. The remaining 3.2 ownership interest is held by an unrelated third party in connection with the issuance of units of the operating partnership OP Units issued as consideration for a portfolio of net lease properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2021. Our interest in the Operating Partnership generally entitles us to share in cash distributions from, and in the profits and losses of, the Operating Partnership in proportion to our percentage ownership. We, through PINE GP, generally have the exclusive power under the partnership agreement to manage and conduct the business and affairs of the Operating Partnership, subject to certain approval and voting rights of the limited partners. Our Board of Directors (the Board manages our business and affairs. Each limited partner of the Operating Partnership has the right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem part or all of its OP Units for cash, based upon the value of an equivalent number of shares of our common stock at the time of the redemption, or, at our election, shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis, beginning on and after the date that is 12 months after issuance of such OP Units, subject to certain adjustments and the restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock set forth in our charter. Each redemption of OP Units will increase our percentage ownership interest in the Operating Partnership and our share of its cash distributions and profits and losses. We are externally managed by our Manager. Concurrently with the closing of the IPO, CTO invested 15.5 million in exchange for 815,790 shares of our common stock.

 Mortgage Notes Payable. On June 30, 2021, in connection with the acquisition of six net lease properties from CTO (the CMBS Portfolio ), the Company assumed an existing 30.0 million secured mortgage, which bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.33 (the CMBS Loan ). On December 1, 2022, the Company completed the defeasance of the CMBS Loan, unencumbering the CBMS Portfolio. The Company sold four of the six properties subsequent to the defeasance, during the year ended December 31, 2022. Additionally, on June 30, 2021, in connection with the acquisition of two net lease properties from an unrelated third party, the Company assumed mortgage notes totaling an aggregate of 1.6 million, which balance was repaid on July 1, 2021. Market Opportunity We believe the net lease property market has expanded steadily over the last several years, and investor demand for net leased properties has continued to gain momentum. Unlike a gross lease, which places the financial responsibility for most expenses with the property owner, the net lease structure shifts the majority or entirety of costs for property taxes, insurance, maintenance and often utilities and capital expenditures, to the lessee, in addition to rent payments. Net leases are generally executed for an initial term of 10 to 15 years, but 20- and 25-year leases are not uncommon. Lease agreements often include multiple options for the tenant to extend and may include terms for periodic rent increases. Comparatively, multi-tenant commercial real estate properties under gross leases often have average initial lease terms between five and ten years with shorter or fewer options to extend. Rent escalation is also commonly embedded in the net lease terms as a specified percentage increase of existing rent per year or determined by reference to an inflation measure such as the Consumer Price Index. With cash flows that are intended to be passive, stable and paid at regular intervals, net leased real estate is similar, in many ways, to interest-bearing corporate bonds, but with the additional potential for appreciation in the value of the underlying property. Investment Strategy We seek to acquire, own and operate primarily freestanding, commercial real estate properties located in the United States leased primarily pursuant to triple-net, long-term leases. We focus on investments primarily in retail properties. We target tenants in industries that we believe are favorably impacted by current macroeconomic trends that support consumer spending, such as strong and growing employment and positive consumer sentiment, as well as tenants in industries that have demonstrated resistance to the impact of the growing e-commerce retail sector or who use a physical presence as a component of their omnichannel strategy. We also seek to invest in properties that are net leased to tenants that we determine have attractive credit characteristics, stable operating histories and healthy rent coverage levels, are well-located within their respective markets and have rents at-or-below market rent levels. Furthermore, we believe that the size of our company allows us, for at least the near term, to focus our investment activities on the acquisition of single properties or smaller portfolios of properties that represent a transaction size that most of our publicly-traded net lease REIT peers will not pursue on a consistent basis. Our strategy for investing in income-producing properties is focused on factors including, but not limited to, long-term real estate fundamentals, including those markets experiencing significant economic growth. We employ a methodology for evaluating targeted investments in income-producing properties which includes an evaluation of: (i) the attributes of the real estate (e.g., location, market demographics, comparable properties in the market, etc.); (ii) an evaluation of the existing tenant(s) (e.g., credit-worthiness, property level sales, tenant rent levels compared to the market, etc.); (iii) other market-specific conditions (e.g., tenant industry, job and population growth in the market, local economy, etc.); and (iv) considerations relating to the Company s business and strategy (e.g., strategic fit of the asset type, property management needs, alignment with the Company s structure, etc.). We believe that the net leased properties we own and intend to acquire will provide our stockholders with investment diversification and can deliver strong risk-adjusted returns. We expect the majority of our net leased properties will be retail properties. We believe the risk-adjusted returns for other select property types within our portfolio are compelling and offer attractive investment yields, rental rates at or below prevailing market rental rates and an investment basis below replacement cost.

 (1) Annualized straight-line base rental income in place as of December 31, 2022. (2) The Alpine Valley Music Theatre, leased to Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., is an entertainment venue consisting of a two-sided, open-air, 7,500-seat pavilion; an outdoor amphitheater with a capacity for 37,000; and over 150 acres of green space. (3) We are the lessor in a ground lease with the tenant. Rentable square feet represents improvements on the property that revert to us at the expiration of the lease. (4) Subject to a master lease agreement. Certain individual tenants in the Company s portfolio of properties accounted for more than 10 of total revenues during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. No individual tenant accounted for more than 10 of total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Wells Fargo represented 12 of total revenues. Wells Fargo and Hilton Grand Vacations represented 19 and 12 of total revenues, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. There were no tenants who represented more than 10 of the square footage of our properties as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, 19 of the Company s real estate portfolio, based on square footage, was located in the state of Texas. Management Agreement On November 26, 2019, the Operating Partnership and PINE entered into a management agreement with the Manager (the Management Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms of the Management Agreement, our Manager manages, operates and administers our day-to-day operations, business and affairs, subject to the direction and supervision of the Board and in accordance with the investment guidelines approved and monitored by the Board. We pay our Manager a base management fee equal to 0.375 per quarter of our total equity (as defined in the Management Agreement and based on a 1.5 annual rate), calculated and payable in cash, quarterly in arrears. Our Manager has the ability to earn an annual incentive fee based on our total stockholder return exceeding an 8 cumulative annual hurdle rate (the Outperformance Amount subject to a high-water mark price. We would pay our Manager an incentive fee with respect to each annual measurement period in the amount of the greater of (i) 0.00 and (ii) the product of (a) 15 multiplied by (b) the Outperformance Amount multiplied by (c) the weighted average shares. No incentive fee was due for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, or 2020. The initial term of the Management Agreement will expire on November 26, 2024 and will automatically renew for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods thereafter, unless the agreement is not renewed or is terminated in accordance with its terms. Our independent directors review our Manager s performance and the management fees annually and, following the initial term, the Management Agreement may be terminated annually upon the affirmative vote of two-thirds of our independent directors or upon a determination by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock, based upon (i) unsatisfactory performance by the Manager that is materially detrimental to us or (ii) a determination that the management fees payable to our Manager are not fair, subject to our Manager s right to prevent such termination due to unfair fees by accepting a reduction of management fees agreed to by two-thirds of our independent directors. We may also terminate the Management Agreement for cause at any time, including during the initial term, without the payment

 of any termination fee, with 30 days prior written notice from the Board. During the initial term of the Management Agreement, we may not terminate the Management Agreement except for cause. We pay directly, or reimburse our Manager for certain expenses, if incurred by our Manager. We do not reimburse any compensation expenses incurred by our Manager or its affiliates. Expense reimbursements to our Manager are made in cash on a quarterly basis following the end of each quarter. In addition, we pay all of our operating expenses, except those specifically required to be borne by our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement. ROFO Agreement On November 26, 2019, PINE also entered into an Exclusivity and Right of First Offer Agreement with CTO (the ROFO Agreement ). During the term of the ROFO Agreement, CTO will not, and will cause each of its affiliates (which for purposes of the ROFO Agreement will not include our company and our subsidiaries) not to, acquire, directly or indirectly, a single-tenant, net leased property, unless CTO has notified us of the opportunity and we have affirmatively rejected the opportunity to acquire the applicable property or properties. The terms of the ROFO Agreement do not restrict CTO or any of its affiliates from providing financing for a third party s acquisition of single-tenant, net leased properties or from developing and owning any single-tenant, net leased property. Pursuant to the ROFO Agreement, neither CTO nor any of its affiliates (which for purposes of the ROFO Agreement does not include our company and our subsidiaries) may sell to any third party any single-tenant, net leased property that was owned by CTO or any of its affiliates as of the closing date of the IPO; or that is developed and owned by CTO or any of its affiliates after the closing date of the IPO, without first offering us the right to purchase such property. The term of the ROFO Agreement will continue for so long as the Management Agreement with our Manager is in effect. Conflicts of Interest Conflicts of interest may exist or could arise in the future with CTO and its affiliates, including our Manager, the individuals who serve as our executive officers and executive officers of CTO, any individual who serves as a director of our company and as a director of CTO and any limited partner of the Operating Partnership. Conflicts may include, without limitation: conflicts arising from the enforcement of agreements between us and CTO or our Manager; conflicts in the amount of time that executive officers and employees of CTO, who are provided to us through our Manager, will spend on our affairs versus CTO s affairs; and conflicts in future transactions that we may pursue with CTO and its affiliates. We do not generally expect to enter into joint ventures with CTO, but if we do so, the terms and conditions of our joint venture investment will be subject to the approval of a majority of disinterested directors of the Board. In addition, we are subject to conflicts of interest arising out of our relationships with our Manager. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, our Manager is obligated to supply us with our senior management team. However, our Manager is not obligated to dedicate any specific CTO personnel exclusively to us, nor are the CTO personnel provided to us by our Manager obligated to dedicate any specific portion of their time to the management of our business. Additionally, our Manager is a wholly owned subsidiary of CTO. All of our executive officers are executive officers and employees of CTO and one of our officers (John P. Albright) is also a member of CTO s board of directors. As a result, our Manager and the CTO personnel it provides to us may have conflicts between their duties to us and their duties to, and interests in, CTO. We may acquire or sell net leased properties that would potentially fit the investment criteria for our Manager or its affiliates. Similarly, our Manager or its affiliates may acquire or sell net leased properties that would potentially fit our investment criteria. Although such acquisitions or dispositions could present conflicts of interest, we nonetheless may pursue and consummate such transactions. Additionally, we may engage in transactions directly with our Manager or its affiliates, including the purchase and sale of all or a portion of a portfolio asset. If we acquire a net leased property from CTO or one of its affiliates or sell a net leased property to CTO or one of its affiliates, the purchase price we pay to CTO or one of its affiliates or the purchase price paid to us by CTO or one of its affiliates may be higher or lower, respectively,

 than the purchase price that would have been paid to or by us if the transaction were the result of arm s length negotiations with an unaffiliated third party. In deciding whether to issue additional debt or equity securities, we will rely, in part, on recommendations made by our Manager. While such decisions are subject to the approval of the Board, our Manager is entitled to be paid a base management fee that is based on our total equity (as defined in the Management Agreement). As a result, our Manager may have an incentive to recommend that we issue additional equity securities at dilutive prices. All of our executive officers are executive officers and employees of CTO. These individuals and other CTO personnel provided to us through our Manager devote as much time to us as our Manager deems appropriate. However, our executive officers and other CTO personnel provided to us through our Manager may have conflicts in allocating their time and services between us, on the one hand, and CTO and its affiliates, on the other. During a period of prolonged economic weakness or another economic downturn affecting the real estate industry or at other times when we need focused support and assistance from our Manager and the CTO executive officers and other personnel provided to us through our Manager, we may not receive the necessary support and assistance we require or that we would otherwise receive if we were self-managed. Additionally, the ROFO Agreement does contain exceptions to CTO s exclusivity for opportunities that include only an incidental interest in single-tenant, net leased properties. Accordingly, the ROFO Agreement will not prevent CTO from pursuing certain acquisition opportunities that otherwise satisfy our then-current investment criteria. Our directors and executive officers have duties to our company under applicable Maryland law in connection with their management of our company. At the same time, PINE GP has fiduciary duties, as the general partner, to the Operating Partnership and to the limited partners under Delaware law in connection with the management of the Operating Partnership. These duties as a general partner to the Operating Partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and executive officers to us. Unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement, Delaware law generally requires a general partner of a Delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of loyalty and care and which generally prohibits such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest. The partnership agreement provides that in the event of a conflict between the interests of our stockholders on the one hand and the limited partners of the Operating Partnership on the other hand, PINE GP will endeavor in good faith to resolve the conflict in a manner not adverse to either our stockholders or the limited partners; provided, however, that so long as we own a controlling interest in the Operating Partnership, any such conflict that we, in our sole and absolute discretion, determine cannot be resolved in a manner not adverse to either our stockholders or the limited partners of the Operating Partnership shall be resolved in favor of our stockholders, and we shall not be liable for monetary damages for losses sustained, liabilities incurred or benefits not derived by the limited partners in connection with such decisions. COMPETITION The real estate business, generally, is highly competitive. We intend to focus on investing in commercial real estate that produces income primarily through the leasing of assets to tenants. To identify investment opportunities in income-producing real estate assets and to achieve our investment objectives, we compete with numerous companies and organizations, both public as well as private, of varying sizes, ranging from organizations with local operations to organizations with national scale and reach, and in some cases, we compete with individual real estate investors. In all the markets in which we compete to acquire net leased properties, price is the principal method of competition, with transaction structure and certainty of execution also being significant considerations for potential sellers. We face competition for acquisitions of real property from investors, including traded and non-traded public REITs, private equity investors and institutional investment funds, some of which have greater financial resources than we do, a greater ability to borrow funds to acquire properties and the ability to accept more risk. This competition may increase the demand for the types of properties in which we typically invest and, therefore, reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us and increase the prices paid for such acquisition properties. This competition will increase if investments in real estate become more attractive relative to other forms of investment.

 As a landlord, we compete in the multi-billion-dollar commercial real estate market with numerous developers and owners of properties, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located. Some of our competitors have greater economies of scale, lower costs of capital, access to more resources and greater name recognition than we do. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose our tenants or prospective tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates or to offer substantial rent abatements, tenant improvement allowances, early termination rights or below-market renewal options in order to retain tenants when our leases expire. EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY STATUS We are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we are eligible to receive certain specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, exclusion from the requirement to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have irrevocably opted-out of the extended transition period afforded to emerging growth companies in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards. As a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the same time frames as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual gross revenue equals or exceeds 1.235 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (ii) December 31, 2024 (the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the IPO), (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities, and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. We are also a smaller reporting company as defined in Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies. We may be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. REGULATION General. Our properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including those relating to fire and safety requirements, and affirmative and negative covenants and, in some instances, common area obligations. Our tenants have primary responsibility for compliance with these requirements pursuant to our leases. We believe that each of our properties has the necessary permits and approvals. Americans With Disabilities Act. Under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act ADA ), and rules promulgated thereunder, in order to protect individuals with disabilities, public accommodations must remove architectural and communication barriers that are structural in nature from existing places of public accommodation to the extent readily achievable. In addition, under the ADA, alterations to a place of public accommodation or a commercial facility are to be made so that, to the maximum extent feasible, such altered portions are readily accessible to and usable by disabled individuals. The readily achievable standard considers, among other factors, the financial resources of the affected site and the owner, lessor or other applicable person. Compliance with the ADA, as well as other federal, state and local laws, may require modifications to properties we currently own or may purchase or may restrict renovations of those properties. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants, as well as the incurrence of the costs of making modifications to attain compliance, and future legislation could impose additional obligations or restrictions on our properties. Although our tenants are generally responsible for all maintenance and repairs of the property pursuant to our lease, including compliance with the ADA and other similar laws or regulations, we could be held liable as the owner of the property for a failure of one of our tenants to comply with these laws or regulations.

 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations regulate, and impose liability for, releases of hazardous or toxic substances into the environment. Under various of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner, operator or tenant of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances, hazardous wastes or petroleum product releases or threats of releases at the property, and may be held liable to a government entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation, clean-up and monitoring costs incurred by those parties in connection with the actual or threatened contamination. These laws may impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to fault, or whether the owner, operator or tenant knew of or caused the presence of the contamination. The liability under these laws may be joint and several for the full amount of the investigation, clean-up and monitoring costs incurred or to be incurred or actions to be undertaken, although a party held jointly and severally liable may seek to obtain contributions from other identified, solvent, responsible parties of their fair share toward these costs. These costs may be substantial and can exceed the value of the property. In addition, some environmental laws may create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. As the owner or operator of real estate, we may also be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate. The presence of contamination, or the failure to properly remediate contamination, on a property may adversely affect the ability of the owner, operator or tenant to sell or rent that property or to borrow using the property as collateral and may adversely impact our investment in that property. Some of our properties contain, have contained or are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. Similarly, some of our properties were used in the past for commercial or industrial purposes, or are currently used for commercial purposes, that involve or involved the use of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances or are adjacent to or near properties that have been or are used for similar commercial or industrial purposes. These operations create a potential for the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, and we could potentially be required to pay to clean up any contamination. In addition, environmental laws regulate a variety of activities that can occur on a property, including the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, air emissions, water discharges and exposure to lead-based paint. Such laws may impose fines or penalties for violations and may require permits or other governmental approvals to be obtained for the operation of a business involving such activities. As a result of the foregoing, we could be materially and adversely affected. Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance, and removal of asbestos-containing materials ACM ). Federal regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a building s management to identify and warn, through signs and labels, of potential hazards posed by workplace exposure to installed ACM in their building. The regulations also have employee training, record keeping and due diligence requirements pertaining to ACM. Significant fines can be assessed for violation of these regulations. As a result of these regulations, building owners and those exercising control over a building s management may be subject to an increased risk of personal injury lawsuits by workers and others exposed to ACM. The regulations may affect the value of a building containing ACM in which we have invested. Federal, state and local laws and regulations also govern the removal, encapsulation, disturbance, handling and/or disposal of ACM when those materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction, remodeling, renovation or demolition of a building. These laws may impose liability for improper handling or a release into the environment of ACM and may provide for fines to, and for third parties to seek recovery from, owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or improper work exposure associated with ACM. When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs.

 We obtain Phase I environmental assessments for properties acquired. Phase I environmental site assessments are limited in scope and therefore may not reveal all environmental conditions affecting a property. However, if recommended in the initial assessments, we may undertake additional assessments such as soil and/or groundwater samplings or other limited subsurface investigations and ACM or mold surveys to test for substances of concern. A prior owner or operator of a property or historic operations at our properties may have created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the site assessments. Material environmental conditions may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future, and future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material additional environmental liability. If environmental concerns are not satisfactorily resolved in any initial or additional assessments, we may obtain environmental insurance policies to insure against potential environmental risk or loss depending on the type of property, the availability and cost of the insurance and various other factors we deem relevant. Our ultimate liability for environmental conditions may exceed the policy limits on any environmental insurance policies we obtain, if any. Generally, our leases require the lessee to comply with environmental law and provide that the lessee will indemnify us for any loss or expense we incur as a result of the lessee s violation of environmental law or the presence, use or release of hazardous materials on our property attributable to the lessee. If our lessees do not comply with environmental law, or we are unable to enforce the indemnification obligations of our lessees, our results of operations would be adversely affected. We cannot predict what other environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist on our properties in the future. Compliance with existing and new laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to spend funds to remedy environmental problems. If we or our tenants were to become subject to significant environmental liabilities, we could be materially and adversely affected. EMPLOYEES The Company has no employees and is externally managed and advised by our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement. Our Manager is a wholly owned subsidiary of CTO. All of our executive officers serve as executive officers of CTO, and one of our executive officers and directors, John P. Albright, serves as an executive officer and director of CTO.

Our business is dependent upon our tenants successfully operating their businesses, and their failure to do so could materially and adversely affect us. Our assessment that certain of our tenants businesses are insulated from e-commerce pressure may prove to be incorrect, and changes in macroeconomic trends may adversely affect our tenants, either of which could impair our tenants ability to make rental payments to us and thereby materially and adversely affect us. Properties occupied by a single tenant pursuant to a single lease subject us to significant risk of tenant default. Our portfolio has geographic market concentrations that make us susceptible to adverse developments in those geographic markets. We are subject to risks related to tenant concentration, and an adverse development with respect to a large tenant could materially and adversely affect us. Certain of our tenants are not rated by a recognized credit rating agency or do not have an investment grade rating from such an agency. Leases with unrated or non-investment grade rated tenants may be subject to a greater risk of default. The decrease in demand for retail space may materially and adversely affect us. We may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-lease space as leases expire on favorable terms or at all. The tenants that occupy our properties compete in industries that depend upon discretionary spending by consumers. A reduction in the willingness or ability of consumers to use their discretionary income in the businesses of our tenants and potential tenants could adversely impact our tenants business and thereby adversely impact our ability to collect rents and reduce the demand for leasing our properties. The vacancy of one or more of our properties could result in us having to incur significant capital expenditures to re-tenant the space. We may be unable to identify suitable property acquisitions or developments, which may impede our growth, and our future acquisitions and developments may not yield the returns we expect. We face significant competition for tenants, which may adversely impact the occupancy levels of our portfolio or prevent increases of the rental rates of our properties. The costs of compliance with or liabilities related to environmental laws may materially and adversely affect us. Our properties may contain or develop harmful mold, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation.

 Our senior management team is required to operate two publicly traded companies, CTO and our company, which could place a significant strain on our senior management team and the management systems, infrastructure and other resources of CTO on which we rely. We have no employees and are entirely dependent upon our Manager for all the services we require, and we cannot assure you that our Manager will allocate the resources necessary to meet our business objectives. CTO may be unable to obtain or retain the executive officers and other personnel that it provides to us through our Manager. The base management fee payable to our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement is payable regardless of the performance of our portfolio, which may reduce our Manager s incentive to devote the time and effort to seeking profitable investment opportunities for us. The incentive fee payable to our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement may cause our Manager to select investments in more risky assets to increase its incentive compensation. There are conflicts of interest in our relationships with our Manager, which could result in outcomes that are not in our best interests. Termination of the Management Agreement could be difficult and costly, including as a result of payment of termination fees to our Manager, and may cause us to be unable to execute our business plan, which could materially and adversely affect us. The Management Agreement with our Manager and the ROFO Agreement with CTO were not negotiated on an arm s-length basis and may not be as favorable to us as if they had been negotiated with unaffiliated third parties. Failure to remain qualified as a REIT would cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for distributions to our stockholders. Even if we remain qualified as a REIT, we may face other tax liabilities that could reduce our cash flows and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. Failure to make required distributions would subject us to U.S. federal corporate income tax. Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities. The prohibited transactions tax may limit our ability to dispose of our properties. The ability of the Board to revoke our REIT qualification without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders. Dividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends. Risks Related to Our Business We are subject to risks related to the ownership of commercial real estate that could affect the performance and value of our properties. Factors beyond our control can affect the performance and value of our properties. Our core business is the ownership of commercial net leased properties. Accordingly, our performance is subject to risks incident to the ownership of commercial real estate, including: inability to collect rents from tenants due to financial hardship, including bankruptcy; changes in local real estate conditions in the markets where our properties are located, including the availability and demand for the properties we own; changes in consumer trends and preferences that affect the demand for products and services offered by our tenants; adverse changes in national, regional and local economic conditions; inability to lease or sell properties upon expiration or termination of existing leases; environmental risks, including the presence of hazardous or toxic substances on our properties; the subjectivity of real estate valuations and changes in such valuations over time; illiquidity of real estate investments, which may limit our ability to modify our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions; zoning or other local regulatory restrictions, or other factors pertaining to the local government institutions which inhibit interest in the markets in which our properties are located;

Table of Contents 
 changes in interest rates and the availability of financing; competition from other real estate companies similar to ours and competition for tenants, including competition based on rental rates, age and location of properties and the quality of maintenance, insurance and management services; acts of God, including natural disasters and global pandemics, such as the COVID-19 Pandemic, which impact the United States, which may result in uninsured losses; acts of war or terrorism, including consequences of terrorist attacks; changes in tenant preferences that reduce the attractiveness and marketability of our properties to tenants or cause decreases in market rental rates; costs associated with the need to periodically repair, renovate or re-lease our properties; increases in the cost of our operations, particularly maintenance, insurance or real estate taxes which may occur even when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in our revenues; changes in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations, fiscal policies and ordinances including in response to global pandemics whereby our tenants businesses are forced to close or remain open on a limited basis only; and commodities prices. 
 The occurrence of any of the risks described above may cause the performance and value of our properties to decline, which could materially and adversely affect us. Adverse changes in U.S., global and local regions or markets that impact our tenants businesses may materially and adversely affect us generally and the ability of our tenants to make rental payments to us pursuant to our leases. Our results of operations, as well as the results of operations of our tenants, are sensitive to changes in U.S., global and local regions or markets that impact our tenants businesses. Adverse changes or developments in U.S., global or regional economic conditions may impact our tenants financial condition, which may adversely impact their ability to make rental payments to us pursuant to the leases they have with us and may also impact their current or future leasing practices. Adverse economic conditions such as high unemployment levels, rising interest rates, increased tax rates and increasing fuel and energy costs may have an impact on the results of operations and financial conditions of our tenants, which would likely adversely impact us. During periods of economic slowdown and declining demand for real estate, we may experience a general decline in rents or increased rates of default under our leases. A lack of demand for rental space could adversely affect our ability to maintain our current tenants and gain new tenants, which may affect our growth, profitability and ability to pay dividends. Our business is dependent upon our tenants successfully operating their businesses, and their failure to do so could materially and adversely affect us. Most of our properties are occupied by a single tenant. Therefore, the success of our investments in these properties is materially dependent upon the performance of each property s respective tenants. The financial performance of any one of our tenants is dependent on the tenant s individual business, its industry and, in many instances, the performance of a larger business network that the tenant may be affiliated with or operate under. The financial performance of any one of our tenants could be adversely affected by poor management, unfavorable economic conditions in general, changes in consumer trends and preferences that decrease demand for a tenant s products or services or other factors, including the impact of a global pandemic which affects the United States, over which neither they nor we have control. Our portfolio includes properties leased to single tenants that operate in multiple locations, which means we own multiple properties operated by the same tenant. To the extent we own multiple properties operated by one tenant, the general failure of that single tenant or a loss or significant decline in its business could materially and adversely affect us. At any given time, any tenant may experience a decline in its business that may weaken its operating results or the overall financial condition of individual properties or its business as a whole. Any such decline may result in our tenant failing to make rental payments when due, declining to extend a lease upon its expiration, delaying occupancy of our property or the commencement of the lease or becoming insolvent or declaring bankruptcy. We depend on our tenants to 
 17 

Table of Contents 
 operate their businesses at the properties we own in a manner which generates revenues sufficient to allow them to meet their obligations to us, including their obligations to pay rent, maintain certain insurance coverage, pay real estate taxes, make repairs and otherwise maintain our properties. The ability of our tenants to fulfill their obligations under our leases may depend, in part, upon the overall profitability of their operations. Cash flow generated by certain tenant businesses may not be sufficient for a tenant to meet its obligations to us pursuant to the applicable lease. We could be materially and adversely affected if a tenant representing a significant portion of our operating results or a number of our tenants were unable to meet their obligations to us. Our assessment that certain of our tenants businesses are insulated from e-commerce pressure may prove to be incorrect, and changes in macroeconomic trends may adversely affect our tenants, either of which could impair our tenants ability to make rental payments to us and thereby materially and adversely affect us. We invest in properties leased, in many instances, to tenants engaged in businesses that we believe are generally insulated from the impact of e-commerce. While we believe our assessment to be accurate, businesses previously thought to be resistant to the pressure of the increasing level of e-commerce have ultimately been proven to be susceptible to competition from e-commerce. Overall business conditions and the impact of technology, particularly in the retail industry, are rapidly changing, and our tenants may be adversely affected by technological innovation, changing consumer preferences and competition from non-traditional sources. To the extent our tenants face increased competition from non-traditional competitors, such as internet vendors, their businesses could suffer. There can be no assurance that our tenants will be successful in meeting any new competition, and a deterioration in our tenants businesses could impair their ability to meet their lease obligations to us and thereby materially and adversely affect us. Additionally, we believe that many of the businesses operated by our tenants are benefiting from current favorable macroeconomic trends that support consumer spending, such as strong and growing employment levels, a relatively low interest rate environment and positive consumer sentiment. Economic conditions are generally cyclical, and developments that discourage consumer spending, such as increasing unemployment, wage stagnation, decreases in the value of real estate, inflation or increasing interest rates, could adversely affect our tenants, impair their ability to meet their lease obligations to us and materially and adversely affect us. Properties occupied by a single tenant pursuant to a single lease subject us to significant risk of tenant default. Most of our properties are occupied by a single tenant. Therefore, the financial failure of, or default in payment by, a tenant under its lease is likely to cause a significant or complete reduction in our rental revenue from that property and possibly a reduction in the value of the property. We may also experience difficulty or a significant delay in re-leasing or selling such property. This risk is magnified in situations where we lease multiple properties to a single tenant and the financial failure of the tenant s business affects more than a single property. A failure or default by such a tenant could reduce or eliminate rental revenue from multiple properties and reduce the value of such properties, which could materially and adversely affect us. We may experience a decline in the fair value of our real estate assets which could result in impairments and would impact our financial condition and results of operations. A decline in the fair market value of our long-lived assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets (as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, authoritative accounting guidance) if certain conditions or circumstances related to an asset were to change and we were to determine that, with respect to any such asset, that the cash flows no longer support the carrying value of the asset. The fair value of our long-lived assets depends on market conditions, including estimates of future demand for these assets, and the revenues that can be generated from such assets. If such a determination were to be made, we would recognize the estimated unrealized losses through earnings and write down the depreciated cost of such assets to a new cost basis, based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired. Such impairment charges reflect non-cash losses at the time of recognition, and subsequent dispositions or sales of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains, as they are based on the difference between the sales price received and the adjusted depreciated cost of such assets at the time of sale.

 Our portfolio has geographic market concentrations that make us susceptible to adverse developments in those geographic markets. In addition to general, regional, national, and global economic conditions, our operating performance is impacted by the economic conditions of the specific geographic markets in which we have concentrations of properties. Our portfolio includes substantial holdings in Texas as of December 31, 2022 (based on square footage). Our geographic concentrations could adversely affect our operating performance if conditions become less favorable in any of the states or markets within such states in which we have a concentration of properties. Such geographic concentrations could be heightened by the fact that our investments may be concentrated in certain areas that are affected by epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19 more than other areas. We cannot assure you that any of our markets will grow, not experience adverse developments or that underlying real estate fundamentals will be favorable to owners and operators of commercial properties. Our operations may also be affected if competing properties are built in our markets. A downturn in the economy in the states or regions in which we have a concentration of properties, or markets within such states or regions, could adversely affect our tenants operating businesses in those states or regions, impair their ability to pay rent to us and thereby, materially and adversely affect us. We are subject to risks related to tenant concentration, and an adverse development with respect to a large tenant could materially and adversely affect us. We have in the past and may in the future have significant tenant and property concentrations. In the event that a tenant that occupies a significant number of our properties or whose lease payments represent a significant portion of our rental revenue, were to experience financial difficulty or file for bankruptcy, it could have a material adverse effect on us. Certain of our tenants are not rated by a recognized credit rating agency or do not have an investment grade rating from such an agency. Leases with unrated or non-investment grade rated tenants may be subject to a greater risk of default. As of December 31, 2022, 46 of our tenants or parent entities thereof (based on annualized straight-line base rent) were not rated or did not have an investment grade credit rating from a recognized rating agency. Leases with non-investment grade or unrated tenants may be subject to a greater risk of default. Unrated tenants or non-investment grade tenants may also be more likely to experience financial weakness or file for bankruptcy than tenants with investment grade credit ratings. When we consider the acquisition of a property with an in-place lease with an unrated or non-investment grade rated tenant or leasing a property to a tenant that does not have a credit rating or does not have an investment grade rating, we evaluate the strength of the proposed tenant s business at the property level and at a corporate level, if applicable, and may consider the risk of tenant/company insolvency using internally developed methodologies or assessments provided by third parties. If our evaluation of an unrated or non-investment grade tenant s creditworthiness is inaccurate, the default or bankruptcy risk related to the tenant may be greater than anticipated. In the event that any of our unrated tenants were to experience financial weakness or file for bankruptcy, it could have a material adverse effect on us. The decrease in demand for retail space may materially and adversely affect us. As of December 31, 2022, 100 of leases based on annualized straight-line base rent were with tenants operating retail businesses. In the future, we intend to acquire additional properties leased to a single tenant operating a retail business at the property. Accordingly, decreases in the demand for leasing retail space may have a greater adverse effect on us than if we had fewer investments in retail properties. The market for leasing of retail space has historically been adversely affected by weakness in the national, regional and local economies, the adverse financial condition of some large retail companies, consolidation in the retail industry, the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets and increasing e-commerce pressure. To the extent that adverse conditions arise or continue, they are likely to negatively affect market rents for retail space and could materially and adversely affect us.

 We may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-lease space as leases expire on favorable terms or at all. Our results of operations depend on our ability to lease our properties, including renewing expiring leases, leasing vacant space and re-leasing space in properties where leases are expiring, and leasing space related to new project development. In leasing or re-leasing our properties, we may be unable to optimize our tenant mix or execute leases on more economically favorable terms than the prior in-place lease. Our tenants may decline, or may not have the financial resources available, to renew their leases, and there can be no assurance that leases that are renewed will have terms that are as economically favorable to us as the expiring lease terms. If tenants do not renew their leases as they expire, we will have to source new tenants to lease our properties, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to find new tenants or that our properties will be re-leased at rental rates equal to or above the previous in-place lease or current average rental rates or that substantial rent abatements, tenant improvement allowances, early termination rights or below-market renewal options will not be offered to attract new tenants. We may experience increased costs in connection with re-leasing our properties, which could materially and adversely affect us. Certain provisions of our leases may be unenforceable. Our rights and obligations with respect to our leases are governed by written agreements. A court could determine that one or more provisions of such an agreement are unenforceable. We could be adversely impacted if this were to happen with respect to a property or group of properties. The bankruptcy or insolvency of any of our tenants could result in the termination of such tenant s lease and material losses to us. The occurrence of a tenant bankruptcy or insolvency would likely diminish the income we receive from that tenant s lease or leases or force us to re-tenant a property as a result of a default of the in-place tenant or a rejection of a tenant lease by a bankruptcy court. If a tenant files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, federal law may prohibit us from evicting such tenant based solely upon such bankruptcy or insolvency. In addition, a bankrupt or insolvent tenant may be authorized to reject and terminate its lease or leases with us. Any claims against such bankrupt tenant for unpaid rent or future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that would likely result in our receipt of rental revenues that are substantially less than the contractually specified rent we are owed under the lease or leases. In addition, any claim we have for unpaid past rent, if any, may not be paid in full. We may also be unable to re-lease a property in which the in-place lease was not terminated or rejected or to re-lease it on comparable or more favorable terms. As a result, tenant bankruptcies or insolvencies may materially and adversely affect us. We may not acquire the properties that we evaluate in our pipeline. We will generally seek to maintain a robust pipeline of investment opportunities. Transactions may fail to close for a variety of reasons, including the discovery of previously unknown liabilities or other items uncovered during our diligence process. Similarly, we may never execute binding purchase agreements with respect to properties that are currently subject to non-binding letters of intent, and properties with respect to which we are negotiating may never lead to the execution of any letter of intent. For many other reasons, we may not ultimately acquire the properties in our pipeline. As we continue to acquire properties, we may decrease or fail to increase the diversity of our portfolio. While we will seek to maintain or increase our portfolio s tenant, geographic and industry diversification with future acquisitions, it is possible that we may determine to consummate one or more acquisitions that actually decrease our portfolio s diversity. If our portfolio becomes less diverse, our business will be more sensitive to tenant or market factors, including the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants, to changes in consumer trends of a particular industry and to a general economic downturn or downturns in a market or particular geographic area.

 We may obtain only limited warranties when we acquire a property and may only have limited recourse if our due diligence did not identify any issues that may subject us to unknown liabilities or lower the value of our property, which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to you. The seller of a property often sells the property in its as is condition on a where is basis and with all faults, without any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular use or purpose. In addition, purchase agreements may contain only limited warranties, representations and indemnifications that will survive for only a limited period after the closing. The acquisition of, or purchase of, properties with limited warranties increases the risk that we may lose some or all of our invested capital in the property, lose rental income from that property or may be subject to unknown liabilities with respect to such properties. The tenants that occupy our properties compete in industries that depend upon discretionary spending by consumers. A reduction in the willingness or ability of consumers to use their discretionary income in the businesses of our tenants and potential tenants could adversely impact our tenants business and thereby adversely impact our ability to collect rents and reduce the demand for leasing our properties. Certain properties in our portfolio are leased to tenants operating retail, service-oriented or experience-based businesses. General merchandise, financial services, hospitality, home furnishings and entertainment represent a significant portion of the industries in our portfolio. The success of most of the tenants operating businesses in these industries depends on consumer demand and, more specifically, the willingness of consumers to use their discretionary income to purchase products or services from our tenants. The ability of consumers to use their discretionary income may be impacted by issues including a global pandemic that impacts the United States. A prolonged period of economic weakness, another downturn in the U.S. economy or accelerated dislocation of these industries due to the impact of e-commerce, could cause consumers to reduce their discretionary spending in general or spending at these locations in particular, which could have a material and adverse effect on us. The vacancy of one or more of our properties could result in us having to incur significant capital expenditures to re-tenant the space. The loss of a tenant, either through lease expiration or tenant bankruptcy or insolvency, may require us to spend significant amounts of capital to renovate the property before it is suitable for a new tenant and cause us to incur significant costs to source new tenants. In many instances, the leases we enter into or assume through acquisition are for properties that are specifically suited to the particular business of our tenants. Because these properties have been designed or physically modified for a particular tenant, if the current lease is terminated or not renewed, we may be required to renovate the property at substantial costs, decrease the rent we charge or provide other concessions in order to lease the property to another tenant. In addition, in the event we decide to sell the property, we may have difficulty selling it to a party other than the tenant due to the special purpose for which the property may have been designed or modified. This potential limitation on our ability to sell a property may limit our ability to quickly modify our portfolio in response to changes in our tenants business prospects, economic or other conditions, including tenant demand. These limitations may materially and adversely affect us. We may be unable to identify and complete suitable property acquisitions or developments, which may impede our growth, and our future acquisitions and developments may not yield the returns we expect. Our ability to expand through acquisitions and developments requires us to identify and complete acquisitions and new property developments that are consistent with our investment and growth strategy and our investment criteria and to successfully integrate newly acquired properties into our portfolio. Our Manager continually evaluates investment opportunities for us, but our ability to acquire or develop new properties on favorable terms and successfully operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks: we face competition from commercial developers and other real estate investors with significant capital, including REITs and institutional investment funds, which may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks associated with paying higher acquisition prices; 
 21 

Table of Contents 
 we face competition from other potential acquirers which may significantly increase the purchase price for a property we acquire, which could reduce our growth prospects; we may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with evaluating and negotiating potential acquisitions and developments, including ones that we are unable to complete; we may acquire properties that are not accretive to our results of operations upon acquisition, and we may be unsuccessful in managing and leasing such properties in accordance with our expectations; our cash flow from an acquired or developed property may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments with respect to debt used to finance the acquisition or development of such property; we may discover unexpected issues, such as unknown liabilities, during our due diligence investigation of a potential acquisition or other customary closing conditions may not be satisfied, causing us to abandon an investment opportunity after incurring expenses related thereto; we may fail to obtain financing for an acquisition or new property development on favorable terms or at all; we may spend more than budgeted amounts to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties; market conditions may result in higher than expected vacancy rates and lower than expected rental rates; and we may acquire properties subject to (i) liabilities without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination not revealed in Phase I environmental site assessments or otherwise through due diligence, (ii) claims by tenants, vendors or other persons dealing with the former owners of the properties, (iii) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business, and (iv) claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties. If any of these risks are realized, we may be materially and adversely affected. We may be unable to complete acquisitions of properties owned by CTO that are covered by the ROFO Agreement, and any completed acquisitions of such properties may not yield the returns we expect. Although the ROFO Agreement provides us with a right of first offer with respect to certain single-tenant, net leased properties owned by CTO, there can be no assurance that CTO will elect to sell these properties in the future. Even if CTO elects to sell these properties in the future, we may be unable to reach an agreement with CTO on the terms of the purchase of such properties or may not have the funds or ability to finance the purchase of such properties. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire any properties covered by the ROFO Agreement in the future. Further, even if we are able to acquire properties covered by the ROFO Agreement, there is no guarantee that such properties will be able to maintain their historical performance, or that we will be able to realize the same returns from those properties as CTO. We face significant competition for tenants, which may adversely impact the occupancy levels of our portfolio or prevent increases of the rental rates of our properties. We compete with numerous developers, owners and operators of net leased properties, many of which are much larger and own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located. The size and financial wherewithal of our competitors may allow them to offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we charge our tenants. As a result, we may lose existing tenants or fail to obtain future tenants, and the downward pressure caused by these other owners, operators and developers may cause us to reduce our rental rates or to offer more substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or below-market renewal options in order to retain tenants when our leases expire. Competition for tenants could adversely impact the occupancy levels of our portfolio or prevent increases of the rental rates of our properties, which could materially and adversely affect us. Inflation may materially and adversely affect us and our tenants. Increased inflation could have an adverse impact on interest rates, which would likely negatively impact the cost of any variable rate debt that we obtain in the future. During times when inflation is increasing at a greater rate than the increases in rent provided by our leases, our rent levels will not keep up with the costs associated with rising inflation. 
 22 

Table of Contents 
 Increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases they might achieve in revenues, which may adversely affect the tenants ability to pay rent owed to us. The redevelopment or renovation of our properties may cause us to experience unexpected costs and have other risks that could materially and adversely affect us. We may in the future redevelop, significantly renovate or otherwise invest additional capital in our properties to improve them and enhance the opportunity for achieving attractive risk-adjusted returns. These activities are subject to a number of risks, including risks associated with construction work and risks of cost overruns due to construction delays or other factors that may increase the expected costs of a project. In addition, we may incur costs in connection with projects that are ultimately not pursued to completion. Any of our redevelopment or renovation projects may be financed. If such financing is not available on acceptable terms, our redevelopment and renovation activities may not be pursued or may be curtailed. In addition, such activities would likely reduce the available borrowing capacity on the Credit Facility or any other credit facilities that we may have in place in the future, which would limit our ability to use those sources of capital for the acquisition of properties and other operating needs. The risks associated with redevelopment and renovation activities, including but not necessarily limited to those noted above, could materially and adversely affect us. Our real estate investments are generally illiquid, which could significantly affect our ability to respond to market changes or adverse changes relating to our tenants or in the performance of our properties. The real estate investments made, and expected to be made, by us are relatively difficult for us to sell quickly. As a result, our ability to make rapid adjustments in the size and content of our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions will be limited. Illiquid assets typically experience greater price volatility, as a ready market does not exist, and can be more difficult to value. In addition, validating third party pricing for illiquid assets may be more subjective than more liquid assets. As a result, if we are required to quickly liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our assets. In addition, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), imposes restrictions on a REIT s ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies. In particular, the tax laws applicable to REITs effectively require that we hold our properties for investment, rather than primarily for sale in the ordinary course of business, which may cause us to forgo or defer sales of properties that otherwise would be in our best interest. Therefore, we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on favorable terms, which may materially and adversely affect us. We may not be able to dispose of properties we target for sale to recycle our capital. Although we may seek to selectively sell properties to recycle our capital, we may be unable to sell properties targeted for disposition due to adverse market or other conditions, or not achieve the pricing or timing that is consistent with our expectations. This may adversely affect, among other things, our ability to deploy capital into the acquisition of other properties and the execution of our overall operating strategy, which could, consequently, materially and adversely affect us. The development of new projects and/or properties may cause us to experience unexpected costs and have other risks that could materially and adversely affect us. We may develop new projects to enhance the opportunity for achieving attractive risk-adjusted returns. New project development is subject to a number of risks, including risks associated with the availability and timely receipt of zoning and other regulatory approvals, the timely completion of construction (including risks from factors beyond our control, such as weather, labor conditions or material shortages) and risks of cost overruns due to construction delays or other factors that may increase the expected costs of a project. These risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays and, under certain circumstances, provide a tenant the opportunity to delay rent commencement, reduce rent or terminate a lease. In addition, we may incur costs in connection with projects that are ultimately not pursued to completion. Any new development projects may be financed. If such financing is not available on acceptable terms, our development activities may not be pursued or may be curtailed. In addition, such activities would likely reduce the available borrowing capacity 
 23 

Table of Contents 
 on the revolving credit facility or any other credit facilities that we may have in place in the future, which would limit our ability to use those sources of capital for the acquisition of properties and other operating needs. The risks associated with new project development activities, including but not necessarily limited to those noted above, could materially and adversely affect us. The success of our activities related to new project development in which we will retain an ownership interest is partly dependent on the availability of suitable undeveloped land at acceptable prices. Our success in developing projects that we will retain an ownership interest in is partly dependent upon the availability of undeveloped land suitable for the intended development. The availability of undeveloped land for purchase at acceptable prices depends on a number of factors outside of our control, including the risk of competitive over-bidding on land and governmental regulations that restrict the potential uses of land. If the availability of suitable land opportunities decreases, the number of development projects we may be able to undertake could be reduced. Thus, the lack of availability of suitable land opportunities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and growth prospects. Risks Related to Certain Events, Environmental Matters and Climate Change Natural disasters, terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or war or other unexpected events could materially and adversely affect us. Natural disasters, terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or war or other unexpected events, including a global pandemic that impacts the economy in the United States, could materially interrupt our business operations (or those of our tenants), cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets and economies. They also could result in or prolong an economic recession. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect us. In addition, our corporate headquarters and certain of our properties are located in Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred. Depending on where any hurricane makes landfall, our properties in Florida could experience significant damage. In addition, the occurrence and frequency of hurricanes in Florida could also negatively impact demand for our properties located in that state because of consumer perceptions of hurricane risks. In addition to hurricanes, the occurrence of other natural disasters and climate conditions in Florida (and in other states where our properties are located), such as tornadoes, floods, fires, unusually heavy or prolonged rain, droughts and heat waves, could have an adverse effect on our tenants, which could adversely impact our ability to collect rental revenues. If a hurricane, earthquake, natural disaster or other similar significant disruption occurs, we may experience disruptions to our operations and damage to our properties, which could materially and adversely affect us. Terrorist attacks or other acts of violence may also negatively affect our operations. There can be no assurance that there will not be terrorist attacks against businesses within the U.S. These attacks may directly impact our physical assets or business operations or the financial condition of our tenants, lenders or other institutions with which we have a relationship. The U.S. may be engaged in armed conflict, which could also have an impact on the tenants, lenders or other institutions with which we have a relationship. The consequences of armed conflict are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect us. Insurance on our properties may not adequately cover all losses and uninsured losses could materially and adversely affect us. Our leases typically provide that either the landlord or the tenant will maintain property and liability insurance for the properties that are leased from us. If our tenants are required to carry liability and/or property insurance coverage, our tenants are required to name us (and any of our lenders that have a mortgage on the property leased by the tenant) as additional insureds on their liability policies and additional named insured and/or loss payee (or mortgagee, in the case of our lenders) on their property policies. Depending on the location of the property, losses of a catastrophic nature, such as those caused by hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, may be covered by insurance policies that are held by our tenant with limitations such as large deductibles or co-payments that a tenant may not be able to meet. In addition, losses of a 
 24 

Table of Contents 
 catastrophic nature, such as those caused by wind, hail, hurricanes, terrorism or acts of war, may be uninsurable or not economically insurable. In the event there is damage to our properties that is not covered by insurance and such properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we will continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties are irreparably damaged. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors, including terrorism or acts of war, may make any insurance proceeds we receive insufficient to repair or replace a property if it is damaged or destroyed. In those circumstances, the insurance proceeds received may not be adequate to restore our economic position with respect to the affected real property and its generation of rental revenue. Furthermore, in the event we experience a substantial or comprehensive loss of one of our properties, we may not be able to rebuild such property to its existing specifications without significant capital expenditures which may exceed any amounts received pursuant to insurance policies, as reconstruction or improvement of such a property would likely require significant upgrades to meet zoning and building code requirements. The loss of our capital investment in or anticipated future returns from our properties due to material uninsured losses could materially and adversely affect us. The costs of compliance with or liabilities related to environmental laws may materially and adversely affect us. The ownership of our properties may subject us to known and unknown environmental liabilities. Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, as a current or former owner or operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from environmental matters, including the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances, waste or petroleum products at, on, in, under or migrating from such property, as well as costs to investigate or clean up such contamination and liability for personal injury, property damage or harm to natural resources. We may face liability regardless of: our knowledge of the contamination; the timing of the contamination; the cause of the contamination; or the party responsible for the contamination of the property. There may be environmental liabilities associated with our properties of which we are unaware. We obtain Phase I environmental assessments for properties acquired. Phase I environmental site assessments are limited in scope and therefore may not reveal all environmental conditions affecting a property. Therefore, there could be undiscovered environmental liabilities on the properties we own. Some of our properties use, or may have used in the past, underground tanks for the storage of petroleum-based products or waste products that could create a potential for release of hazardous substances or penalties if tanks do not comply with legal standards. If environmental contamination exists on our properties, we could be subject to strict, joint and/or several liability for the contamination by virtue of our ownership interest. Some of our properties may contain asbestos-containing materials, or ACM. Environmental laws govern the presence, maintenance and removal of ACM and such laws may impose fines, penalties or other obligations for failure to comply with these requirements or expose us to third-party liability (for example, liability for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos). Environmental laws also apply to other activities that can occur on a property, such as storage of petroleum products or other hazardous toxic substances, air emissions, water discharges and exposure to lead-based paint. Such laws may impose fines and penalties for violations and may require permits or other governmental approvals to be obtained for the operation of a business involving such activities. The known or potential presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or improve the property or to borrow using the property as collateral. In addition, environmental laws may create liens on contaminated properties in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs to address such contamination. Moreover, if contamination is discovered on our properties, environmental laws may impose restrictions on the manner in which they may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures. In addition, although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from a tenant s activities on the property, we could be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest. We cannot be sure that our tenants will, or will be able to, satisfy their indemnification obligations, if any, under our leases. Furthermore, the discovery of environmental liabilities on any of our 
 25 

Table of Contents 
 properties could lead to significant remediation costs or to other liabilities or obligations attributable to the tenant of that property or could result in material interference with the ability of our tenants to operate their businesses as currently operated. Noncompliance with environmental laws or discovery of environmental liabilities could each individually or collectively affect such tenant s ability to make payments to us, including rental payments and, where applicable, indemnification payments. Our environmental liabilities may include property and natural resources damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs, among other potential environmental liabilities. These costs could be substantial. Although we may obtain insurance for environmental liability for certain properties that are deemed to warrant coverage, our insurance may be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and we may be unable to continue to obtain insurance for environmental matters, at a reasonable cost or at all, in the future. If our environmental liability insurance is inadequate, we may become subject to material losses for environmental liabilities. Our ability to receive the benefits of any environmental liability insurance policy will depend on the financial stability of our insurance company and the position it takes with respect to our insurance policies. If we were to become subject to significant environmental liabilities, we could be materially and adversely affected. Our properties may contain or develop harmful mold, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation. When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing, as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, should our tenants or their employees or customers be exposed to mold at any of our properties, we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property. In addition, exposure to mold by our tenants or others could subject us to liability if property damage or health concerns arise. If we were to become subject to significant mold-related liabilities, we could be materially and adversely affected. Our operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by climate change, including possible changes in weather patterns, weather-related events, government policy, laws, regulations and economic conditions. In recent years, the assessment of the potential impact of climate change has begun to impact the activities of government authorities, the pattern of consumer behavior and other areas that impact the business environment in the U.S., including, but not limited to, energy-efficiency measures, water use measures and land-use practices. The promulgation of policies, laws or regulations relating to climate change by governmental authorities in the U.S. and the markets in which we own properties may require us to invest additional capital in our properties. In addition, the impact of climate change on businesses operated by our tenants is not reasonably determinable at this time. While not generally known at this time, climate change may impact weather patterns or the occurrence of significant weather events which could impact economic activity or the value of our properties in specific markets. The occurrence of any of these events or conditions may adversely impact our ability to lease our properties, which would materially and adversely affect us. Risks Related to Other Aspects of our Operation and as a Public Company We are highly dependent on information systems and certain third-party technology service providers, and systems failures not related to cyber-attacks or similar external attacks could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect the market price of our common stock and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. Our business is highly dependent on communications and information systems and networks. Any failure or interruption of these systems or networks could cause delays or other problems in our operations and communications. Through our relationship with CTO and our Manager, we rely heavily on CTO s financial, accounting and other data processing systems. In addition, much of the information technology infrastructure on which we rely is or may be managed by third parties and, as such, we also face the risk of operational failure, termination or capacity constraints by any of these third parties. It is difficult to determine what, if any, negative impact may directly result from any specific interruption or 
 26 

Table of Contents 
 disruption of the networks or systems on which our business relies or any failure to maintain performance, reliability and security of our technological infrastructure, but significant events impacting the systems or networks on which our business relies could materially and adversely affect us. Our senior management team is required to operate two publicly traded companies, CTO and our company, which could place a significant strain on our senior management team and the management systems, infrastructure and other resources of CTO on which we rely. Our senior management team operates two publicly traded companies, our company and CTO, and is required to comply with periodic and current reporting requirements under applicable SEC regulations and comply with applicable listing standards of the NYSE. This could place a significant strain on our senior management team and the management systems, infrastructure and other resources of CTO made available to us through our Manager and on which we rely. There can be no assurance that our senior management team will be able to successfully operate two publicly traded companies. Any failure by our senior management team to successfully operate our company or CTO could materially and adversely affect us. If there are deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately present our financial statements, which could materially and adversely affect us. As a publicly traded company, we are required to report our financial statements on a consolidated basis. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to accurately report our financial results. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will require us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. However, for as long as we are an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We could be an emerging growth company through December 31, 2024 (the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the IPO). An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls could detect problems that our management s assessment might not. There can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Furthermore, as we grow our business, our internal controls will become more complex, and we may require significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective. Future deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting which may occur could result in misstatements of our results of operations that could require a restatement, failing to meet our public company reporting obligations and causing investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could materially and adversely affect us. Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and fire, safety and other regulations may require us to make unanticipated expenditures that materially and adversely affect us. Our properties are and will be subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act, or the ADA. Under the ADA, all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Compliance with the ADA requirements could require removal of access barriers and non-compliance could result in imposition of fines by the U.S. government or an award of damages to private litigants, or both. While our tenants are and will be obligated by law to comply with the ADA and typically obligated under our leases to cover costs associated with compliance, if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of our tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected. We could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ADA, which could materially and adversely affect us. In addition, we are and will be required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties. We may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and may be required to obtain approvals from various authorities with respect to our properties, including prior to acquiring a property or when undertaking renovations of any of our existing properties. There can be no assurance that existing laws and regulatory policies will not adversely affect us or the timing or cost of any future acquisitions, developments or renovations, or that additional regulations will not be adopted that increase such delays or result in additional costs. Additionally, failure to comply with any of these requirements could result in the imposition of fines by 
 27 

Table of Contents 
 governmental authorities or awards of damages to private litigants. While we intend to only acquire properties that we believe are currently in substantial compliance with all regulatory requirements, these requirements may change, and new requirements may be imposed which would require significant unanticipated expenditures by us and could materially and adversely affect us. We have in the past and may in the future choose to acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions, which could result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell such assets. We have in the past acquired, and may in the future acquire, properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for common or preferred units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, which may result in stockholder dilution. This acquisition structure may have the effect of, among other things, reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties, and may require that we agree to protect the contributors ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties and/or the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases. These restrictions could limit our ability to sell an asset at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions. Risks Related to Our Relationship with CTO and Our Manager and the Management Agreement We have no employees and are entirely dependent upon our Manager for all the services we require, and we cannot assure you that our Manager will allocate the resources necessary to meet our business objectives. Because we are externally managed, we do not employ our own personnel, but instead depend upon CTO, our Manager and their affiliates for virtually all of the services we require. Our Manager selects and manages the acquisition of properties that meet our investment criteria; administers the collection of rents, monitors lease compliance by our tenants and deals with vacancies and re-letting of our properties; coordinates the sale of our properties; provides financial and regulatory reporting services; communicates with our stockholders, causes us to pay distributions to our stockholders and arranges for transfer agent services; and provides all of our other administrative services. Accordingly, our success is largely dependent upon the expertise and services of the executive officers and other personnel of CTO provided to us through our Manager. CTO may be unable to obtain or retain the executive officers and other personnel that it provides to us through our Manager. Our success depends to a significant degree upon the executive officers and other personnel of CTO that it provides to us through our Manager. In particular, we rely on the services of John P. Albright, President and Chief Executive Officer of our company and CTO and a member of the board of directors of our company and CTO; Matthew M. Partridge, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of our company and CTO; Steven R. Greathouse, Senior Vice President and Chief Investment Officer of our company and CTO; and Daniel E. Smith, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of our company and CTO. In addition to these executive officers, we also rely on other personnel of CTO that are provided to us through our Manager. We cannot guarantee that all, or any particular one of these executive officers and other personnel of CTO provided to us through our Manager, will remain affiliated with CTO, our Manager and us. We do not separately maintain key person life insurance on any person. Failure by CTO to retain any of its executive officers and other personnel provided to us through our Manager and to hire and retain additional highly skilled managerial, operational and marketing personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our investment growth objectives and could result in us incurring excess costs and suffering deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting. We pay substantial fees and expenses to our Manager. These payments increase the risk that you will not earn a profit on your investment. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, we pay significant fees to our Manager. Those fees include a base management fee and an incentive fee, if earned. We will also reimburse our Manager for certain expenses pursuant to the Management Agreement. These payments increase the risk that you will not earn a profit on your investment. 
 28 

Table of Contents 
 The base management fee payable to our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement is payable regardless of the performance of our portfolio, which may reduce our Manager s incentive to devote the time and effort to seeking profitable investment opportunities for us. We pay our Manager a base management fee pursuant to the Management Agreement, which may be substantial, based on our total equity (as defined in the Management Agreement) regardless of the performance of our portfolio of properties. Our Manager s entitlement to non-performance-based compensation might reduce its incentive to seek profitable investment opportunities for us, which could result in a lower performance of our portfolio and materially adversely affect us. The incentive fee payable to our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement may cause our Manager to select investments in more risky assets to increase its incentive compensation. Our Manager has the ability to earn incentive fees based on our total stockholder return exceeding an 8 cumulative annual hurdle rate, which may create an incentive for our Manager to invest in properties with a purchase price reflecting a higher potential yield, that may be riskier or more speculative, or sell an investment prematurely for a gain, in an effort to increase our short-term gains and thereby increase our stock price and the incentive fees to which it is entitled. If our interests and those of our Manager are not aligned, the execution of our business plan and our results of operations could be adversely affected, which could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. There are conflicts of interest in our relationships with our Manager, which could result in outcomes that are not in our best interests. We are subject to conflicts of interest arising out of our relationships with our Manager. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, our Manager is obligated to supply us with our management team. However, our Manager is not obligated to dedicate any specific personnel exclusively to us, nor are the CTO personnel provided to us by our Manager obligated to dedicate any specific portion of their time to the management of our business. Additionally, our Manager is a wholly owned subsidiary of CTO. All of our executive officers are executive officers and employees of CTO and one of our executive officers (John P. Albright) is also a member of the board of directors of our company and the board of directors of CTO. As a result, our Manager and the CTO personnel it provides to us, including our executive officers, may have conflicts between their duties to us and their duties to CTO. In addition to our initial portfolio, we have in the past acquired and may in the future acquire or sell properties that would potentially fit the investment criteria for CTO or its affiliates. Similarly, CTO or its affiliates may acquire or sell properties that would potentially fit our investment criteria. Although such acquisitions or dispositions could present conflicts of interest, we nonetheless may pursue and consummate such transactions. Additionally, we may engage in transactions directly with CTO, our Manager or their affiliates. If we acquire a property from CTO or one of its affiliates or sell a property to CTO or one of its affiliates, the purchase price we pay to CTO or one of its affiliates or the purchase price paid to us by CTO or one of its affiliates may be higher or lower, respectively, than the purchase price that would have been paid to or by us if the transaction were the result of arm s length negotiations with an unaffiliated third party. In deciding whether to issue additional debt or equity securities, we will rely in part on recommendations made by our Manager. While such decisions are subject to the approval of the Board, our Manager is entitled to be paid a base management fee that is based on our total equity (as defined in the Management Agreement). As a result, our Manager may have an incentive to recommend that we issue additional equity securities at dilutive prices. If we issue additional equity securities at dilutive prices, the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected, and you could lose some or all of your investment in our common stock. All of our executive officers are executive officers and employees of CTO. These individuals and other CTO personnel provided to us through our Manager devote as much time to us as our Manager deems appropriate. However, our executive officers and other CTO personnel provided to us through our Manager may have conflicts in allocating their time and services between us, on the one hand, and CTO and its affiliates, on the other. During a period of prolonged economic weakness or another economic downturn affecting the real estate industry or at other times when we need focused support 
 29 

Table of Contents 
 and assistance from our Manager and the CTO executive officers and other personnel provided to us through our Manager, we may not receive the necessary support and assistance we require or that we would otherwise receive if we were self-managed. Our Manager s failure to identify and acquire properties that meet our investment criteria or perform its responsibilities under the Management Agreement could materially and adversely affect our business and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Our ability to achieve our objectives depends on, among other things, our Manager s ability to identify, acquire and lease properties that meet our investment criteria. Accomplishing our objectives is largely a function of our Manager s structuring of our investment process, our access to financing on acceptable terms and general market conditions. Our stockholders will not have input into our investment decisions. All of these factors increase the uncertainty, and thus the risk, of investing in our common stock. The CTO executive officers and other CTO personnel provided to us through our Manager have substantial responsibilities under the Management Agreement. In order to implement certain strategies, CTO, our Manager or their affiliates may need to hire, train, supervise and manage new employees successfully. Any failure by CTO or our Manager to manage our future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on us, our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Our Manager s liability is limited under the Management Agreement, and we have agreed to indemnify our Manager against certain liabilities. As a result, we could experience unfavorable operating results or incur losses for which our Manager would not be liable. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, our Manager will not assume any responsibility other than to render the services called for thereunder and will not be responsible for any action of the Board in following or declining to follow its directives. Our Manager maintains a contractual, as opposed to a fiduciary relationship, with us. Under the terms of the Management Agreement, our Manager, its officers, members and personnel, any person controlling or controlled by our Manager and any person providing sub-advisory services to our Manager will not be liable to us, any subsidiary of ours, our directors, our stockholders or any subsidiary s stockholders or partners for acts or omissions performed in accordance with and pursuant to the Management Agreement, except those resulting from acts constituting gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or reckless disregard of our Manager s duties under the Management Agreement. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify our Manager and each of its officers, directors, members, managers and employees from and against any claims or liabilities, including reasonable legal fees and other expenses reasonably incurred, arising out of or in connection with our business and operations or any action taken or omitted on our behalf pursuant to authority granted by the Management Agreement, except where attributable to gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or reckless disregard of such person s duties under the Management Agreement. As a result, we could experience unfavorable operating results or incur losses for which our Manager would not be liable. Termination of the Management Agreement could be difficult and costly, including as a result of payment of termination fees to our Manager, and may cause us to be unable to execute our business plan, which could materially and adversely affect us. If we fail to renew the Management Agreement, or terminate the agreement, other than for a termination for cause, we are obligated to pay our Manager a termination fee equal to three times the sum of (i) the average annual base management fee earned by our Manager during the 24-month period immediately preceding the most recently completed calendar quarter prior to the termination date and (ii) the average annual incentive fee earned by our Manager during the two most recently completed measurement periods (as defined in the Management Agreement) prior to the termination date. Such a payment would likely be a substantial one-time charge that could render unattractive, or not economically feasible, the termination of our Manager, even if it performed poorly. In addition, any termination of the Management Agreement would end our Manager s obligation to provide us with our executive officers and personnel upon whom we rely for the operation of our business and would also terminate our rights under the ROFO Agreement with CTO, as discussed further herein. As a result of termination of the ROFO Agreement, we would face increased competition from CTO and its affiliates, as well as others, for the acquisition of properties that meet our investment criteria, and our right to 
 30 

Table of Contents 
 acquire certain properties from CTO and its affiliates would be terminated. As a result, the termination of the Management Agreement could materially and adversely affect us. If our Manager ceases to be our manager pursuant to the Management Agreement, counterparties to our agreements may cease doing business with us. If our Manager ceases to be our manager, it could constitute an event of default or early termination event under financing and other agreements we may enter into in the future, upon which our counterparties may have the right to terminate their agreements with us. If our Manager ceases to be our manager for any reason, including upon the non-renewal of the Management Agreement, our business and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be materially adversely affected. The Management Agreement with our Manager and the ROFO Agreement with CTO were not negotiated on an arm s-length basis and may not be as favorable to us as if they had been negotiated with unaffiliated third parties. The Management Agreement with our Manager and the ROFO Agreement with CTO were negotiated between related parties and before our independent directors were elected, and their terms, including the fees payable to our Manager, may not be as favorable to us as if they had been negotiated with unaffiliated third parties. The terms of these agreements may not reflect our long-term best interests and may be overly favorable to CTO, our Manager and their affiliates (other than us and our subsidiaries). Further, we may choose not to enforce, or to enforce less vigorously, our rights under the Management Agreement and the ROFO Agreement because of our desire to maintain our ongoing relationships with our Manager and CTO. Risks Related to Our Financing Activities Our growth depends on external sources of capital, including debt financings, that are outside of our control and may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code, we are required, among other things, to distribute annually at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain. In addition, we are subject to income tax at the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income. Because of these distribution requirements, we may not have sufficient liquidity from our operating cash flows to fund future capital needs, including any acquisition financing. Consequently, we may rely on third-party sources, including lenders, to fund our capital needs. We may not be able to obtain debt financing on favorable terms or at all. Any additional debt we incur will increase our leverage and likelihood of default. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends, in part, on: general market conditions; the market s perception of our growth potential; our current debt levels; our current and expected future earnings; our cash flow and cash distributions; and the market price per share of our common stock. If we cannot obtain capital from third-party sources, we may not be able to acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities exist, meet the capital and operating needs of our existing properties, satisfy our debt service obligations or make the cash distributions to our stockholders necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT, which would materially and adversely affect us. Our organizational documents have no limitation on the amount of additional indebtedness that we may incur in the future. As a result, we may become highly leveraged in the future, which could materially and adversely affect us. We have entered into certain debt agreements and, in the future, we may incur additional indebtedness to finance future acquisitions and development, redevelopment and renovation projects and for general corporate purposes. There are 
 31 

Table of Contents 
 no restrictions in our charter or bylaws that limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that we may incur nor restrict the form in which our indebtedness will be incurred (including recourse or non-recourse debt or cross-collateralized debt). A substantial level of indebtedness in the future could have adverse consequences for our business and otherwise materially and adversely affect us because it could, among other things: require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including to pay dividends on our common stock as currently contemplated or necessary to satisfy the requirements for qualification as a REIT; increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; limit our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance indebtedness on favorable terms or at all to expand our business or ease liquidity constraints; and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have less indebtedness. The agreements governing our indebtedness are likely to place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, reducing our operational flexibility and creating risks associated with default and noncompliance. The agreements governing the Credit Facility and any other indebtedness that we may incur in the future contain or may contain covenants that place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. These covenants may restrict, among other activities, our and our subsidiaries ability to: merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our or our subsidiaries assets; sell, transfer, pledge or encumber our stock or the ownership interests of our subsidiaries; incur additional debt or issue preferred stock; make certain investments; make certain expenditures, including capital expenditures; pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock; and enter into certain transactions with affiliates. These covenants could impair our ability to grow our business, take advantage of attractive business opportunities or successfully compete. Our ability to comply with financial and other covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. A breach of any of these covenants or covenants under any other agreements governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default. Any cross-default provisions in our debt agreements could cause an event of default under one debt agreement to trigger an event of default under our other debt agreements. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our debt agreements, our lenders could elect to declare all outstanding debt under such agreements to be immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay or refinance the accelerated debt, our lenders could proceed against any assets pledged to secure that debt, including foreclosing on or requiring the sale of any properties securing that debt, and the proceeds from the sale of these properties may not be sufficient to repay such debt in full. Mortgage debt obligations expose us to the possibility of foreclosure, which could result in the loss of our investment in any property subject to mortgage debt. Future borrowings may be secured by mortgages on our properties. Incurring mortgage and other secured debt obligations increases our risk of losses because defaults on secured indebtedness may result in foreclosure actions initiated by lenders and ultimately our loss of the properties securing any loans for which we are in default. If we are in default under a cross-defaulted mortgage loan, we could lose multiple properties to foreclosure. For tax purposes, a foreclosure of any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage. If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property, we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure, but would not receive any cash proceeds, which could hinder our ability to meet the REIT distribution requirements imposed by the Code. As we execute our business plan, we may 
 32 

Table of Contents 
 assume or incur new mortgage indebtedness on our properties. Any default under any mortgage debt obligation we incur may increase the risk of our default on our other indebtedness, including indebtedness under our anticipated revolving credit facility, which could materially and adversely affect us. Increases in interest rates have and will likely continue to increase our interest costs on our variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt or sell assets. Current and future borrowings under our revolving credit facility will bear interest at variable rates. Recent increases in interest rates have increased our interest payments and reduced our cash flow available for other corporate purposes, and we expect this trend to continue in the near term. In addition, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance debt when it matures and increase interest costs on any debt that is refinanced. Further, an increase in interest rates could increase the cost of financing, thereby decreasing the amount third parties are willing to pay for our properties, which would limit our ability to dispose of properties when necessary or desired. In addition, we may enter into hedging arrangements in the future. Our hedging arrangements may include interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate hedging contracts. Our hedging arrangements could reduce, but may not eliminate, the impact of rising interest rates, and they could expose us to the risk that other parties to our hedging arrangements will not perform or that the agreements relating to our hedges may not be enforceable. The planned discontinuation of LIBOR may affect our financial results. The ICE Benchmark Administration IBA ), the administrator of LIBOR, ceased publication of USD LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for the one week and two month USD LIBOR tenors, and intends to cease publishing the remaining USD LIBOR tenors on June 30, 2023. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board (the ARRC has formally recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, as its preferred alternative replacement rate for LIBOR. There are significant differences between LIBOR and SOFR, such as LIBOR being an unsecured lending rate versus SOFR which is a secured lending rate, and SOFR being an overnight rate versus LIBOR which reflects term rates at different maturities. These and other differences create the potential for basis risk between the two rates. The impact of any basis risk between LIBOR and SOFR may negatively affect our operating results. Any of these alternative methods may result in interest rates that are higher than if LIBOR were available in its current form, which could have a material adverse effect on our results. It is uncertain at this time if the remaining tenors of USD LIBOR will cease to exist prior to June 30, 2023, or whether additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted, or whether alternative reference rates such as SOFR will gain market acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR. Although SOFR is the ARRC s recommended replacement rate, whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question. In addition, although certain of our LIBOR based obligations provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable on certain of our obligations if LIBOR is not reported, which include requesting certain rates from major reference banks in London or New York, or alternatively using LIBOR for the immediately preceding interest period or using the initial interest rate, as applicable, uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher than, lower than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the interest rates and/or payments that would have been made on our obligations if LIBOR rate was available in its current form. The Company converted from LIBOR to SOFR during the year ended December 31, 2022. Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure We are a holding company with no direct operations, and we will rely on funds received from the Operating Partnership to pay our obligations and make distributions to our stockholders. We are a holding company and will conduct substantially all of our operations through the Operating Partnership. We will not have, apart from an interest in the Operating Partnership, any independent operations. As a result, we will rely on distributions from the Operating Partnership to make any distributions we declare on shares of our common stock. We will also rely on distributions from the Operating Partnership to meet any of our obligations, including any tax liability on taxable income allocated to us from the Operating Partnership. In addition, because we are a holding company, your claims

 as stockholders are structurally subordinated to all existing and future creditors and preferred equity holders of the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. Therefore, in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or reorganization of the Operating Partnership or its subsidiaries, assets of the Operating Partnership or the applicable subsidiary will be available to satisfy our claims to us as an equity owner therein only after all of their liabilities and preferred equity have been paid in full. As of December 31, 2022, we owned 88.7 of the OP Units issued by the Operating Partnership. However, in connection with our future acquisition activities or otherwise, we may issue additional OP Units to third parties. Such issuances would reduce our ownership in the Operating Partnership. Certain provisions of Maryland law could inhibit changes in control of our company. Certain business combination and control share acquisition provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law, or the MGCL, may have the effect of deterring a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change in control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common stock. Pursuant to the MGCL, the Board has by resolution exempted business combinations between us and any other person. Our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the control share acquisition statute any and all acquisitions by any person of shares of our stock. However, there can be no assurance that these exemptions will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future. Our charter and bylaws and Maryland law also contain other provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interest. Certain provisions in the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership may delay, defer or prevent unsolicited acquisitions of us. Provisions in the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership may delay, defer or prevent unsolicited acquisitions of us or changes of our control. These provisions could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an unsolicited acquisition of us or change of our control, although some stockholders might consider such proposals, if made, desirable. These provisions include, among others: redemption rights of qualifying parties; transfer restrictions on OP Units; our ability, as general partner, in some cases, to amend the partnership agreement and to cause the Operating Partnership to issue units with terms that could delay, defer or prevent a merger or other change of control of us or the Operating Partnership without the consent of the limited partners; and the right of the limited partners to consent to transfers of the general partnership interest and mergers or other transactions involving us under specified circumstances. The partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership and Delaware law also contain other provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interest. Our charter contains stock ownership limits, which may delay, defer or prevent a change of control. In order for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT for each taxable year, no more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals during the last half of any calendar year, and at least 100 persons must beneficially own our stock during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate portion of a shorter taxable year. Individuals for this purpose include natural persons, private foundations, some employee benefit plans and trusts and some charitable trusts. To assist us in complying with these limitations, among other purposes, our charter generally prohibits any person from directly or indirectly owning more than 9.8 in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock. These ownership limitations could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of our common stock might receive a premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price or which holders might believe to be otherwise in their best interests.

 Our charter s constructive ownership rules are complex and may cause the outstanding shares owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. As a result, the acquisition of less than these percentages of the outstanding shares by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity to own constructively in excess of these percentages of the outstanding shares and thus violate the share ownership limits. Our charter also provides that any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock or preferred stock (if and when issued) in excess of the stock ownership limits without the consent of the Board or in a manner that would cause us to be closely held under Section 856(h) of the Code (without regard to whether the shares are held during the last half of a taxable year) will result in the shares being automatically transferred to a trustee for a charitable trust or, if the transfer to the charitable trust is not automatically effective to prevent a violation of the share ownership limits or the restrictions on ownership and transfer of our shares, any such transfer of our shares will be null and void. The Board may change our strategies, policies or procedures without stockholder consent, which may subject us to different and more significant risks in the future. Our investment, financing, leverage and distribution policies and our policies with respect to all other activities, including growth, debt, capitalization and operations, are determined by the Board. These policies may be amended or revised at any time and from time to time at the discretion of the board of directors without notice to or a vote of our stockholders. This could result in us conducting operational matters, making investments or pursuing different business or growth strategies than those contemplated. Under these circumstances, we may expose ourselves to different and more significant risks in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and growth. In addition, the Board may change our policies with respect to conflicts of interest, provided that such changes are consistent with applicable legal requirements. We may have assumed unknown liabilities in connection with the Formation Transactions, which, if significant, could materially and adversely affect us. As part of the Formation Transactions, we acquired our initial portfolio from CTO, subject to existing liabilities, some of which may have been unknown at the time of the IPO and may remain unknown. Unknown liabilities might include claims of tenants, vendors or other persons dealing with such entities prior to the IPO (that had not been asserted or threatened prior to the IPO), tax liabilities and accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business. Any unknown or unquantifiable liabilities that we assumed in connection with the Formation Transactions for which we have no or limited recourse could materially and adversely affect us. Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and executive officers are limited, which could limit your recourse in the event of actions not in your best interest. Our charter limits the liability of our present and former directors and executive officers to us and our stockholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted under Maryland law. Under current Maryland law, our present and former directors and executive officers will not have any liability to us or our stockholders for money damages other than liability resulting from (i) actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services or (ii) active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or executive officer that was established by a final judgment and is material to the cause of action. As a result, we and our stockholders have limited rights against our present and former directors and executive officers, which could limit your recourse in the event of actions not in your best interest. Conflicts of interest exist or could arise in the future between the interests of our stockholders and the interests of holders of Operating Partnership units, which may impede business decisions that could benefit our stockholders. Conflicts of interest exist or could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and the Operating Partnership or any partner thereof, on the other. Our directors and executive officers have duties to our company under applicable Maryland law in connection with their management of our company. At the same time, PINE GP, as the general partner of the Operating Partnership, has fiduciary duties and obligations to the Operating Partnership and its limited partners under Delaware law and the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership in connection with the management of the Operating Partnership. The fiduciary duties and obligations of the general partner to the Operating Partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and executive officers

 to our company. The Operating Partnership agreement provides that, in the event of a conflict between the interests of our stockholders on the one hand, and the limited partners of the Operating Partnership on the other hand, the general partner will endeavor in good faith to resolve the conflict in a manner not adverse to either our stockholders or the limited partners, provided however, that so long as we own a controlling interest in the Operating Partnership, any such conflict that the general partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, determines cannot be resolved in a manner not adverse to either our stockholders or the limited partners of the Operating Partnership are resolved in favor of our stockholders, and the general partner will not be liable for monetary damages for losses sustained, liabilities incurred or benefits not derived by the limited partners in connection with such decisions. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the partnership agreement will provide for the indemnification of the general partner and our officers, directors, employees and any other persons the general partner may designate from and against any and all claims that relate to the operations of the Operating Partnership as set forth in the partnership agreement in which any indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, unless it is established that: the act or omission of the indemnitee was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and either was committed in bad faith or was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty; the indemnitee actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services; or in the case of any criminal proceeding, the indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful. Similarly, the general partner of the Operating Partnership and our officers, directors, agents or employees, will not be liable for monetary damages to the Operating Partnership or the limited partners for losses sustained or liabilities incurred as a result of errors in judgment or mistakes of fact or law or of any act or omission so long as any such party acted in good faith. We could increase or decrease the number of authorized shares of stock, classify and reclassify unissued stock and issue stock without stockholder approval, which could prevent a change in our control and negatively affect the market price of our common stock. The Board, without stockholder approval, has the power under our charter to amend our charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we are authorized to issue, to authorize us to issue authorized but unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock and to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock into one or more classes or series of stock and set the terms of such newly classified or reclassified shares. As a result, we may issue series or classes of common stock or preferred stock with preferences, distributions, powers and rights, voting or otherwise, that are senior to the rights of holders of our common stock. Any such issuance could dilute our existing common stockholders interests. Although the Board has no such intention at the present time, it could establish a class or series of preferred stock that could, depending on the terms of such series, delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interest. The Operating Partnership has in the past and may in the future issue additional OP Units without the consent of our stockholders, which could have a dilutive effect on our stockholders. The Operating Partnership has in the past and may in the future issue additional OP Units to third parties without the consent of our stockholders, which would reduce our ownership percentage in the Operating Partnership and may have a dilutive effect on the amount of distributions made to us by the Operating Partnership and, therefore, the amount of distributions we may make to our stockholders. Any such issuances, or the perception of such issuances, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

 We are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies will make shares of our common stock less attractive to investors. We are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual gross revenue equals or exceeds 1.235 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (ii) December 31, 2024 (the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the IPO); (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt securities and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the Exchange Act. We intend to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to most other public companies, whether or not they are classified as emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, an exemption from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. An attestation report by our auditor would require additional procedures by them that could detect problems with our internal control over financial reporting that are not detected by management. If our system of internal control over financial reporting is not determined to be appropriately designed or operating effectively, it could require us to restate financial statements, cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could lead to a significant decline in the market price of our common stock. The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. However, we have chosen to opt out of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for all public companies that are not emerging growth companies. Our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable. We are also a smaller reporting company as defined in Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies. We may be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions and benefits under the JOBS Act. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active, liquid and/or orderly trading market for our common stock and the market price and trading volume of our common stock may be more volatile and decline significantly. We have incurred new costs as a result of becoming a public company, and such costs may increase when we cease to be an emerging growth company. As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. The expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. We expect compliance with these public reporting requirements and associated rules and regulations to increase expenses, particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company, although we are currently unable to estimate theses costs with any degree of certainty. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, which could result in our incurring additional costs applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies. Risks Related to Our Qualification and Operation as a REIT Failure to remain qualified as a REIT would cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for distributions to our stockholders. We believe that our organization and method of operation have enabled us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT and we intend to continue to be organized and operate in such a manner. However, we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a REIT. Moreover, our qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual annual operating results, certain qualification tests set forth in the U.S.

 federal income tax laws. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that our actual results of operations for any particular taxable year will satisfy such requirements. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for distributions to our stockholders because: we would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates; we could be subject to increased state and local taxes; and unless we are entitled to relief under certain U.S. federal income tax laws, we could not re-elect REIT status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we failed to qualify as a REIT. In addition, if we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will no longer be required to make distributions. As a result of all these factors, our failure to remain qualified as a REIT could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and it would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common stock. Even if we remain qualified as a REIT, we may face other tax liabilities that could reduce our cash flows and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. Even if we remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income, tax on income from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure and state or local income, property and transfer taxes. In addition, under partnership audit procedures, the Operating Partnership and any other partnership that we may form or acquire may be liable at the entity level for tax imposed under those procedures. Further, any taxable REIT subsidiaries TRSs that we may form in the future will be subject to regular corporate U.S. federal, state and local taxes. Moreover, several provisions of the Code regarding the arrangements between a REIT and its TRS entities function to ensure that such TRS entities are subject to an appropriate level of U.S. federal income taxation. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distributions to stockholders, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common stock. Failure to make required distributions would subject us to U.S. federal corporate income tax. We intend to continue to operate in a manner so as to maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally are required to distribute at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain, each year to our stockholders. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement but distribute less than 100 of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which dividends we pay in a calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income, 95 of our capital gain net income and, 100 of our undistributed income (as defined under the excise tax rules from prior years). Complying with REIT requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments. To maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. In order to meet these tests, we may be required to forego investments we might otherwise make. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our performance. In particular, we must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75 of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified real estate assets. The remainder of our investment in securities (other than government securities, securities of TRSs and qualified real estate assets) generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities 
 38 

Table of Contents 
 of any one issuer. In addition, in general, no more than 5 of the value of our assets (other than government securities, securities of TRSs and qualified real estate assets) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, no more than 20 of the value of our total assets can be represented by the securities of one or more TRSs and no more than 25 of our assets can be represented by debt of publicly offered REITs (i.e., REITs that are required to file annual and periodic reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act), unless secured by real property or interests in real property. If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. As a result, we may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments. These actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. The relative lack of experience of our Manager in operating under the constraints imposed on us as a REIT may hinder the achievement of our investment objectives. The Code imposes numerous constraints on the operations of REITs that do not apply to other investment vehicles. Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet requirements regarding our organization and ownership, distributions of our income, the nature and diversification of our income and assets and other tests imposed by the Code. Any failure to comply could cause us to fail to satisfy the requirements associated with qualifying for and maintaining REIT status. Our Manager has relatively limited experience operating under these constraints, which may hinder our ability to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and to achieve our investment objectives. As a result, we cannot assure you that our Manager will be able to operate our business under these constraints. If we fail to qualify as a REIT for any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates. In addition, we would generally be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year of losing our REIT status. Losing our REIT status would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability. In addition, distributions to stockholders would no longer qualify for the dividends paid deduction, and we would no longer be required to make distributions. If this occurs, we might be required to borrow funds or liquidate some investments in order to pay the applicable tax. Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities. The REIT provisions of the Code may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities. Any income from a hedging transaction we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes, price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets, if properly identified under applicable Treasury Regulations, does not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests applicable to REITs. In addition, certain income from hedging transactions entered into to hedge existing hedging positions after any portion of the hedged indebtedness or property is extinguished or disposed of will not be included in income for purposes of the 75 and 95 gross income tests. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions will likely be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a TRS. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRSs would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear. In addition, losses in a TRS generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward against future taxable income of such TRS. Our ability to provide certain services to our tenants may be limited by the REIT rules or may have to be provided through a TRS. As a REIT, we generally cannot provide services to our tenants other than those that are customarily provided by landlords, nor can we derive income from a third party that provides such services. If we forego providing such services to our tenants, we may be at a disadvantage to competitors that are not subject to the same restrictions. However, we can provide such non-customary services to tenants or share in the revenue from such services if we do so through a TRS, though income earned by such TRS will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax.

 The prohibited transactions tax may limit our ability to dispose of our properties. A REIT s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100 tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. We may be subject to the prohibited transaction tax equal to 100 of net gain upon a disposition of real property. Although a safe harbor to the characterization of the sale of real property by a REIT as a prohibited transaction is available, we cannot assure you that we can comply with the safe harbor or that we will avoid owning property that may be characterized as held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Consequently, we may choose not to engage in certain sales of our properties or may conduct such sales through any TRS that we may form, which would be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax. We may pay taxable dividends in our common stock and cash, in which case stockholders may sell shares of our common stock to pay tax on such dividends, placing downward pressure on the market price of our common stock. We may satisfy the 90 distribution test with taxable distributions of our common stock. The Internal Revenue Service IRS has issued Revenue Procedure 2017-45 authorizing elective cash/stock dividends to be made by publicly offered REITs. Pursuant to Revenue Procedure 2017-45, the IRS will treat the distribution of stock pursuant to an elective cash/stock dividend as a distribution of property under Section 301 of the Code (i.e., a dividend), as long as at least 20 of the total dividend is available in cash and certain other parameters detailed in the Revenue Procedure are satisfied. If we made a taxable dividend payable in cash and common stock, taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, stockholders may be required to pay income tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends received. If a U.S. stockholder sells the common stock that it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our common stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to certain non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in common stock. If we made a taxable dividend payable in cash and our common stock and a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, it may put downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. We do not currently intend to pay taxable dividends using both our common stock and cash, although we may choose to do so in the future. The ability of the Board to revoke our REIT qualification without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders. Our charter provides that the Board may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our stockholders, if it determines in good faith that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we cease to qualify as a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our taxable income to our stockholders, which may have adverse consequences on our total return to our stockholders. Any ownership of a TRS we may form in the future will be subject to limitations and our transactions with a TRS will cause us to be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain income or deductions if those transactions are not conducted on arm s-length terms. Overall, no more than 20 of the value of a REIT s assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRS entities. A TRS will be subject to applicable U.S. federal, state and local corporate income tax on its taxable income, and its after tax net income will be available for distribution to us but is not required to be distributed to us. In addition, several provisions of the Code regarding the arrangements between a REIT and its TRS entities function to ensure that the TRS is subject to an appropriate level of U.S. federal income taxation. The Code also imposes a 100 excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm s-length basis. We will monitor the value of our respective investments in any TRS that we may form for the purpose of ensuring compliance with TRS ownership limitations and will structure our transactions with any TRS on terms that we believe are arm s length to avoid 
 40 

Table of Contents 
 incurring the 100 excise tax described above. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the 20 limitation or to avoid application of the 100 excise tax. You may be restricted from acquiring or transferring certain amounts of our common stock. The stock ownership restrictions of the Code for REITs and the 9.8 share ownership limit in our charter may inhibit market activity in our capital stock and restrict our business combination opportunities. In order for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT, five or fewer individuals, as defined in the Code, may not own, beneficially or constructively, more than 50 in value of our issued and outstanding capital stock at any time during the last half of a taxable year. Attribution rules in the Code determine if any individual or entity beneficially or constructively owns our shares of capital stock under this requirement. Additionally, at least 100 persons must beneficially own our shares of capital stock during at least 335 days of each taxable year other than our initial REIT taxable year. To help ensure that we meet these tests, our charter restricts the acquisition and ownership of shares of our capital stock. Our charter, with certain exceptions, requires our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT. Unless exempted by the Board, our charter prohibits any person from beneficially or constructively owning more than 9.8 in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our shares of capital stock. The Board may not grant an exemption from this restriction to any person if such exemption would result in our failing to qualify as a REIT. This as well as other restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply, however, if the Board determines in good faith that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a REIT. Dividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends. The maximum U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income payable to U.S. stockholders that are taxed at individual rates is 20 (plus the 3.8 surtax on net investment income, if applicable). Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the reduced rates on qualified dividend income. However, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2026, ordinary REIT dividends constitute qualified business income and thus a 20 deduction is available to individual taxpayers with respect to such dividends, resulting in a 29.6 maximum U.S. federal income tax rate (plus the 3.8 surtax on net investment income, if applicable) for individual U.S. stockholders. However, to qualify for this deduction, the stockholder receiving such dividends must hold the dividend-paying REIT stock for at least 46 days (taking into account certain special holding period rules) of the 91-day period beginning 45 days before the stock becomes ex-dividend, and cannot be under an obligation to make related payments with respect to a position in substantially similar or related property. The more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are taxed at individual rates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including our common stock. We may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes, in each instance with potentially retroactive effect, that could reduce the market price of our common stock. At any time, the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs, or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended. We cannot predict when or if any new U.S. federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing U.S. federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective and any such law, regulation or interpretation may take effect retroactively. We and our stockholders could be adversely affected by any such change in the U.S. federal income tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

 If the Operating Partnership failed to qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences. We believe that the Operating Partnership will be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including us, will be allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, its share of the Operating Partnership s income. We cannot assure you, however, that the IRS will not challenge the status of the Operating Partnership or any other subsidiary partnership in which we own an interest as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the Operating Partnership or any such other subsidiary partnership as an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs and, accordingly, we would likely cease to qualify as a REIT. Also, the failure of the Operating Partnership or any subsidiary partnership to qualify as a partnership could cause such partnership to become subject to U.S. federal and state corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners, including us. Risks Related to Our Common Stock The market value of our common stock is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility. As with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our common stock depends on various factors, which may change from time to time and/or may be unrelated to our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. These factors may cause significant fluctuations or volatility in the market price of our common stock. These factors include, but are likely not limited to, the following: our financial condition and operating performance and the financial condition or performance of other similar companies; actual or anticipated differences in our quarterly or annual operating results than expected; changes in our revenues, Funds From Operations FFO ), Adjusted Funds From Operations AFFO ), or earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts; publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry generally; increases in market interest rates, which may lead investors to demand a higher distribution yield for shares of our common stock, and could result in increased interest expense on our debt; adverse market reaction to any increased indebtedness we incur in the future; actual or anticipated changes in our and our tenants businesses or prospects, including as a result of the impact of a global pandemic, such as the COVID-19 Pandemic; the current state of the credit and capital markets, and our ability and the ability of our tenants to obtain financing on favorable terms; conflicts of interest with CTO and its affiliates, including our Manager; the termination of our Manager or additions and departures of key personnel of our Manager; increased competition in our markets; strategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business or growth strategies; the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us or our industry; adverse speculation in the press or investment community; actions by institutional stockholders; the extent of investor interest in our securities; the general reputation of REITs and the attractiveness of our equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate-based companies; investor confidence in the stock and bond markets, generally; changes in tax laws; equity issuances by us (including the issuances of OP Units), or common stock resales by our stockholders, or the perception that such issuances or resales may occur;

 volume of average daily trading and the amount of our common stock available to be traded; changes in accounting principles; failure to maintain our qualification as a REIT; failure to comply with the rules of the NYSE or maintain the listing of our common stock on the NYSE; terrorist acts, natural or man-made disasters, including global pandemics impacting the United States, or threatened or actual armed conflicts; and general market and local, regional and national economic conditions, including factors unrelated to our operating performance and prospects. No assurance can be given that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future or that holders of shares of our common stock will be able to sell their shares when desired on favorable terms, or at all. From time to time in the past, securities class action litigation has been instituted against companies following periods of extreme volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources. There can be no assurance that we will be able to make or maintain cash distributions, and certain agreements relating to our indebtedness may, under certain circumstances, limit or eliminate our ability to make distributions to our common stockholders. We intend to make cash distributions to our stockholders in amounts such that all or substantially all of our taxable income in each year, subject to adjustments, is distributed. Our ability to continue to make distributions in the future may be adversely affected by the risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We can give no assurance that we will be able to make or maintain distributions and certain agreements relating to our indebtedness may, under certain circumstances, limit or eliminate our ability to make distributions to our common stockholders. We can give no assurance that rents from our properties will increase, or that future acquisitions of real properties or other investments will increase our cash available for distributions to stockholders. In addition, any distributions will be authorized at the sole discretion of the Board, and their form, timing and amount, if any, will depend upon a number of factors, including our actual and projected results of operations, FFO, AFFO, liquidity, cash flows and financial condition, the revenue we actually receive from our properties, our operating expenses, our debt service requirements, our capital expenditures, prohibitions and other limitations under our financing arrangements, our REIT taxable income, the annual REIT distribution requirements, applicable law and such other factors as the Board deems relevant. If we do not have sufficient cash available for distributions, we may need to fund the shortage out of working capital or borrow to provide funds for such distributions, which would reduce the amount of proceeds available for real estate investments and increase our future interest costs. Our inability to make distributions, or to make distributions at expected levels, could result in a decrease in the per share trading price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock could be adversely affected by our level of cash distributions. We believe the market price of the equity securities of a REIT is based primarily upon the market s perception of the REIT s growth potential, its current and potential future cash distributions, whether from operations, sales or refinancing, and its management and governance structure and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets. For that reason, our common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than our net asset value per share. To the extent we retain operating cash flows for investment purposes, working capital reserves or other purposes, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not correspondingly increase the market price of our common stock. If we fail to meet the market s expectations with regard to future operating results and cash distributions, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. Increases in market interest rates may result in a decline in the market price of our common stock. One of the factors that we believe influences the market price of our common stock is the distribution yield on the common stock (as a percentage of the market price of our common stock) relative to market interest rates. Additional increases in market interest rates, which have increased recently but are still currently at low levels relative to certain historical rates, may lead prospective purchasers of shares of our common stock to expect a higher distribution yield.

 Additionally, higher interest rates have in the past and are expected to continue to increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease our cash available for distribution. Thus, higher market interest rates could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Future issuances of debt securities, which would rank senior to shares of our common stock upon our liquidation, and future issuances of equity securities (including preferred stock and OP Units), which would dilute the holdings of our then-existing common stockholders and may be senior to shares of our common stock for the purposes of making distributions, periodically or upon liquidation, may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the future, we may issue debt or equity securities or incur other borrowings. Upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and other loans and shares of our preferred stock will receive a distribution of our available assets before holders of shares of our common stock. We are not required to offer any debt or equity securities to existing stockholders on a preemptive basis. Therefore, shares of our common stock that we issue in the future, directly or through convertible or exchangeable securities (including OP Units), warrants or options, will dilute the holdings of our then-existing common stockholders and such issuances or the perception of such issuances may reduce the market price of our common stock. Our preferred stock, if issued, would likely have a preference on distribution payments, periodically or upon liquidation, which could limit our ability to make distributions to holders of shares of our common stock. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities or otherwise incur debt in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, nature or impact of our future capital raising efforts. Thus, holders of shares of our common stock bear the risk that our future issuances of debt or equity securities or our incurrence of other borrowings may materially and adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock and dilute their ownership in us. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets or the perception that they might occur, could reduce the price of our common stock and may dilute the voting power of our then-existing common stockholders and such common stockholders ownership interest in us. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for our then-existing common stockholders to sell their shares of common stock at a time and price that such common stockholders deem appropriate. The shares of our common stock that we sold in the IPO may be resold immediately in the public market unless they are held by affiliates, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. The common stock purchased by CTO in the CTO Private Placement and in the IPO and the shares of common stock underlying the OP Units issued in the Formation Transactions are restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act and may not be sold in the absence of registration under the Securities Act unless an exemption from registration is available, including the exemptions contained in Rule 144. As a result of the registration rights agreement that we entered into with CTO, the shares of our common stock purchased by CTO in the CTO Private Placement may be eligible for future sale without restriction. Sales of a substantial number of such shares, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to fall or make it more difficult for our then-existing common stockholders to sell their common stock at a time and price that such common stockholders deem appropriate. In addition, our charter provides that we may issue up to 500,000,000 shares of common stock and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, 0.01 par value per share. Moreover, under Maryland law and as is provided in our charter, a majority of our entire board of directors will have the power to amend our charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we are authorized to issue without stockholder approval. Future issuances of shares of our common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock may dilute the ownership interest of our common stockholders. Because our decision to issue additional equity or convertible or exchangeable securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future issuances. In addition, we are not required to offer any such securities to existing stockholders on a preemptive basis. Therefore, it may not be possible for existing stockholders to participate in such future issuances, which may dilute the existing stockholders interests in us.

 Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic The COVID-19 Pandemic, and the future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases, could materially and adversely impact or disrupt our tenant s business operations and as a result adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance. Since late December 2019, the COVID-19 Pandemic has spread globally, including every state in the United States. The COVID-19 Pandemic has had, and other future pandemics could have, repercussions across regional and global economies and financial markets. The outbreak of COVID-19 Pandemic and its variants have significantly adversely impacted global economic activity and produced significant volatility in the global financial markets. The global impact of the outbreak rapidly evolved and, as cases of COVID-19 have continued to be identified in additional countries, many countries, including the United States, reacted by instituting quarantines, mandating business and school closures and restricting travel. Certain states and cities, including where we own properties, also reacted by instituting quarantines, restrictions on travel, shelter at home rules, and importantly, restrictions on the types of business that may continue to operate or requiring others to shut down completely. Additional states and cities may implement similar restrictions. As a result, the COVID-19 Pandemic has negatively impacted most every industry directly or indirectly. A number of our tenants have announced temporary closures of their stores and requested deferral, or in some instances, rent abatement while the pandemic remains. The COVID-19 Pandemic, or a future pandemic, could have material and adverse effects on our ability to successfully operate our business and as a result our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows due to, among other factors: a complete or partial closure of, or other operational issues at, one or more of our properties resulting from government or tenant action; the reduced economic activity severely impacts our tenants businesses, financial condition and liquidity and may cause one or more of our tenants to be unable to meet their obligations to us in full, or at all, or to otherwise seek modifications of such obligations; the reduced economic activity could result in a recession, which could negatively impact consumer discretionary spending; difficulty accessing debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all, and a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions may affect our access to capital necessary to fund business operations on a timely basis; a general decline in business activity and demand for real estate transactions could adversely affect our ability or desire to grow our portfolio of properties; a deterioration in our or our tenants ability to operate in affected areas or delays in the supply of products or services to us or our tenants from vendors that are needed for our or our tenants efficient operations could adversely affect our operations and those of our tenants; and the potential negative impact on the health of our Manager s personnel, particularly if a significant number of them are impacted, could result in a deterioration in our ability to ensure business continuity during a disruption. The extent to which the COVID-19 Pandemic impacts our operations, and those of our tenants, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty, including the scope, severity and duration of the COVID-19 Pandemic, and the impact of actions taken by governmental and health organizations to contain the COVID-19 Pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic and containment measures, among others. Additional closures by our tenants of their businesses and early terminations by our tenants of their leases could reduce our cash flows, which could impact our ability to continue paying dividends to our stockholders at expected levels, or at all. The rapid onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the continued uncertainty of its duration and long-term impact precludes any prediction of the magnitude of the adverse impact on the U.S. economy, our tenant s businesses and ours. Consequently, the COVID-19 Pandemic presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to our business operations, our Manager s business, and therefore, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Further, many risk factors set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, should be interpreted as heightened risks as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.

 General Risk Factors Cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents could adversely affect our business and disrupt operations. Cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. The result of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, disrupted operations, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation and reputational damage. Should any such cyber incidents or similar events occur, our assets, particularly cash, could be lost and, as a result, our ability to execute our business and pursue our investment and growth strategy could be impaired, thereby materially and adversely affecting us. We may become subject to litigation, which could materially and adversely affect us. We may become subject to litigation, our operations, other securities offerings and otherwise in the ordinary course of business. Some of these claims may result in significant defense costs and potentially significant judgments against us, some of which are not, or cannot be, insured against. We generally intend to vigorously defend ourselves. However, we cannot be certain of the ultimate outcomes of any claims that may arise in the future and which are presently not known to us. Resolution of these types of matters against us may result in our having to pay significant fines, judgments or settlements, which, if uninsured, or if the fines, judgments and settlements exceed insured levels, could materially and adversely impact our earnings and cash flows, thereby materially and adversely affecting us. Certain litigation or the resolution of certain litigation may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage, which could materially and adversely impact us, expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured and materially and adversely impact our ability to attract directors and officers. If we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, we may not be able to meet applicable reporting requirements, which could materially and adversely affect us. As a publicly traded company, we are subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act and are required to file reports and other information with the SEC. In addition, we are required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file with, or submit to, the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. They include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed with, or submitted to, the SEC is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Effective disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable reports, effectively prevent and detect fraud and to operate successfully as a public company. Designing and implementing effective disclosure controls and procedures is a continuous effort that requires significant resources and devotion of time. We may discover deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures that may be difficult or time consuming to remediate in a timely manner. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures or to timely effect any necessary improvements thereto could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations (which could affect the listing of our common stock on the NYSE). Additionally, ineffective disclosure controls and procedures could also adversely affect our ability to prevent or detect fraud, harm our reputation and cause investors to lose confidence in our reports filed with, or submitted to, the SEC, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. Changes in accounting standards may materially and adversely affect us. From time to time, the FASB and the SEC, who create and interpret appropriate accounting standards, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that will govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes could materially and adversely affect our reported financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in restating prior period financial statements. Similarly, these changes could materially and adversely affect our tenant s reported financial condition or results of operations and affect their preferences regarding leasing real estate.

 We are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility. Our business faces public scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance ESG activities. We risk damage to our reputation if we or affiliates of our Manager fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as diversity and inclusion, environmental stewardship, support for local communities, corporate governance and transparency and considering ESG factors in our investment processes. Adverse incidents with respect to ESG activities could impact the cost of our operations and relationships with investors, all of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, new legislative or regulatory initiatives related to ESG could adversely affect our business. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our principal offices are located at 369 N. New York Avenue., Suite 201, Winter Park, Florida 32789. Our telephone number is (407) 904-3324. As of December 31, 2022, the Company owns 148 net leased retail and office buildings located in 34 states (refer to Item 1. Business ). ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, the Company may be a party to certain legal proceedings, incidental to the normal course of our business. We are not currently a party to any pending or threatened legal proceedings that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER REPURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES The Company s common stock trades on the NYSE under the symbol PINE . As of February 2, 2023, there were 112 holders of record of our common stock. This figure does not represent the actual number of beneficial owners of our common stock because shares of our common stock are frequently held in street name through banks, brokers and others for the benefit of beneficial owners who may vote the shares. We intend to make quarterly distributions to our common stockholders. In particular, in order to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we intend to make annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. However, any future distributions will be at the sole discretion of the Board and will depend upon, among other things, our actual results of operations and liquidity. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities There were no unregistered sales of equity securities during the year ended December 31, 2022, which were not previously reported. ITEM 6. [Reserved]

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements When we refer to we, us, our, PINE, or the Company, we mean Alpine Income Property Trust, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. References to Notes to Financial Statements refer to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Alpine Income Property Trust, Inc. included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Also, when the Company uses any of the words anticipate, assume, believe, estimate, expect, intend, or similar expressions, the Company is making forward-looking statements. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon present expectations and reasonable assumptions, the Company s actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Certain factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those the Company anticipates or projects are described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any document incorporated herein by reference. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Overview Alpine Income Property Trust, Inc. is a Maryland corporation that conducts its operations so as to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Substantially all of the operations are conducted through our Operating Partnership. We seek to acquire, own and operate primarily freestanding, commercial real estate properties located in the United States leased primarily pursuant to triple-net, long-term leases. We focus on investments primarily in retail properties. We target tenants in industries that we believe are favorably impacted by current macroeconomic trends that support consumer spending, such as strong and growing employment and positive consumer sentiment, as well as tenants in industries that have demonstrated resistance to the impact of the growing e-commerce retail sector or who use a physical presence as a component of their omnichannel strategy. We also seek to invest in properties that are net leased to tenants that we determine have attractive credit characteristics, stable operating histories and healthy rent coverage levels, are well-located within their respective markets and have rents at-or-below market rent levels. Furthermore, we believe that the size of our company allows us, for at least the near term, to focus our investment activities on the acquisition of single properties or smaller portfolios of properties that represent a transaction size that most of our publicly-traded net lease REIT peers will not pursue on a consistent basis. Our strategy for investing in income-producing properties is focused on factors including, but not limited to, long-term real estate fundamentals, including those markets experiencing significant economic growth. We employ a methodology for evaluating targeted investments in income-producing properties which includes an evaluation of: (i) the attributes of the real estate (e.g., location, market demographics, comparable properties in the market, etc.); (ii) an evaluation of the existing tenant(s) (e.g., credit-worthiness, property level sales, tenant rent levels compared to the market, etc.); (iii) other market-specific conditions (e.g., tenant industry, job and population growth in the market, local economy, etc.); and (iv) considerations relating to the Company s business and strategy (e.g., strategic fit of the asset type, property management needs, alignment with the Company s structure, etc.). Our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2022 were in-line with our expectations and primarily driven by our investment activity of acquiring net lease properties at valuations and yields generally consistent with our target investment parameters.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures Our reported results are presented in accordance with GAAP. We also disclose FFO and AFFO, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these two non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs. FFO and AFFO do not represent cash generated from operating activities and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements; accordingly, they should not be considered alternatives to net income as a performance measure or cash flows from operations as reported on our statement of cash flows as a liquidity measure and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. We compute FFO in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude extraordinary items (as defined by GAAP), net gain or loss from sales of depreciable real estate assets, impairment write-downs associated with depreciable real estate assets and real estate related depreciation and amortization, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. To derive AFFO, we modify the NAREIT computation of FFO to include other adjustments to GAAP net income related to non-cash revenues and expenses such as loss on extinguishment of debt, amortization of above- and below-market lease related intangibles, straight-line rental revenue, amortization of deferred financing costs, non-cash compensation, and other non-cash income or expense. Such items may cause short-term fluctuations in net income but have no impact on operating cash flows or long-term operating performance. We use AFFO as one measure of our performance when we formulate corporate goals. FFO is used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains or losses on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. We believe that AFFO is an additional useful supplemental measure for investors to consider because it will help them to better assess our operating performance without the distortions created by other non-cash revenues or expenses. FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures (in thousands, except share data):

The 0.8 million increase is primarily attributable to growth in the Company s equity base, which led to an increase in management fee expense of 0.6 million. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense totaled 23.5 million and 15.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The 7.6 million increase in the depreciation and amortization expense is reflective of the Company s expanded property portfolio. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled 9.5 million and 3.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The 5.8 million increase in interest expense is attributable to the higher average outstanding debt balance during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021, as well as increasing rates on the Company s variable rate Credit Facility indebtedness. The overall increase in the Company s long-term debt was primarily utilized to fund the acquisition of properties during 2022 and 2021. Net Income Net income totaled 34.0 million and 11.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in net income is attributable to the factors described above in addition to the 24.1 million increase in gain on disposition of assets during the year ended December 31, 2022. The increased gain on disposition of assets is the result of more disposition activity during the year ended December 31, 2022, with proceeds from such dispositions being reinvested into income properties through the like-kind exchange structure. The increase in gain on disposition of assets was partially offset by the 0.7 million loss on extinguishment of debt incurred during the year ended December 31, 2022, incurred as a result of the write off of unamortized loan costs in connection with the CBMS Loan defeasance and the termination of the Prior Revolving Credit Facility, as hereinafter defined in Note 9, Long-Term Debt .

Cash totaled 13.0 million at December 31, 2022, including restricted cash of 4.0 million which is being held in an escrow account to be reinvested through the like-kind exchange structure into other income properties. Long-Term Debt. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 181.8 million available on the Credit Facility. See Note 9, Long-Term Debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for the Company s disclosure related to its long-term debt balance at December 31, 2022.

A s noted previously, the Company acquired 51 properties during the year ended December 31, 2022 for an aggregate purchase price of 187.4 million, as further described in Note 3 Property Portfolio in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.

We believe we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, capital requirements, maintenance, and debt service requirements over the next twelve months and into the foreseeable future, with cash on hand, cash flow from our operations and 181.8 million of available capacity on the existing 250.0 million Credit Facility, based on our current borrowing base of properties, as of December 31, 2022. The Board and management consistently review the allocation of capital with the goal of providing the best long-term return for our stockholders. These reviews consider various alternatives, including increasing or decreasing regular dividends, repurchasing the Company s securities, and retaining funds for reinvestment. Annually, the Board reviews our business plan and corporate strategies, and makes adjustments as circumstances warrant. Management s focus is to continue our strategy of investing in net leased properties by utilizing the capital we raise and available borrowing capacity

 from the Credit Facility to increase our portfolio of income-producing properties, providing stabilized cash flows with strong risk-adjusted returns primarily in larger metropolitan areas and growth markets. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates include those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations. Our most significant estimate is as follows: Purchase Accounting for Acquisitions of Real Estate Subject to a Lease . As required by GAAP, the fair value of the real estate acquired with in-place leases is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and tenant improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases, the value of in-place leases, and the value of leasing costs, based in each case on their relative fair values. In allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded as other assets or liabilities based on the present value. The assumptions underlying the allocation of relative fair values are based on market information including, but not limited to: (i) the estimate of replacement cost of improvements under the cost approach, (ii) the estimate of land values based on comparable sales under the sales comparison approach, and (iii) the estimate of future benefits determined by either a reasonable rate of return over a single year s net cash flow, or a forecast of net cash flows projected over a reasonable investment horizon under the income capitalization approach. The underlying assumptions are subject to uncertainty and thus any changes to the allocation of fair value to each of the various line items within the Company s consolidated balance sheets could have an impact on the Company s financial condition as well as results of operations due to resulting changes in depreciation and amortization as a result of the fair value allocation. The acquisitions of real estate subject to this estimate totaled 51 properties for a combined purchase price of 187.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 68 properties for a combined purchase price of 260.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. See Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , for further discussion of the Company s accounting estimates and policies. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a result, pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA The Company s Consolidated Financial Statements appear beginning on page F-1 of this report. See Item 15 of this report. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE There have been no disagreements with our accountants on accounting and financial disclosures. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation, as required by rules 13(a)-15 and 15(d)-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the design and operation of the

Table of Contents 
 Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and our CFO, we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our assessment and those criteria, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

NONCONTROLLING INTEREST As of December 31, 2022, CTO holds, directly and indirectly, an noncontrolling ownership interest in the Operating Partnership as a result of OP Units issued to CTO at the time of the Company s IPO. An additional noncontrolling ownership interest is held by an unrelated third party in connection with the issuance of OP Units as consideration for a portfolio of net lease properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2021. DIVIDENDS The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Code. To qualify as a REIT, the Company must annually distribute, at a minimum, an amount equal to of its taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and must distribute of its taxable income (including net capital gains) to eliminate U.S. federal corporate income taxes payable by the Company. Because taxable income differs from cash flow from operations due to non-cash revenues and expenses (such as depreciation and other items), in certain circumstances, the Company may generate operating cash flow in excess of its dividends, or alternatively, may need to make dividend payments in excess of operating cash flows. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company declared and paid cash dividends on its common stock and OP Units of per share, per share, and per share, respectively.

During the term of the ROFO Agreement, CTO will not, and will cause each of its affiliates (which for purposes of the ROFO Agreement will not include our company and our subsidiaries) not to, acquire, directly or indirectly, a single-tenant, net leased property, unless CTO has notified us of the opportunity and we have affirmatively rejected the opportunity to acquire the applicable property or properties.

Exhibit 4.1 DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK The following is a summary of the material terms of our securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act and provisions of our charter and bylaws. The summary is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the charter and bylaws, each of which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this exhibit is a part. The following also summarizes certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the MGCL and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the MGCL. General Pursuant to our charter, we are currently authorized to designate and issue up to 500,000,000 shares of common stock, 0.01 par value per share (our common stock ), and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, 0.01 par value per share (our preferred stock ). A majority of our entire board of directors has the power, without stockholder approval, to amend our charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we are authorized to issue. Description of Common Stock General Our charter provides that we have authority to issue up to 500,000,000 shares of common stock. Under Maryland law, stockholders generally are not liable for a corporation s debts or obligations solely as a result of their status as stockholders. Distribution, Liquidation and Other Rights Stockholders are entitled to receive distributions when authorized by our board of directors and declared by us out of assets legally available for the payment of dividends. Stockholders are also entitled to share ratably in our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders in the event of our liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, after payment of, or adequate provision for, all of our known debts and liabilities. These rights are subject to the preferential rights of any other class or series of our stock, including any shares of preferred stock we may issue, and to the provisions of our charter regarding restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock. See Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer. Our common stockholders have no preference, conversion, exchange, sinking fund or redemption rights and have no preemptive rights to subscribe for any of our capital stock. Our charter provides that our stockholders generally have no appraisal rights unless our board of directors determines that appraisal rights will apply to one or more transactions in which our common stockholders would otherwise be entitled to exercise such rights. Subject to our charter restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock, holders of shares of our common stock have equal dividend, liquidation and other rights. Voting Rights Subject to our charter restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock and the terms of any other class or series of our stock, each outstanding share of our common stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors. Cumulative voting in the election of directors is not permitted. Directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the meeting in which directors are being elected and at which a quorum is present. This means that the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock can effectively elect all of the directors then standing for election, and the holders of the remaining shares will not be able to elect any directors. 

 Power to Classify and Reclassify Unissued Stock Our charter authorizes our board of directors to reclassify any unissued shares of our common stock into other classes or series of stock, including classes or series of preferred stock, and to establish the designation and number of shares of each such class or series and to set, subject to the provisions of our charter regarding the restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock, the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of each such class or series. Thus, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of shares of common stock or preferred stock with terms and conditions which could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or that our common stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interests. Listing Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol PINE. Transfer Agent and Registrar The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Computershare Trust Company, N.A. Certain Provisions of Maryland Law and of Our Charter and Bylaws Our Board of Directors Under our charter and bylaws, the number of directors of our company may be established, increased or decreased only by a majority of our entire board of directors but may not be fewer than the minimum number required under the MGCL (which is one) nor, unless our bylaws are amended, more than 15. Removal of Directors Our charter provides that, subject to the rights of holders of one or more classes or series of preferred stock to elect or remove one or more directors, a director may be removed only for cause (as defined in our charter) and only by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors. Business Combinations Under the MGCL, certain business combinations (including a merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange or, in certain circumstances specified under the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities) between a Maryland corporation and any interested stockholder, or an affiliate of such an interested stockholder, are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Maryland law defines an interested stockholder as: any person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10 or more of the voting power of the corporation s outstanding voting stock; or an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10 or more of the voting power of the then-outstanding voting stock of the corporation. 
 A person is not an interested stockholder under the MGCL if the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested stockholder. In approving a transaction, the board of directors may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of the approval, with any terms and conditions determined by it. 
 2 

 After such five-year period, any such business combination must be recommended by the board of directors of the corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least: 80 of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation; and two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom (or with whose affiliate) the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder. 
 These supermajority approval requirements do not apply if, among other conditions, the corporation s common stockholders receive a minimum price (as defined in the MGCL) for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares. These provisions of the MGCL do not apply, however, to business combinations that are approved or exempted by a corporation s board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. As permitted by the MGCL, our board of directors has adopted a resolution exempting any business combination between us and any other person from the provisions of this statute. Consequently, the five-year prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to business combinations involving us. As a result, any person will be able to enter into business combinations with us that may not be in the best interests of our stockholders, without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the statute. However, our board of directors may repeal or modify this resolution at any time in the future, in which case the applicable provisions of the MGCL will become applicable to business combinations between us and interested stockholders. Control Share Acquisitions The MGCL provides that a holder of control shares of a Maryland corporation acquired in a control share acquisition has no voting rights with respect to those shares except to the extent approved by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by stockholders entitled to exercise or direct the exercise of the voting power in the election of directors generally but excluding: (1) the person who has made or proposes to make the control share acquisition; (2) any officer of the corporation; or (3) any employee of the corporation who is also a director of the corporation. Control shares are voting shares of stock that, if aggregated with all other such shares of stock previously acquired by the acquirer or in respect of which the acquirer is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges: one-tenth or more but less than one-third; one-third or more but less than a majority; or a majority or more of all voting power. 
 Control shares do not include shares that the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval. A control share acquisition means the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of ownership of, or the power to direct the exercise of voting power with respect to, issued and outstanding control shares, subject to certain exceptions. A person who has made or proposes to make a control share acquisition, upon satisfaction of certain conditions (including an undertaking to pay expenses and making an acquiring person statement as described in the MGCL), may compel the board of directors of the company to call a special meeting of stockholders to be held within 50 days of demand to consider the voting rights of the control shares. If no request for a special meeting is made, the corporation may itself present the question at any stockholders meeting. 
 3 

 If voting rights of control shares are not approved at the meeting or if the acquiring person does not deliver an acquiring person statement as required by the statute, then, subject to certain conditions and limitations, the corporation may redeem any or all of the control shares (except those for which voting rights have previously been approved) for fair value determined, without regard to the absence of voting rights for the control shares, as of the date of the last control share acquisition by the acquirer or, if a meeting of stockholders at which the voting rights of such shares are considered and not approved is held, as of the date of such meeting. If voting rights for control shares are approved at a stockholders meeting and the acquirer becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares entitled to vote, all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights. The fair value of the shares as determined for purposes of such appraisal rights may not be less than the highest price per share paid by the acquirer in the control share acquisition. The control share acquisition statute does not apply (1) to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or statutory share exchange if the corporation is a party to the transaction or (2) to acquisitions approved or exempted by the charter or bylaws of the corporation. Our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the control share acquisition statute any and all control share acquisitions by any person of shares of our stock. There can be no assurance that such provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future by our board of directors. Subtitle 8 Subtitle 8 of Title 3 of the MGCL permits a Maryland corporation with a class of equity securities registered under the Exchange Act and at least three independent directors to elect, by provision in its charter or bylaws or a resolution of its board of directors and notwithstanding any contrary provision in the charter or bylaws, to be subject to any or all of the following five provisions: a classified board; a two-thirds vote requirement for removing a director; a requirement that the number of directors be fixed only by vote of the directors; a requirement that a vacancy on the board be filled only by a vote of the remaining directors (whether or not they constitute a quorum) and for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred and until a successor is elected and qualifies; or a majority requirement for the calling of a special meeting of stockholders. 
 Our charter provides that, effective at such time as we are able to make a Subtitle 8 election, vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by the remaining directors (whether or not they constitute a quorum) and that a director elected by the board of directors to fill a vacancy will serve for the remainder of the full term of the directorship. We have not elected to be subject to any of the other provisions of Subtitle 8, including the provisions that would permit us to classify our board of directors without stockholder approval. Moreover, our charter provides that, without the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter by stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, we may not elect to be subject to any of these additional provisions of Subtitle 8. Through provisions in our charter and bylaws unrelated to Subtitle 8, we (1) vest in our board of directors the exclusive power to fix the number of directors, (2) require, unless called by our chairman, our chief executive officer, our president or our board of directors, the request of stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting to call a special meeting of stockholders and (3) provide that a director may be removed only for cause and by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors. 
 4 

 Amendments to Our Charter and Bylaws Except as described herein and as provided in the MGCL, amendments to our charter must be advised by our board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of our stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Our board of directors has the power to amend or repeal any provision of our bylaws and to adopt new bylaws. In addition, our stockholders may amend or repeal any provision of our bylaws and adopt new bylaw provisions if any such amendment, repeal or adoption is approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Meetings of Stockholders Under our bylaws and pursuant to Maryland law, annual meetings of stockholders will be held each year at a date and at the time and place determined by our board of directors. Special meetings of stockholders may be called by our board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors, our president or our chief executive officer. Additionally, subject to the provisions of our bylaws, special meetings of the stockholders to act on any matter must be called by our secretary upon the written request of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on such matter at such meeting who have requested the special meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in, and provided the information and certifications required by, our bylaws. Only matters set forth in the notice of the special meeting may be considered and acted upon at such a meeting. Our secretary will inform the requesting stockholders of the reasonably estimated cost of preparing and delivering the notice of meeting (including our proxy materials), and the requesting stockholder must pay such estimated cost before our secretary may prepare and deliver the notice of the special meeting. Corporate Opportunities Our charter provides that, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, each of CTO Realty Growth, Inc., a Maryland corporation CTO ), its affiliates, each of their representatives, and each of our directors or officers who is also an officer, employee, agent, affiliate or designee of CTO or any of CTO s affiliates has the right to, and has no duty not to, (x) directly or indirectly engage in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us, including those deemed to be competing with us, or (y) directly or indirectly do business with any of our clients, customers or suppliers. In the event that CTO or any of its affiliates or employees, or any of their representatives or designees, acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter that may be a corporate opportunity for us, CTO, its affiliates and employees and any of their representatives or designees shall have no duty to communicate or present such corporate opportunity to us or any of our affiliates and shall not be liable to us or any of our affiliates, subsidiaries, stockholders or other equity holders for breach of any duty by reason of the fact that CTO or any of its affiliates or employees, or any of their representatives or designees, directly or indirectly, pursues or acquires such opportunity for themselves, directs such opportunity to another person, or does not present such opportunity to us or any of our affiliates; provided, however, that such corporate opportunity is not presented to such person in his or her capacity as a director or officer of us. Charter Amendments and Extraordinary Transactions Under Maryland law, a Maryland corporation generally cannot dissolve, amend its charter, merge, sell all or substantially all of its assets, convert into another form of entity, engage in a statutory share exchange or engage in similar transactions unless such transaction is declared advisable by the board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter unless a lesser percentage (but not less than a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter) is set forth in the corporation s charter. Our charter provides for approval of these matters by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on such matter, except that the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote on such matter is required to amend the provisions of our charter relating to the removal of directors or the vote required to amend the removal provisions. Maryland law also permits a corporation to transfer all or substantially all of its assets without the approval of its stockholders to an entity all of the equity interests of which are owned, directly or indirectly, by the corporation. Because our operating assets may be held by our operating partnership subsidiary or its wholly-owned subsidiaries, these subsidiaries may be able to merge or transfer all or substantially all of their assets without the approval of our stockholders.

 Advance Notice of Director Nominations and New Business Our bylaws provide that: with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders, nominations of individuals for election to our board of directors and the proposal of business to be considered by stockholders at the annual meeting may be made only: pursuant to our notice of the meeting; by or at the direction of our board of directors; or by a stockholder who was a stockholder of record at the record date set by the board of directors for the meeting, at the time of giving of the notice of the meeting and at the time of the annual meeting (and any postponement or adjustment thereof), who is entitled to vote at the meeting in the election of each individual so nominated or on such other business and who has complied with the advance notice procedures set forth in, and provided the information and certifications required by, our bylaws; and with respect to special meetings of stockholders, only the business specified in our company s notice of meeting may be brought before the special meeting of stockholders, and nominations of individuals for election to our board of directors may be made only: by or at the direction of our board of directors; or provided that the special meeting has been called in accordance with our bylaws for the purpose of electing directors, by any stockholder who is a stockholder of record at the record date set by the board of directors for the special meeting, at the time of giving of the notice required by our bylaws and at the time of the meeting (and any postponement or adjustment thereof), who is entitled to vote at the meeting in the election of each individual so nominated and who has complied with the advance notice provisions set forth in, and provided the information and certifications required by, our bylaws. 
 The purpose of requiring stockholders to give advance notice of nominations and other proposals is to afford our board of directors and our stockholders the opportunity to consider the qualifications of the proposed nominees or the advisability of the other proposals and, to the extent considered necessary by our board of directors, to inform stockholders and make recommendations regarding the nominations or other proposals. Although our bylaws do not give our board of directors the power to disapprove timely stockholder nominations and proposals, our bylaws may have the effect of precluding a contest for the election of directors or proposals for other action if the proper procedures are not followed, and of discouraging or deterring a third party from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors to our board of directors or to approve its own proposal. Anti-takeover Effect of Certain Provisions of Maryland Law and of Our Charter and Bylaws The restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock discussed below, the supermajority vote required to remove directors, our election to be subject to the provision of Subtitle 8 vesting in our board of directors the exclusive power to fill vacancies on our board of directors, and the advance notice provisions of our bylaws could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control of our company. Likewise, if our board of directors were to elect to be subject to the business combination provisions of the MGCL or if the provision in our bylaws opting out of the control share acquisition provisions of the MGCL were amended or rescinded, these provisions of the MGCL could have similar anti-takeover effects.

 Further, a majority of our entire board of directors has the power to increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of stock or the number of shares of any class or series of stock that we are authorized to issue, to classify and reclassify any unissued shares of our stock into other classes or series of stock and to authorize us to issue the newly classified shares, as discussed under the captions Description of Capital Stock General and Description of Capital Stock Description of Common Stock Power to Classify and Reclassify Unissued Stock, and could authorize the issuance of shares of common stock or another class or series of stock, including a class or series of preferred stock, that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us. These actions may be taken without stockholder approval unless such approval is required by applicable law, the terms of any other class or series of our stock or the rules of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which any of our stock is listed or traded. We believe that the power of our board of directors to increase or decrease the number of authorized shares of stock and to classify or reclassify unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock and thereafter to cause us to issue such shares of stock will provide us with increased flexibility in structuring possible future financings and acquisitions and in meeting other needs which might arise. Our charter and bylaws also provide that the number of directors may be established only by our board of directors, which prevents our stockholders from increasing the number of our directors and filling any vacancies created by such increase with their own nominees. The provisions of our bylaws discussed above under the captions Meetings of Stockholders and Advance Notice of Director Nominations and New Business require stockholders seeking to call a special meeting, nominate an individual for election as a director or propose other business at an annual or special meeting to comply with certain notice and information requirements. We believe that these provisions will help to assure the continuity and stability of our business strategies and policies as determined by our board of directors and promote good corporate governance by providing us with clear procedures for calling special meetings, information about a stockholder proponent s interest in us and adequate time to consider stockholder nominees and other business proposals. However, these provisions, alone or in combination, could make it more difficult for our stockholders to remove incumbent directors or fill vacancies on our board of directors with their own nominees and could delay, defer or prevent a change in control, including a proxy contest or tender offer that might involve a premium price for our common stockholders or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. Exclusive Forum Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Baltimore Division, will be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any Internal Corporate Claim, as such term is defined in the MGCL, (b) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf other than actions arising under the federal securities laws, (c) any action asserting a claim of breach of any duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or to our stockholders, (d) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the MGCL or our charter or bylaws or (e) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Limitation of Liability and Indemnification of Directors and Officers Maryland law permits a Maryland corporation to include in its charter a provision limiting the liability of its directors and officers to the corporation and its stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty that is established by a final judgment and is material to the cause of action. Our charter contains such a provision that eliminates such liability to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. The MGCL requires a Maryland corporation (unless its charter provides otherwise, which our charter does not) to indemnify a director or officer who has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she is made or threatened to be made a party by reason of his or her service in that capacity. The MGCL permits a Maryland corporation to indemnify its present and former directors and officers, among others, against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses actually incurred by them in connection with any proceeding to which they may be made or are threatened to be made a party by reason of their service in those or other capacities unless it is established that: 
 7 

 the act or omission of the director or officer was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and: 
 o was committed in bad faith; or o was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty; 
 the director or officer actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services; or in the case of any criminal proceeding, the director or officer had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful. 
 However, under the MGCL, a Maryland corporation may not indemnify a director or officer for an adverse judgment in a suit by or on behalf of the corporation or if the director or officer was adjudged liable on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received, unless, in either case, a court orders indemnification and then only for expenses. A court may order indemnification if it determines that the director or officer is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification, even though the director or officer did not meet the prescribed standard of conduct or was adjudged liable on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received. In addition, the MGCL permits a Maryland corporation to advance reasonable expenses to a director or officer upon the corporation s receipt of: a written affirmation by the director or officer of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the corporation; and a written undertaking, which may be unsecured, by the director or officer or on the director s or officer s behalf to repay the amount paid if it shall ultimately be determined that the standard of conduct has not been met. 
 Our charter obligates us, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law in effect from time to time, to indemnify and to pay or reimburse reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding without requiring a preliminary determination of the director s or officer s ultimate entitlement to indemnification to: any present or former director or officer who is made or threatened to be made a party to or witness in the proceeding by reason of his or her service in that capacity; or any individual who, while a director or officer of our company and at our request, serves or has served as a director, officer, partner, member, manager, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation, real estate investment trust, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or any other enterprise and who is made or threatened to be made a party to or witness in the proceeding by reason of his or her service in that capacity. 
 Our charter also permits us, with the approval of our board of directors, to indemnify and advance expenses to any person who served a predecessor of ours in any of the capacities described above and to any employee or agent of our company or a predecessor of our company. Indemnification Agreements We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers that obligate us to indemnify them to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law as discussed above under Certain Provisions of Maryland Law and of Our Charter and Bylaws Limitation of Liability and Indemnification of Directors and Officers. The indemnification agreements provide that, if a director or executive officer is a party to, or witness in, or is threatened to be made a party to, or witness in, any proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director, officer, employee or agent of our company or as a director, officer, partner, member, manager, fiduciary, employee, agent or trustee of any other foreign or domestic corporation, real estate investment trust, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise that he or she is or was serving in such capacity at our request, or the request of our external manager, we must indemnify the director or executive officer for all expenses and liabilities actually and reasonably incurred by him or her, or on his or her behalf, to the maximum extent permitted under Maryland law, including in any proceeding brought by the director or executive officer to enforce his or her rights under the indemnification agreement, to the extent provided by the agreement. The indemnification agreements also require us to advance reasonable expenses incurred by the indemnitee within ten days of the receipt by us of a statement from the indemnitee requesting the advance, provided the statement evidences the expenses and is accompanied or preceded by: 
 8 

 a written affirmation of the indemnitee s good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification; and a written undertaking, which may be unsecured, by the indemnitee or on his or her behalf to repay the amount paid if it shall ultimately be established that the standard of conduct has not been met. 
 The indemnification agreements also provide for procedures for the determination of entitlement to indemnification, including requiring such determination be made by independent counsel after a change of control of us. REIT Qualification Our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our election to be taxed as a real estate investment trust REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, without approval of our stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT. Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer For us to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT for each taxable year commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2020, our shares of stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. Also, not more than 50 of the value of our outstanding shares of stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2020. Because our board of directors believes it is at present essential for us to qualify as a REIT, our charter, subject to certain exceptions, restricts the amount of our shares of stock that a person may beneficially or constructively own. Our charter provides that, subject to certain exceptions, no person may beneficially or constructively own more than 9.8 in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock. Our charter also prohibits any person from (i) beneficially owning shares of our capital stock to the extent that such beneficial ownership would result in our being closely held within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code (without regard to whether the ownership interest is held during the last half of the taxable year), (ii) transferring shares of our capital stock to the extent that such transfer would result in shares of our capital stock being beneficially owned by less than 100 persons (determined under the principles of Section 856(a)(5) of the Code), (iii) beneficially or constructively owning shares of our capital stock to the extent such beneficial or constructive ownership would cause us to constructively own 10 or more of the ownership interests in a tenant (other than a taxable REIT subsidiary (as defined in Section 856(l) of the Code)) of our real property within the meaning of Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code or (iv) beneficially or constructively owning or transferring shares of our capital stock if such ownership or transfer would otherwise cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. Any person who acquires or attempts or intends to acquire beneficial or constructive ownership of shares of our capital stock that will or may violate any of the foregoing restrictions on transferability and ownership, or any person who would have owned shares of our capital stock that resulted in a transfer of shares of our capital stock to a charitable trust, is required to give written notice immediately to us, or in the case of a proposed or attempted transaction, to give at least 15 days prior written notice, and provide us with such other information as we may request in order to determine the effect of such transfer on our qualification as a REIT. The foregoing restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT. 
 9 

 Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may prospectively or retroactively exempt a person from the limits described above and may establish or increase an excepted holder percentage limit for such person. The person seeking an exemption must provide to our board of directors such representations, covenants and undertakings as our board of directors may deem appropriate in order to conclude that granting the exemption will not cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. Our board of directors may not grant such an exemption to any person if such exemption would result in our failing to qualify as a REIT. Our board of directors may require a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or an opinion of counsel, in either case in form and substance satisfactory to the board of directors, in its sole discretion, in order to determine or ensure our status as a REIT. Any attempted transfer of shares of our capital stock which, if effective, would violate any of the restrictions described above will result in the number of shares causing the violation (rounded up to the nearest whole share) to be automatically transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more charitable beneficiaries, except that any transfer that results in the violation of the restriction relating to shares of our capital stock being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons will be void ab initio . In either case, the proposed transferee will not acquire any rights in such shares. The automatic transfer will be deemed to be effective as of the close of business on the business day prior to the date of the purported transfer or other event that results in the transfer to the trust. Shares held in the trust will be issued and outstanding shares. The proposed transferee will not benefit economically from ownership of any shares held in the trust, will have no rights to dividends or other distributions and will have no rights to vote or other rights attributable to the shares held in the trust. The trustee of the trust will have all voting rights and rights to dividends or other distributions with respect to shares held in the trust. These rights will be exercised for the exclusive benefit of the charitable beneficiary. Any dividend or other distribution paid prior to our discovery that shares have been transferred to the trust will be paid by the recipient to the trustee upon demand. Any distribution authorized but unpaid will be paid when due to the trustee. Any dividend or other distribution paid to the trustee will be held in trust for the charitable beneficiary. Subject to Maryland law, the trustee will have the authority (i) to rescind as void any vote cast by the proposed transferee prior to our discovery that the shares have been transferred to the trust and (ii) to recast the vote in accordance with the desires of the trustee acting for the benefit of the charitable beneficiary. However, if we have already taken irreversible corporate action, then the trustee will not have the authority to rescind and recast the vote. Within 20 days of receiving notice from us that shares of our capital stock have been transferred to the trust, the trustee will sell the shares to a person designated by the trustee, whose ownership of the shares will not violate the above ownership and transfer limitations. Upon the sale, the interest of the charitable beneficiary in the shares sold will terminate and the trustee will distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the proposed transferee and to the charitable beneficiary as follows. The proposed transferee will receive the lesser of (i) the price paid by the proposed transferee for the shares or, if the proposed transferee did not give value for the shares in connection with the event causing the shares to be held in the trust (e.g., a gift, devise or other similar transaction), the market price (as defined in our charter) of the shares on the day of the event causing the shares to be held in the trust and (ii) the price received by the trustee (net of any commission and other expenses of sale) from the sale or other disposition of the shares. The trustee may reduce the amount payable to the proposed transferee by the amount of dividends or other distributions paid to the proposed transferee and owed by the proposed transferee to the trustee. Any net sale proceeds in excess of the amount payable to the proposed transferee will be paid immediately to the charitable beneficiary. If, prior to our discovery that shares of our capital stock have been transferred to the trust, the shares are sold by the proposed transferee, then (i) the shares shall be deemed to have been sold on behalf of the trust and (ii) to the extent that the proposed transferee received an amount for the shares that exceeds the amount he or she was entitled to receive, the excess shall be paid to the trustee upon demand. In addition, shares of our capital stock held in the trust will be deemed to have been offered for sale to us, or our designee, at a price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that resulted in the transfer to the trust (or, in the case of a devise or gift, the market price at the time of the devise or gift) and (ii) the market price on the date we, or our designee, accept the offer, which we may reduce by the amount of dividends and distributions paid to the proposed transferee and owed by the proposed transferee to the trustee. We will have the right to accept the offer until the trustee has sold the shares. Upon a sale to us, the interest of the charitable beneficiary in the shares sold will terminate and the trustee will distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the proposed transferee. 
 10 

 If a transfer to a charitable trust, as described above, would be ineffective for any reason to prevent a violation of a restriction, the transfer that would have resulted in such violation will be void ab initio , and the proposed transferee shall acquire no rights in such shares. Every owner of more than 5 (or such lower percentage as required by the Code or the regulations promulgated thereunder) of shares of our capital stock, within 30 days after the end of each taxable year, is required to give us written notice, stating his or her name and address, the number of shares of each class and/or series of our stock that he or she beneficially owns and a description of the manner in which the shares are held. Each such owner must provide us with such additional information as we may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of his or her beneficial ownership on our status as a REIT and to ensure compliance with the ownership limits. In addition, each stockholder will upon demand be required to provide us with such information as we may request in order to determine our status as a REIT and to comply with the requirements of any taxing authority or governmental authority or to determine such compliance and to ensure compliance with the ownership limit. These ownership limitations could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.
