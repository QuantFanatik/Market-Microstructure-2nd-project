The Company s e-learning programs are offered
to its customers who have to be first registered as a member of Force Club. Since 2002, the Company began to offer its e-learning programs
to its customers in CD-ROMs with pre-loaded learning content until 2007. Due to the popular trend for internet, starting from 2007, the
Company has made its e-learning programs available on its website for its customers, and the customers need to pay a monthly fee in order
to access and view the most up-to-date content on the website of the Company. At the advent of digital technology in recent years and
in view of the increasing popularity of tablet devices, the Company has released its e-learning programs on smartphones and tablet devices
for customer use since 2012 to cater for the popular demand of young learners and users in rural areas of Japan. The e-learning programs
of Force Club are targeted at residents of Japan, and thus the e-learning programs are presented in Japanese only and no translated version
is available. Since 2015, in addition to e-learning, the Company has started offline business which attracts public attentions such as
Abacus School and Robot Programming School. The Company also opened ixi After School in Tokyo, which provides after school
care services to children. Through these offline businesses, the Company has provided services to general users. 

The Company regularly updates its e-learning materials
and programs. In particular, the learning resources supplementing elementary school, junior high school and senior high school curriculum
would be overhauled to correspond to any revision in school curriculum, which generally takes place once in a four-year period. In addition,
most of preparation courses for the university entrance examinations and professional qualification examinations would be revised at
one to two year intervals to cater for any changes to the examination syllabus. The website of the Company is updated from time to time
to reflect the updates and changes to the learning materials and programs and for users with smartphones and tablet devices, these updates
can also be downloaded from the website of the Company.

Business Model 

Apart from using a conventional direct sales marketing
strategy, the Company has also adopted multilevel marketing MLM ), via the Premium Membership in the Force Club, in operating
its businesses. 

Since 2002, the Company has adopted a direct sales
marketing strategy to market its e-learning programs. Subsequently, in 2007, the Company gradually changed its marketing strategy from
direct sales to MLM for the purposes of (i) establishing its brand name and penetrating into the rural areas of Japan; (ii) promoting
its products to wider customer groups through premium members; and (iii) incentivizing premium members to recruit new members to join
Force Club in order to increase the sales of its products and maximize profits for the Company. Currently, the Company has no retail
shops or other point-of-sale for its products (e-learning courses). 

MLM was adopted by the Company in order to expand
the sales of its e-learning programs through its Force Club members. There are two tiers of Force Club members, namely standard members
and premium members. Among Force Club members, premium members get a tablet device which entitles the premium members to life-time access
of all of the Company s e-learning educational content. Since the Company s e-learning education programs are distributed
in the form of online downloads, it can be used both online and offline. 

Force Club Membership 

Force Club members are those who intend to use products and services the
Company offers. There are three tiers of Force Club members, namely standard members, support members and premium members. Premium members
are those who wish to engage in recruiting new members Premium Members ). 

Premium Members have to join a premium plan under which members are given
rights to use all products and services of the Company, and engage in activities to recruit new Force Club members and obtain monetary
rewards and bonuses (special income or commissions) from such activities. The Company enters into a contract (the Premium Member

Payments an applicant who wishes to be a Force Club
Premium Member has to join the premium plan and pay an initial payment of JPY420,000 (exclusive of sales tax), comprising: 

(i) The one-off registration fee of JPY10,000; 

 (ii) The premium package fee of JPY390,000; and 

 (iii)An advanced payment of monthly membership fees for the
initial two months amounting to JPY20,000. 

Support members pay a lower fee for the access to
educational content and will receive promotional materials which is substantially lesser in scale as compared to that to a premium member. The
support member has the choice to become a premium member by making relevant premium member registration and purchasing the upgrade pack
from the Company. 

Standard members pay the same registration fee, but
a reduced monthly rate and no premium package fee. Monthly membership fees payable from the third month onwards will be automatically
transmitted from a member s bank account until termination of membership. 

Based on provisions described fully in the Premium
Member Contract there are fees related to, but not exclusively limited to, cancellation of membership and other stipulations pursuant
to certain actions. If a Premium Member does not pay the monthly membership fee before the prescribed due date, such Premium Member will
be disqualified and will not be paid any commission with respect to his/her recruitment performance in the preceding month, and Force
Club services for such Premium Member will be suspended in the following month. The commission and Force Club services for such Premium
Member will be resumed in the subsequent month if the monthly membership fee is paid within three months from the due date. Otherwise,
the Premium Member is deemed to have withdrawn from his membership if the monthly membership fee is not paid for three consecutive months
after the payment due date. 

In addition, the Premium Member Contract sets out
the rules of conduct required to be observed by Premium Members in recruiting new members to join Force Club. The Company is entitled
to suspend a Premium Member s business activities, suspend his or her commission, demand return of commission(s), remove his or
her title, or terminate his or her membership if such Premium Member violates or infringes the rules of conduct or other related laws
or regulations, and/or acts in a way that is offensive to public order and morals. 

Upon registration as Force Club members, applicants
will be given a user ID to gain access to the e-learning programs through Force Club platform. Force Club members will be given additional

Co., Ltd., which provides Study Supplements , JustSystem Corporation, which provides Smile Zemi , Benesse Corporation
which provides Challenge Touch and SuRaLa Net Co., Ltd. which provides SuRaLa , whose product offerings are also
consistent of e-learning programs and services. 

Current Advertising 

Our advertising expenses are primarily comprised
of, but not limited to, sales events hosted for sales agents, exhibitions to promote and display company product offerings, signboards,
and public relations activities. 

Future Plans 

During the
year under review, economic activity in Japan gradually returned to normal as the coronavirus disease Covid-19 pandemic
situation has become under control and social distancing measures were eased. Due to the relaxation of these restrictions, the Company
was able to resume conducting its business activities, resulting in a significant increase in the number of members and a growth in sales
and profit. 

Over the
next twelve months, the Company intends to focus on expanding its sales network to strengthen its business activities. Since the year
under review has led to an increased number of members, we expect a stable growth in monthly membership fee income for the coming financial
year.

The number of the employees of the Company, and all
subsidiaries, as of the filing date is thirty-seven. All thirty-seven employees are considered full-time employees. We do not presently
have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing, or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt plans in the

Holders 

Currently, as of the date of this report, and as
of our fiscal year end, there are approximately 60 shareholders of record of our common stock and 32,700,000 shares of common stock deemed
issued and outstanding.

Item 7. Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021,
we had cash in the amount of 23,822,217 and 23,056,242, respectively. The increase in cash is mainly attributed to increase in net
income from operation and accounts payable. The accounts payable were mainly unpaid commissions to the Force Club premium members and
these payments were completed as of the date of this report. Currently, our cash balance is sufficient to fund our operations without
the need for additional funding. 

Revenues 

We recorded revenue of 34,690,411 for the year ended
September 30, 2022 as opposed to 28,433,822 for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in revenue, in our opinion, is attributed
to an increase in recruitment activities of the Force Club premium members. 

Net income 

We recorded net income of 4,138,347 for the year
ended September 30, 2022 as opposed to 3,074,544 for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in net income is attributed to
an increase in revenue. 

Cash flow 

For the year ended September 30, 2022, we had cash
flows from operations in the amount of 6,759,449 as opposed to 5,257,817 for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in operating
cash flow, in our opinion, is mainly attributed to an increase in net income, adjusted by changes in accrued expenses and other payables,
account payable and income tax payable, offset by the cash outflow resulting from changes in fair value of marketable securities and
inventories. 

Working capital 

As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, we had working
capital of 15,273,484 and 15,695,158, respectively. 

Advertising 

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included
in selling and distributions expenses. Advertising expenses were 1,493,824 and 736,195 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. 

Advertising expenses were comprised of, but not limited
to, sales events hosted for sales agents, exhibitions to promote and display company product offerings, signboards, and public relations
activities. 

Future Plans 

During the
year under review, economic activity in Japan gradually returned to normal as the coronavirus disease Covid-19 pandemic
situation has become under control and social distancing measures were eased. Due to the relaxation of these restrictions, the Company
was able to resume conducting its business activities, resulting in a significant increase in the number of members and a growth in sales

Over the
next twelve months, the Company intends to focus on expanding its sales network to strengthen its business activities. Since the year
under review has led to an increased number of members, we expect a stable growth in monthly membership fee income for the coming financial
year. 

Impact of COVID-19 

It is expected
that Japan's economy will recover and the Company will be able to continue conducting its business activities without restrictions. However,
due to the high uncertainty of the evolving situation, the Company has limited visibility on the full impact brought upon by the COVID-19
pandemic, and the related financial impact to future periods cannot be estimated at this time.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 

 Exceed World, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Exceed World, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021,
and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), shareholders equity, and cash flows for
the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were
we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures
to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising
from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee
and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

income in the opening balance. 

The Company does not have any contract asset. 

and for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. 

Advertising expenses were comprised of, but not limited

and , consisting of current portion of 2,509,602 and 846,766, and deferred portion
of 14,322 and 45,124, respectively. 

Japan 

The Company conducts its major businesses in Japan
and e-Learning and e-Communications Japanese Subsidiaries are subject to tax in this jurisdiction. As a result of its
business activities, Japanese Subsidiaries file tax returns that are subject to examination by the local tax authority. 

Open tax years in Japan are five years. As of September
30, 2022, the Company s earliest open tax year for Japanese income tax purposes is its fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. The
Company's tax attributes from prior periods remain subject to adjustment. 

Hong Kong 

Force Holdings, a direct wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company in Hong Kong, is engaged in investment holding. Hong Kong profits tax has been provided at the rate of 16.5 on the estimated
assessable profit arising in Hong Kong. 

No provision for the Hong Kong profits tax has been
made as Force Holdings did not generate any estimated assessable profits in Hong Kong during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. 

Open tax year in Hong Kong is six years after the
relevant year of assessment. This may be extended to ten years in the case of fraud of willful evasion of taxes. There are no provisions
that govern the time limit for tax collection. 

United States 

Exceed World, Inc., which acts as a holding company
on a non-consolidated basis, does not plan to engage any business activities and current or future loss will be fully allowed. For the
years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, Exceed World, Inc., as a holding company registered in the state of Delaware, has incurred net
loss and, therefore, has no tax liability. The net deferred tax asset generated by the loss carry forward has been fully reserved. 

The Company is a Delaware corporation that is subject
to U.S. corporate income tax on its taxable income at a rate of up to 21 for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. Recent
U.S. federal tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Act ), was signed into law on
December 22, 2017. The 2017 Act significantly modified the U.S. Internal Revenue Code by, among other things, reducing the statutory
U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017; limiting and/or eliminating
many business deductions; migrating the U.S. to a territorial tax system with a one-time transition tax on a mandatory deemed repatriation
of previously deferred foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries; subject to certain limitations, generally eliminating U.S. corporate
income tax on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; and providing for new taxes on certain foreign earnings. Taxpayers may elect to pay
the one-time transition tax over eight years or in a single lump sum. 

The 2017 Act also includes provisions for a new tax
on the Global Intangible Low-taxed Income GILTI effective for tax years of foreign corporations beginning after December
31, 2017. The GILTI provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of controlled foreign corporations CFCs ), subject to the possible use of foreign tax credits and a deduction equal to 50 percent to offset the income tax
liability, subject to some limitations. The Company elected to account for GILTI tax in the period the tax is incurred, and no provision
is made during the year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. 

To the extent that portions of the Company s
U.S. taxable income, such as Subpart F income or GILTI, are determined to be from sources outside of the U.S., subject to certain limitations,
the Company may be able to claim foreign tax credits to offset its U.S. income tax liabilities. If dividends that the Company receives
from its subsidiaries are determined to be from sources outside of the U.S., subject to certain limitations, the Company will generally
not be required to pay U.S. corporate income tax on those dividends. Any liabilities for U.S. corporate income tax will be accrued in
the Company s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and estimated tax payments will be made when
required by U.S. law. 

As of September 30, 2022, the Company s earliest
open tax year for U.S. federal income tax purposes is its fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. The Company's tax attributes from prior
periods remain subject to adjustment. Open tax years in state and foreign jurisdictions generally range from three to six years. 

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes 

The tax authority within the jurisdiction of each
of the Company s subsidiaries conducts periodic and ad hoc tax filing reviews on business enterprises operating within that jurisdiction
after those enterprises complete their relevant tax filings. Therefore, the Company s subsidiaries tax filings results are
subject to change. It is therefore uncertain as to whether the tax authorities may take different views about the Company s subsidiaries 
tax filings, which may lead to additional tax liabilities. 

ASC 740 requires recognition and measurement of uncertain
income tax positions using a more-likely-than-not approach. The management evaluated the Company s tax positions
and concluded that no provision for uncertainty in income taxes was necessary as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. 

For the purpose of presentation in the consolidated balance sheets, certain
deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been offset. The following is the analysis of the deferred income tax balances for financial
reporting purpose:

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company has adopted and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed
under the Exchange Act, such as this annual report, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules of the SEC. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such
information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required
under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer who also serves as our Chief Financial
Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by
this annual report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer who also serves as our Chief Financial Officer concluded
that the disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective. 

Our Chief Executive Officer, Tomoo Yoshida, has reviewed
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) as of the
end of the period covered by the report for the year ended September 30, 2022 and has concluded that (i) the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that material information relating to the Company is recorded, processed, summarized,
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Commission, and (ii) the Company s controls and procedures
have not been designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under
the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The Company s management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The
Company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management
and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Management conducted
an assessment of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on the
assessment, management concluded that, as of September 30, 2022 the Company s internal control over financial reporting is ineffective
based on those criteria. 

The Company s management, including its Chief
Executive Officer who also serves as our Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
and its internal control processes will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of
a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative
to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of error or fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations
include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that the breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
 Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management
override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error
or fraud may occur and may not be detected. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
 Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 

The matters involving internal controls and procedures
that our Chief Executive Officer considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of Treadway Commission were: domination of management by a single individual without adequate compensating controls, lack of a majority
of outside directors on board of directors, inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives, lack of well-established
procedures to identify, approve and report related party transactions, and lack of an audit committee. 

Management believes that the material weaknesses
did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and inadequate
segregation of duties results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures,
which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods. 

Management recognizes that its controls and procedures
would be substantially improved if we had an audit committee and two individuals serving as officers and as such is actively seeking
to remediate this issue. 

Management s Remediation Initiatives 

In an effort to remediate the identified material
weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated, or plan to initiate, the following series of
measures: 

We have increased our personnel resources and technical
accounting expertise to remediate material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. We plan to appoint one or more outside
directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who
will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving
estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us. 

Management believes that the appointment of one or
more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee
and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board. 

We will work as quickly as possible to implement
these initiatives; however, the lack of adequate working capital and positive cash flow from operations will likely slow this implementation. 

Changes in Internal Control 

There have been no changes in internal controls over
the financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal fourth quarter, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect our internal controls over financial reporting. 

This annual report does not include an attestation
report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s
report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC
that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report.

Biographical information regarding the Officers and
Directors of the Company, who will continue to serve as Officers and Directors of the Company are provided below.

 Yoshida

 Chief
 Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer and Director 

Tomoo Yoshida 

Mr. Yoshida graduated Osaka University of Commerce
in 1986. Immediately after graduation, he joined Toyota Corolla Nankai Co. Ltd. and had been engaged in car sales for eight years. In
1997, Mr. Yoshida incorporated Dipro Data Service Co., Ltd., where he had a managerial role as well as served as an IT support consultant
for five years. In 2002, Mr. Yoshida co-founded e-Learning Laboratory Co., Ltd., e-Learning ), a company that provides
educational services and products. Currently, he is the president of e-Learning. In 2009, e-Communications Co., Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary
of e-Learning and a company offering educational services was incorporated, where Mr. Yoshida has been the president since its incorporation.
In 2011, Mr. Yoshida founded Force Internationale Limited Force Internationale ), a holding company, and appointed as its
director. In 2012, Force International Holdings Limited, a subsidiary of Force Internationale was incorporated, where Mr. Yoshida has
served as a director. 

Corporate Governance 

The Company promotes accountability for adherence
to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents
that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and in other public communications made by the
Company; and strives to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations. The Company has not formally adopted a
written code of business conduct and ethics that governs the Company's employees, officers and directors as the Company is not required
to do so. 

In lieu of an Audit Committee, the Company's board
of director(s) (the Board of Directors or Board ), is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning
the selection of outside auditors, reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Company's financial statements
and other services provided by the Company's independent public accountants. The director(s) of the Company the Director(s) ),
the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company review the Company's internal accounting controls, practices
and policies. We, Exceed World, Inc., only have one Officer and Director, which is Mr. Tomoo Yoshida. 

Committees of the Board 

Our Company currently does not have nominating, compensation,
or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our Company have a written nominating, compensation or audit
committee charter. Our sole Director believes that it is not necessary to have such committees, at this time, because the Director(s)
can adequately perform the functions of such committees. 

Audit Committee Financial Expert 

Our Director has determined that we do not have a
Board member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(D)(5) of Regulation S-K, nor
do we have a Board member that qualifies as independent as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule 14A under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(14) of the FINRA Rules. 

We believe that our Director(s) are capable of analyzing
and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. The Director(s) does
not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because management believes that the Board of Directors can adequately perform
the functions of an audit committee. In addition, we believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an audit
committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the stage
of our development and the fact that we have not generated any positive cash flows from operations to date. 

Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings 

Our sole Officer and Director has not been involved
in or a party in any of the following events or actions during the past ten years: 

1. 
 any bankruptcy
 petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the
 bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; 
 
 2. 
 any conviction in a criminal
 proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); 
 
 3. 
 being subject to any order,
 judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily
 enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities; or 
 
 4. 
 being found by a court
 of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal
 or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated. 
 
 5. 
 Such person was found by
 a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commission to have violated any Federal or State securities law, and
 the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commission has not been subsequently reversed, suspended, or vacated; 
 
 6. 
 Such person was found by
 a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated any Federal commodities
 law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has not been subsequently reversed,
 suspended or vacated; 
 
 7. 
 Such person was the subject
 of, or a party to, any Federal or State judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed,
 suspended or vacated, relating to an alleged violation of:(i) Any Federal or State securities or commodities law or regulation; or(ii)
 Any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent
 injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal
 or prohibition order; or(iii) Any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity;
 or 
 
 8. 
 Such person was the subject
 of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as
 defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of
 the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary
 authority over its members or persons associated with a member. 

Independence of Directors 

We are not required to have independent members of
our Board of Directors, and do not anticipate having independent Directors until such time as we are required to do so. 

Code of Ethics 

We have not adopted a formal Code of Ethics. The
Board of Director(s) evaluated the business of the Company and the number of employees and determined that since the business is operated
by a small number of persons, general rules of fiduciary duty and federal and state criminal, business conduct and securities laws are
adequate ethical guidelines. In the event our operations, employees and/or Directors expand in the future, we may take actions to adopt
a formal Code of Ethics. 

Shareholder Proposals 

Our Company does not have any defined policy or procedural
requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for Directors. The Board of Director(s) believes that, given the
stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our business operations develop
to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to the Board
of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such nominees. The Board of Director(s) will assess
all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations for election or appointment. 

A shareholder who wishes to communicate with our
Board of Director(s) may do so by directing a written request addressed to our sole Officer and Director Tomoo Yoshida, at the address
appearing on the first page of this Information Statement. 

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company s
executive officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of a registered class of the Company s equity
securities, to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of the Company s common stock.
 Such officers, directors and persons are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms
that they file with the SEC. 

Based solely on a review of the copies of such forms
that were received by the Company, or written representations from certain reporting persons that no Form 5s were required for those
persons, the Company is not aware of any failures to file reports or report transactions in a timely manner during the Company s
fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. 

Procedure for Nominating Directors 

During the year ended September 30, 2022, we have
not made any material changes to the procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our Board of Directors. 

Family Relationships 

There are no family relationships among our Directors,
Executive Officers or persons nominated to become executive officers or directors. 

Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings 

During the past ten (10) years, none of our Directors,
persons nominated to become directors, executive officers, promoters or control persons was involved in any of the legal proceedings
listen in Item 401 (f) of Regulation S-K. 

Arrangements 

There are no arrangements or understandings between
an Executive Officer, Director or nominee and any other person pursuant to which he was or is to be selected as an executive officer
or director.

talent necessary to support the Company s long-term business strategy we may award our executive and any future executives with

Beneficial ownership has been determined in accordance
with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. Under this rule, certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person
(if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially
owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire shares (for example, upon exercise of an option or warrant) within 60 days of
the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares is deemed
to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person by reason of such acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of
outstanding shares of any person as shown in the following table does not necessarily reflect the person s actual voting power
at any particular date.
