 ITEM 1. 
BUSINESS 
 The Company. 
 Group, a Bermuda company, 
was established in 
1999 as a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of Holdings. 
On February 24, 
 2000, a corporate restructuring 
was completed and Group 
became the new parent holding company 
of Holdings. 

 Holdings 
continues 
to 
be the 
holding 
company 
for 
the Company s 
U.S. 
based 
operations. 
Holders 
of shares 
of 
 common 
stock 
of 
Holdings 
automatically 
became 
holders 
of 
the 
same 
number 
of 
common 
shares 
of 
Group. 

 Prior to the 
restructuring, Group 
had no significant 
assets or capitalization 
and had 
not engaged 
in any 
business 
 or prior activities other than in connection with the restructuring. 

 In 
connection 
with 
the 
February 
24, 
2000 
restructuring, 
Group 
established 
a 
Bermuda-based 
reinsurance 
 subsidiary, 
Everest 
Reinsurance (Bermuda), 
Ltd. Bermuda 
Re ), which 
commenced business 
in the 
second half 
 of 
2000. 
Group 
also 
formed 
Everest 
Global 
Services, 
Inc., 
a 
Delaware 
subsidiary, 
to 
perform 
administrative 
 functions for Group and its U.S. based 
and non-U.S. based subsidiaries. 

 On 
December 
30, 
2008, 
Group 
contributed 
Holdings 
to 
its 
Irish

company, 
Holdings 
Ireland.

a direct 
subsidiary of 
Group and 
was established

subsidiaries. 
Effective 
July 
1, 
2016, 
the 
Company 
established 
a 
new 
Irish 
holding 
 company, 
Everest

and 
contributed

as the parent holding company 
of Everest Re, 
 a 
Delaware 
property 
and

reinsurer 
formed

 wholly-owned 
subsidiary 
of

On 
October 
6, 
 1995, The Prudential sold its entire interest 
in Holdings in an initial public offering.

principal business, conducted 
through its operating 
segments, is the 
underwriting of reinsurance 
 and 
insurance 
in 
the 
U.S., 
Bermuda 
and

The 
Company 
had 
gross

in 
 2022, 
of 
 14.0

reinsurance 
and

billion. 
The 
Company 
underwrites 
reinsurance 
both 
 through 
brokers 
and 
directly 
with 
ceding 
companies, 
giving

the 
flexibility

business 
based 
on 
the 
 ceding 
company s 
preferred 
reinsurance 
purchasing 
method. 
The 
Company

 Reinsurance Industry Overview. 
 Reinsurance 
is 
an 
arrangement 
in 
which 
an 
insurance 
company, 
the 
reinsurer, 
agrees 
to 
indemnify 
another 
 insurance 
or 
reinsurance 
company, 
the 
ceding 
company, 
against 
all 
or 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
insurance 
risks 
 underwritten by 
the ceding company 
under one or 
more insurance 
contracts. 
Reinsurance can 
provide a 
ceding 
 company 
with 
several 
benefits, 
including 
a 
reduction 
in 
its 
net 
liability 
on 
individual 
risks 
or 
classes 
of 
risks, 
 catastrophe 
protection from 
large and/or 
multiple losses 
and/or a 
reduction in 
operating 
leverage 
as measured 
 by 
the 
ratio 
of 
net 
premiums 
and 
reserves 
to 
capital. 
Reinsurance 
also 
provides 
a 
ceding 
company 
with 
 additional 
underwriting capacity 
by 
permitting 
it to 
accept larger 
risks 
and write 
more business 
than 
would be 
 acceptable 
relative 
to 
the 
ceding 
company s 
financial 
resources. 
Reinsurance 
does 
not 
discharge 
the 
ceding 
 company from its liability to policyholders; 
rather, 
it reimburses the ceding company 
for covered losses. 

 There are two basic 
types of reinsurance 
arrangements: 
treaty and facultative. 
Treaty 
reinsurance obligates 
the 
 ceding company to 
cede and the reinsurer 
to assume a specified 
portion of a type or 
category of risks 
insured by 
 the 
ceding 
company. 
Treaty 
reinsurers 
do 
not separately 
evaluate 
each 
of the 
individual 
risks 
assumed 
under 
 their 
treaties, 
instead, 
the 
reinsurer 
relies 
upon 
the 
pricing 
and 
underwriting 
decisions 
made 
by 
the 
ceding 
 company. 
In facultative 
reinsurance, the 
ceding company 
cedes and the 
reinsurer assumes 
all or part of 
the risk 
 under 
a single 
insurance 
contract. 
Facultative 
reinsurance 
is 
negotiated 
separately 
for 
each insurance 
contract 
 that 
is 
reinsured. 
Facultative 
reinsurance, 
when 
purchased 
by 
ceding 
companies, 
usually 
is 
intended 
to 
cover 
 individual risks not 
covered by their 
reinsurance treaties 
because of the dollar 
limits involved or 
because the risk 
 is unusual. 

 Both treaty and facultative 
reinsurance can be written 
on either a pro rata basis 
or an excess of loss basis. 
Under 
 pro 
rata 
reinsurance, 
the 
ceding 
company 
and 
the 
reinsurer 
share 
the 
premiums 
as 
well 
as 
the 
losses 
and 
 expenses 
in 
an 
agreed 
proportion. 
Under 
excess 
of 
loss 
reinsurance, 
the 
reinsurer 
indemnifies 
the 
ceding 
 company against 
all or 
a specified 
portion of 
losses and 
expenses in 
excess of 
a specified 
dollar amount, 
known 
 as the ceding company's 
retention or reinsurer's 
attachment point, 
generally subject to a 
negotiated reinsurance 
 contract limit. 

 In 
pro 
rata 
reinsurance, 
the 
reinsurer 
generally 
pays 
the 
ceding 
company 
a 
ceding 
commission. 
The 
ceding 
 commission 
generally 
is 
based 
on 
the 
ceding 
company s 
cost 
of 
acquiring 
the 
business 
being 
reinsured 
 (commissions, 
premium 
taxes, 
assessments 
and 
miscellaneous 
administrative 
expense 
and 
may 
contain 
profit 
 sharing provisions, whereby 
the ceding commission is adjusted 
based on loss experience). 
Premiums paid by the 
 ceding company 
to a 
reinsurer for 
excess of 
loss reinsurance 
are not 
directly proportional 
to the 
premiums that 
 the ceding 
company 
receives 
because 
the reinsurer 
does not 
assume a 
proportionate 
risk. 
There is 
usually 
no 
 ceding commission on excess of loss 
reinsurance. 
 Reinsurers 
may purchase 
reinsurance 
to cover 
their own 
risk exposure. 
Reinsurance 
of a 
reinsurer's 
business is 
 called 
a 
retrocession. 
Reinsurance 
companies 
cede risks 
under 
retrocessional 
agreements 
to 
other reinsurers, 
 known as 
retrocessionaires, 
for reasons 
similar to 
those that 
cause insurers 
to purchase 
reinsurance: 
to reduce 

4 
 net 
liability 
on 
individual 
or 
classes 
of 
risks, 
protect 
against 
catastrophic 
losses, 
stabilize 
financial 
ratios 
and 
 obtain additional underwriting capacity. 

 Reinsurance 
can be 
written 
through intermediaries, 
generally 
professional 
reinsurance 
brokers, 
or directly 
with 
 ceding companies. 
From a 
ceding company's 
perspective, 
the broker 
and the 
direct distribution 
channels have 
 advantages 
and disadvantages. 
A ceding 
company's 
decision to 
select one 
distribution 
channel over 
the other 
 will be 
influenced by 
its perception 
of such 
advantages 
and disadvantages 
relative 
to the 
reinsurance 
coverage 
 being placed. 
 Business Strategy. 
 The Company s 
business strategy 
is to 
sustain 
its leadership 
position within 
targeted 
reinsurance 
and insurance 
 markets, 
provide 
effective 
management 
throughout 
the 
property 
and 
casualty 
underwriting 
cycle 
and 
thereby 
 achieve an attractive 
return for 
its shareholders. 
The Company s 
underwriting strategies 
seek to capitalize 
on its 
 i) 
financial 
strength 
and 
capacity, 
ii) 
global 
franchise, 
iii) 
stable 
and 
experienced 
management 
team, 
iv) 
 diversified 
product 
and 
distribution 
offerings, 
v) 
underwriting 
expertise 
and 
disciplined 
approach, 
vi) 
efficient 
 and low-cost operating 
structure and vii) effective 
enterprise risk management practices. 

 The 
Company 
offers 
treaty 
and 
facultative 
reinsurance 
and 
admitted 
and 
non-admitted 
insurance. 
The 
 Company s 
products 
include 
the 
full 
range 
of 
property 
and 
casualty 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
coverages, 
 including marine, aviation, 
surety, 
errors and omissions 
liability E O ), directors 
and officers liability D O ), 
 medical 
malpractice, 
mortgage 
reinsurance, 
other 
specialty 
lines, 
accident 
and 
health A H 
and 
workers 
 compensation. 

 The 
Company s 
underwriting 
strategies 
emphasizes 
underwriting 
profitability 
over 
premium 
volume. 
Key 
 elements of this 
strategy 
include careful 
risk selection, 
appropriate pricing 
through strict 
underwriting discipline 
 and 
adjustment 
of 
the 
Company s 
business 
mix 
in 
response 
to 
changing 
market 
conditions. 
The 
Company 
 focuses 
on 
reinsuring 
companies 
that 
effectively 
manage 
the 
underwriting 
cycle 
through 
proper 
analysis 
and 
 appropriate pricing 
of underlying risks 
and whose underwriting 
guidelines and performance 
are compatible 
with 
 its objectives. 

 The Company s 
underwriting strategies 
emphasize flexibility 
and responsiveness 
to changing 
market conditions. 

 The 
Company 
believes 
that 
its 
existing 
strengths, 
including 
its 
broad 
underwriting 
expertise, 
global 
presence, 
 strong financial ratings and 
substantial capital, facilitate 
adjustments to its mix of business geographically, 
by line 
 of 
business 
and 
by 
type 
of 
coverage, 
allowing 
it 
to 
fully 
participate 
in 
market 
opportunities 
that 
provide 
the 
 greatest 
potential 
for 
underwriting 
profitability. 
The 
Company s 
insurance 
operations 
complement 
these 
 strategies by 
accessing business that 
is not available 
on a reinsurance 
basis. 
The Company carefully 
monitors its 
 mix of business across all operations 
to avoid unacceptable geographic 
or other risk concentrations. 

 Marketing. 
 The Company 
writes business 
on a 
worldwide basis 
for many 
different 
customers 
and lines 
of business, 
thereby 
 obtaining 
a 
broad 
spread 
of 
risk. 
The 
Company 
is 
not 
substantially 
dependent 
on 
any 
single 
customer, 
small 
 group of customers, 
line of business 
or geographic area. 
For the 2022 
calendar year, 
no single customer 
(ceding 
 company 
or 
insured) 
generated 
more 
than 
3.7 
of 
the 
Company s 
gross 
written 
premiums. 
The 
Company 
 believes 
that 
a 
reduction 
of 
business 
from 
any 
one 
customer 
would 
not 
have 
a 
material 
adverse 
effect 
on 
its 
 future financial condition or results of operations. 
 Approximately 
60.2 , 
33.2 
and 
6.6 
of 
the 
Company s 
2022 
gross 
written 
premiums 
were 
written 
in 
the 
 broker reinsurance, 
insurance and direct reinsurance 
markets, respectively. 

 The broker 
reinsurance 
market 
consists 
of several 
substantial 
national 
and international 
brokers 
and a 
number 
 of 
smaller 
specialized 
brokers. 
Brokers 
do 
not 
have 
the 
authority 
to 
bind 
the 
Company 
with 
respect 
to 
 reinsurance 
agreements, 
nor 
does 
the 
Company 
commit 
in 
advance 
to 
accept 
any 
portion 
of 
a 
broker s 
 submitted 
business. 
Reinsurance 
business 
from 
any 
ceding 
company, 
whether 
new 
or 
renewal 
is 
subject 
to 

5 
 acceptance 
by 
the 
Company. 
Brokerage 
fees 
are 
generally 
paid 
by 
reinsurers. 
The 
Company s 
ten 
largest 
 brokers 
accounted 
for 
an 
aggregate 
of 
approximately 
52.7 
of 
gross 
written 
premiums 
in 
2022. 
The 
largest 
 broker, 
Marsh 
and 
McLennan, 
accounted 
for 
approximately 
20.0 
of 
gross 
written 
premiums. 
The 
second 
 largest broker, 
Aon, accounted 
for approximately 
16.6 of gross 
written premiums. 
The Company 
believes that 
 a reduction of business assumed from any one 
broker would not have 
a material adverse effect 
on the Company. 

 The 
direct 
reinsurance 
market 
is 
an 
important 
distribution 
channel 
for 
reinsurance 
business 
written 
by 
the 
 Company. 
Direct 
placement 
of 
reinsurance 
enables 
the 
Company 
to 
access 
clients 
who 
prefer 
to 
place 
their 
 reinsurance directly 
with reinsurers 
based upon the 
reinsurer s in-depth 
understanding of 
the ceding company s 
 needs. 
 The 
Company s 
insurance 
business 
mainly 
writes 
commercial 
property 
and 
casualty 
on 
an 
admitted 
and 
non-
 admitted basis. 
The business 
is written 
through wholesale 
and retail 
brokers, 
surplus lines 
brokers 
and through 
 program 
administrators. 
In 
2022, 
two 
program 
administrators 
accounted 
for 
approximately 
12 
of 
the 
 Company s 
gross 
written 
premium 
in 
total 
and 
included 
multiple 
independent 
programs 
for 
each 
program 
 administrator with the largest 
representing 2 of the overall 
gross written premium. 

 The 
Company 
continually 
evaluates 
each 
business 
relationship, 
including 
the 
underwriting 
expertise 
and 
 experience 
brought 
to 
bear 
through 
the 
involved 
distribution 
channel, 
performs 
analyses 
to 
evaluate 
financial 
 security, monitors 
performance and adjusts underwriting decisions accordingly. 

 Segment Results. 

 The 
Company 
manages 
its 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
operations 
as 
autonomous 
units 
and 
key 
strategic 
 decisions are based on the aggregate operating 
results and projections for 
these segments of business. 

 The Reinsurance 
operation 
writes worldwide 
property 
and casualty 
reinsurance 
and specialty 
lines of 
business, 
 on both 
a treaty 
and facultative 
basis, 
through 
reinsurance 
brokers, 
as well 
as directly 
with ceding 
companies. 

 Business is 
written in 
the U.S., 
Bermuda, and 
Ireland offices, 
as well as, 
through branches 
in Canada, 
Singapore, 
 the United 
Kingdom 
and Switzerland. 
The Insurance 
operation 
writes property 
and casualty

its offices 
in the 
U.S., 
Canada, Chile, 
Singapore, 
United Kingdom, 
Ireland 
 and branches in the Netherlands, 
France, Germany and Spain. 

 These segments are 
managed independently, 
but conform 
with corporate 
guidelines with respect 
to pricing, risk 
 management, 
control 
of 
aggregate 
catastrophe 
exposures, 
capital, 
investments 
and 
support 
operations. 

 Management 
generally 
monitors 
and 
evaluates 
the 
financial 
performance 
of 
these 
operating 
segments 
based 
 upon their underwriting results. 

 Underwriting 
results 
include 
earned 
premium 
less 
losses 
and 
loss 
adjustment 
expenses LAE 
incurred, 
 commission 
and 
brokerage 
expenses 
and 
other 
underwriting 
expenses. 
We 
measure 
our 
underwriting 
results 
 using 
ratios, 
in 
particular 
loss, 
commission 
and 
brokerage 
and 
other 
underwriting 
expense 
ratios, 
which, 
 respectively, 
divide incurred

and brokerage 
and other 
underwriting expenses 
by premiums 
 earned.

 Underwriting. 
 One of the 
Company s strategies 
is to "lead" 
as many 
of the reinsurance 
treaties it 
underwrites as possible. 
The 
 lead 
reinsurer 
on 
a 
treaty 
generally 
accepts 
one 
of 
the 
largest 
percentage 
shares 
of 
the 
treaty 
and 
is 
in 
the 
 strongest 
position to 
negotiate price, 
terms and 
conditions. 
The Company 
leads on approximately 
two-thirds of 
 its 
treaty 
reinsurance 
business 
as 
measured 
by 
premium. 
Management 
believes 
this 
strategy 
enables 
it 
to 
 obtain 
more favorable 
terms and 
conditions on 
the treaties 
on which 
it participates. 
When the 
Company does 
 not 
lead 
the 
treaty, 
it 
may 
still 
suggest 
changes 
to 
any 
aspect 
of 
the 
treaty. 
The 
Company 
may 
decline 
to 
 participate on a treaty based upon 
its assessment of all relevant factors. 
 The 
Company s 
treaty 
underwriting 
process 
involves 
a 
team 
approach 
among 
the 
Company s 
underwriters, 
 actuaries, 
modelling 
and 
claim 
staff. 
Treaties 
are 
reviewed 
for 
compliance 
with 
the 
Company s 
general 
 underwriting 
standards 
and 
most 
larger 
treaties 
are 
subjected 
to 
detailed 
actuarial 
analysis. 
The 
actuarial 

8 
 models 
used 
in 
such 
analyses 
are 
tailored 
in 
each 
case 
to 
the 
subject 
exposures 
and 
loss 
experience. 
The 
 Company 
does 
not 
separately 
evaluate 
each 
of 
the 
individual 
risks 
assumed 
under 
its 
treaties. 
The 
Company 
 does, 
however, 
evaluate 
the 
underwriting 
guidelines, 
data 
and 
other 
information 
of 
its 
ceding 
companies 
to 
 determine 
their 
adequacy 
prior 
to 
entering 
into 
a 
treaty. 
The 
Company 
may 
also 
conduct 
underwriting, 
 operational 
and 
claim 
audits 
at 
the 
offices 
of 
ceding 
companies 
to 
monitor 
adherence 
to 
underwriting 
 guidelines. 
Underwriting audits focus 
on the quality of 
the underwriting staff, 
pricing and risk 
selection and rate 
 monitoring over 
time. 
Claim audits 
may be 
performed in 
order to 
evaluate 
the client s 
claims handling 
abilities 
 and practices. 
 The Company s 
facultative underwriters 
operate within guidelines 
specifying acceptable types 
of risks, limits and 
 maximum 
risk 
exposures. 
Specified 
classes 
of 
large 
premium 
U.S. 
risks 
are 
referred 
to 
Everest 
Re s 
New 
York 
 facultative 
headquarters 
for 
specific 
review 
before 
premium 
quotations 
are 
given 
to 
clients. 
In 
addition, 
the 
 Company s guidelines 
require certain 
types of risks 
to be submitted 
for review 
because of their 
aggregate limits, 
 complexity 
or 
volatility, 
regardless 
of 
premium 
amount 
on 
the 
underlying 
contract. 
Non-U.S. 
risks 
exhibiting 
 similar characteristics are reviewed 
by senior managers within the involved 
operations. 
 In 
addition 
to 
its 
own 
underwriting 
staff, 
the 
Company s 
insurance 
operations 
write 
property 
and 
casualty 
 coverages for 
homogeneous risks 
through select program 
managers. 
These programs 
are evaluated 
based upon 
 actuarial 
analysis 
and 
the 
program 
manager s 
capabilities. 
The 
Company s 
rates, 
forms 
and 
underwriting 
 guidelines 
are 
tailored 
to 
specific 
risk 
types. 
The 
Company s 
underwriting, 
actuarial, 
claim 
and 
financial 
 functions 
work 
closely 
with 
its 
program 
managers 
to 
establish 
appropriate 
underwriting 
and 
processing 
 guidelines as well as appropriate performance 
monitoring mechanisms. 

 Risk Management of Underwriting and Reinsurance 
Arrangements 
 Underwriting Risk 
and Accumulation 
Controls.

Each segment 
and business 
unit manages 
its underwriting 
risk in 
 accordance with 
established guidelines. 
These guidelines 
place dollar 
limits on 
the amount 
of business 
that can 
 be 
written 
based 
on 
a 
variety 
of 
factors, 
including 
(re)insured 
company 
profile, 
line 
of 
business, 
geographic 
 location 
and risk 
hazards. 
In each 
case, 
the guidelines 
permit limited 
exceptions, 
which 
must 
be authorized 
by 
 the Company s 
senior management. 
Management regularly 
reviews and 
revises these 
guidelines in 
response to 
 changes 
in 
business 
unit 
product 
offerings, 
market 
conditions, 
risk 
versus 
reward 
analyses 
and 
the 
Company s 
 enterprise and underwriting risk management processes. 

 The operating results and financial condition 
of the Company can be adversely 
affected by catastrophe 
and other 
 large losses. The Company manages its 
exposure to catastrophes 
and other large losses by: 

selective underwriting practices; 
 
 diversifying its risk portfolio by geographic 
area and by types and classes of business; 
 
 limiting its aggregate catastrophe 
loss exposure in any particular geographic 
zone and contiguous zones; 
 
 purchasing 
reinsurance 
and/or 
retrocessional 
protection 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
such 
coverage 
can 
be 
secured 
 cost-effectively. 
See Reinsurance and Retrocession 
Arrangements . 

 Like other 
insurance 
and reinsurance 
companies, the 
Company is 
exposed to 
multiple insured 
losses arising 
out 
 of a single occurrence, whether a natural 
event, such as a hurricane or an earthquake, 
or other catastrophe, such 
 as 
an 
explosion 
at 
a 
major 
factory. 
A 
large 
catastrophic 
event 
can 
be 
expected 
to 
generate 
insured 
losses 
to 
 multiple 
reinsurance 
treaties, 
facultative 
certificates 
and 
direct 
insurance 
policies 
across 
various 
lines 
of 
 business. 

 The Company focuses 
on potential losses 
that could result 
from any single 
event or series 
of events as 
part of its 
 evaluation and 
monitoring of its aggregate 
exposures to 
catastrophic events. 
Accordingly, 
the Company employs 

9 
 various techniques to 
estimate the amount of 
loss it could sustain 
from any single catastrophic 
event or series of 
 events 
in 
various 
geographic 
areas. 
These 
techniques 
range 
from 
deterministic 
approaches, 
such 
as 
tracking 
 aggregate 
limits 
exposed 
in 
catastrophe-prone 
zones 
and 
applying 
reasonable 
damage 
factors, 
to 
modeled 
 approaches 
that 
attempt 
to 
scientifically 
measure 
catastrophe 
loss 
exposure 
using 
sophisticated 
Monte 
Carlo 
 simulation techniques that forecast 
frequency and severity of potential losses 
on a probabilistic basis. 

 No single computer 
model, or 
group of 
models, is currently 
capable of 
projecting the 
amount and 
probability of 
 loss in 
all global 
geographic regions 
in which 
the Company 
conducts business. 
In addition, 
the form, 
quality and 
 granularity 
of 
underwriting 
exposure 
data 
furnished 
by 
(re)insureds 
is 
not 
uniformly 
compatible 
with 
the 
data 
 requirements 
for 
the 
Company s 
licensed 
models, 
which adds 
to 
the inherent 
imprecision 
in the 
potential 
loss 
 projections. 
Further, 
the 
results 
from 
multiple 
models 
and 
analytical 
methods 
must 
be 
combined 
to 
estimate 
 potential losses 
by and across 
business units. 
Also, while most 
models have been 
updated to incorporate 
claims 
 information 
from 
recent 
catastrophic 
events, 
catastrophe 
model 
projections 
are 
still 
inherently 
imprecise. 
In 
 addition, uncertainties 
with respect 
to future 
climatic patterns 
and cycles 
could add 
further uncertainty 
to loss 
 projections from models based on historical 
data. 

 Nevertheless, 
when combined 
with traditional 
risk management 
techniques 
and sound 
underwriting judgment, 
 catastrophe 
models 
are 
a 
useful 
tool 
for 
underwriters 
to 
price 
catastrophe 
exposed 
risks 
and 
for 
providing 
 management with 
quantitative 
analyses with 
which to monitor 
and manage 
catastrophic 
risk exposures 
by zone 
 and across zones for individual and 
multiple events. 
 Projected 
catastrophe 
losses 
are 
generally 
summarized 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
probable 
maximum 
loss PML ). 
The 
 Company 
defines 
PML 
as its 
anticipated 
loss, 
taking 
into 
account 
contract 
terms 
and limits, 
caused 
by 
a single 
 catastrophe 
affecting 
a 
broad 
contiguous 
geographic 
area, 
such 
as 
that 
caused 
by 
a 
hurricane 
or 
earthquake. 

 The 
PML 
will 
vary 
depending 
upon 
the 
modeled 
simulated 
losses 
and 
the 
make-up 
of 
the 
in 
force 
book 
of 
 business. 
The projected severity levels are 
described in terms of return periods , 
such as 100-year events and 
 250-year 
events . 
For 
example, 
a 100-year 
PML is 
the estimated 
loss 
to 
the current 
in-force 
portfolio 
from 
a 
 single 
event 
which 
has 
a 
1 
probability 
of 
being 
exceeded 
in 
a 
twelve 
month 
period. 
In 
other 
words, 
it 
 corresponds 
to 
a 
99 
probability 
that 
the 
loss 
from 
a 
single 
event 
will 
fall 
below 
the 
indicated 
PML. 
It 
is 
 important 
to note 
that PMLs 
are estimates. 
Modeled events 
are hypothetical 
events 
produced 
by a 
stochastic 
 model. 
As a 
result, 
there 
can 
be no 
assurance 
that 
any 
actual event 
will align 
with the 
modeled event 
or that 
 actual losses from events similar to the 
modeled events will not vary materially 
from the modeled event PML. 
 From 
an 
enterprise 
risk 
management 
perspective, 
management 
sets 
limits 
on 
the 
levels 
of 
catastrophe 
loss 
 exposure 
the 
Company 
may 
underwrite. 
The 
limits 
are 
revised 
periodically 
based 
on 
a 
variety 
of 
factors, 
 including but 
not limited 
to the 
Company s 
financial resources 
and expected 
earnings and 
risk/reward 
analyses 
 of the business being underwritten. 
 The 
Company 
may 
purchase 
reinsurance 
to 
cover 
specific 
business 
written 
or 
the 
potential 
accumulation 
or 
 aggregation 
of exposures 
across some 
or all 
of its 
operations. 
Reinsurance 
purchasing 
decisions consider 
both 
 the 
potential 
coverage 
and 
market 
conditions 
including 
the 
pricing, 
terms, 
conditions, 
availability 
and 
 collectability 
of 
coverage, 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
securing 
cost 
effective 
protection 
from 
financially 
secure 
 counterparties. The 
amount of reinsurance 
purchased has 
varied over 
time, reflecting 
the Company s 
view of its 
 exposures and the cost of reinsurance. 
 Management 
estimates 
that 
the 
projected 
net 
economic 
loss 
from 
its 
largest 
100-year 
event 
in 
a 
given 
zone 
 represents 
approximately 
6.9 
of 
its 
December 
31, 
2022 
shareholders 
equity. 
Economic 
loss 
is 
the 
PML 
 exposure, 
net 
of 
third 
party 
reinsurance 
including 
catastrophe 
industry 
loss 
warranty 
cover, 
reduced 
by 
 estimated reinstatement 
premiums to renew coverage 
and estimated income 
taxes. 
The impact of income taxes 
 on the PML depends 
on the distribution 
of the losses 
by corporate 
entity, 
which is also 
affected by 
inter-affiliate 
 reinsurance. 
Management 
also 
monitors 
and 
controls 
its 
largest 
PMLs 
at 
multiple 
points 
along 
the 
loss 
 distribution 
curve, 
such 
as 
loss 
amounts 
at 
the 
20, 
50, 
100, 
250 
and 
500 
year 
return 
periods. 
This 
process 

10 
 enables 
management 
to 
identify 
and 
control 
exposure 
accumulations 
and 
to 
integrate 
such 
exposures 
into 
 enterprise risk, underwriting and capital management 
decisions. 

 The Company s 
catastrophe 
loss 
projections, 
segmented 
by 
risk 
zones, 
are 
updated 
quarterly 
and 
reviewed 
as 
 part of a formal 
risk management review 
process.

the Company s

 The Company believes 
that its methods 
of monitoring, analyzing 
and managing catastrophe 
exposures provide 
a 
 credible risk management framework, 
which is integrated 
with its enterprise risk management, 
underwriting and 
 capital 
management 
plans. 
However, 
there 
is 
much 
uncertainty 
and 
imprecision 
inherent 
in 
the 
catastrophe 
 models and 
the catastrophe 
loss estimation 
process 
generally. 
As a 
result, 
there can 
be no 
assurance 
that the 
 Company 
will 
not 
experience 
losses 
from 
individual 
events 
that 
exceed 
the 
PML 
or 
other 
return 
period 
 projections, 
perhaps 
by a 
material amount. 
Nor can 
there 
be assurance 
that the 
Company 
will not 
experience 
 events impacting 
multiple zones, 
or multiple 
severe 
events that 
could, in 
the aggregate, 
exceed 
the Company s 
 PML expectations by a significant 
amount. 

 Terrorism 
Risk.
 While 
the 
Company 
writes some 
reinsurance 
contracts 
covering 
terrorism, 
the Company s 
risk 
 management 
philosophy 
is 
to 
limit 
the 
amount 
of 
exposure 
by 
geographic 
region, 
and 
to 
strictly 
manage 
 coverage for 
properties in 
areas that 
may be considered 
a target 
for terrorists. 
Providing terrorism 
coverage on 
 reinsurance 
contracts 
is negotiable, 
and many, 
but not 
all, treaties 
contain 
exclusions 
which limit 
much of 
this 
 risk. 
While many 
property insurance 
policies are required 
to offer 
coverage 
for terrorism, 
this coverage 
is often 
 not 
purchased. 
However, 
terrorism 
is 
typically 
covered 
by 
worker 
compensation 
policies. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
 Company 
is 
exposed 
to 
losses 
from 
terrorism 
on 
both 
its 
reinsurance 
and 
its 
insurance 
book 
of 
business, 
 particularly 
its workers 
compensation 
and property 
policies. 
However, 
the 
insurance 
book 
generally 
does 
not 
 insure large corporations 
or corporate locations that 
represent large concentrations 
of risk. 

 The 
U.S. 
Terrorism 
Risk 
Insurance 
Program 
Reauthorization 
Act 
of 
2019 
provides 
some 
protection 
to 
the 
 insurance 
book of 
business. 
It also 
provides 
indirect protection 
to exposed 
reinsurance 
treaties. 
However, 
the 

11 
 Company 
is 
still 
exposed 
to 
risk 
of 
loss 
from 
terrorism 
due 
to 
deductibles, 
co-pays 
and 
uncovered 
lines 
of 
 business. 

 Reinsurance and Retrocession 
Arrangements.
 
The Company may purchase reinsurance 
to cover specific business 
 written 
or 
the 
potential 
accumulation 
or 
aggregation 
of 
exposures 
across 
some 
or 
all 
of 
its 
operations. 

 Reinsurance 
purchasing 
decisions 
consider 
both 
the 
potential 
coverage 
and 
market 
conditions 
including 
the 
 pricing, 
terms, 
conditions 
and 
availability 
of 
coverage, 
with 
the 
aim 
of securing 
cost 
effective 
protection. 
The 
 amount of 
reinsurance 
purchased 
has varied 
over time, 
reflecting the 
Company s 
view of 
its exposures 
and the 
 cost 
of reinsurance. 
In recent 
years, 
the Company 
has increased 
its use 
of reinsurance 
offered 
through 
capital 
 market facilities. 

 The 
Company 
participates 
in 
 common 
account 
retrocessional 
arrangements 
for 
certain 
reinsurance 
treaties 
 whereby a 
ceding company 
purchases reinsurance 
for the 
benefit of 
itself and 
its reinsurers 
under one 
or more 
 of 
its 
reinsurance 
treaties. 
Common 
account 
retrocessional 
arrangements 
reduce 
the 
effect 
of 
individual 
or 
 aggregate 
losses 
to 
all 
participating 
companies, 
including 
the 
ceding 
company, 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
involved 
 treaties. 
 All 
of 
the 
Company s 
reinsurance 
and 
retrocessional 
agreements 
transfer 
significant 
reinsurance 
risk 
and 
 therefore, 
are 
accounted 
for 
as 
reinsurance 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Financial 
Accounting 
Standards 
Board 
 FASB guidance. 

 At December 
31, 2022, 
the Company 
had 2.2 
billion in 
reinsurance recoverables 
with respect 
to both 
paid and 
 unpaid losses 
ceded. 
Of this 
amount 520 
million, or 
23.2 , was 
recoverable 
from Mt. 
Logan Re 
collateralized 
 segregated 
accounts; 
 283 million, 
or 12.6 , 
was recoverable 
from Munich 
Reinsurance 
America, Inc. Munich 
 Re 
and 
 148 
million, 
or 
6.6 , 
was 
recoverable 
from 
Endurance 
Reinsurance 
Corporation 
of 
America 
 Endurance 
Re ). 
No 
other 
retrocessionaire 
accounted 
for 
more 
than 
5 
of 
our 
recoverables. 
Although 
 management carefully 
selects its 
reinsurers, the 
Company is 
subject to credit 
risk with respect 
to its reinsurance 
 because

 Reserves for Unpaid Property and Casualty Losses and 
LAE. 
 Significant periods of time may elapse 
between the occurrence of an insured 
loss, the reporting of the loss to the 
 insurer and the reinsurer and 
the payment of that loss by the insurer 
and subsequent payments to 
the insurer by 
 the reinsurer. 
To 
recognize liabilities 
for unpaid losses and 
LAE, insurers and 
reinsurers establish 
reserves, which 
 are 
balance sheet 
liabilities representing 
estimates 
of future 
amounts 
needed to 
pay 
reported 
and unreported 
 claims 
and 
related 
expenses 
for 
losses 
that 
have 
already 
occurred. 
Actual 
losses 
and 
LAE 
paid 
may 
deviate, 
 perhaps substantially, 
from such 
reserves. 
To 
the extent 
reserves prove 
to be 
insufficient to 
cover actual 
losses 
 and 
LAE 
after 
taking 
into 
account 
available 
reinsurance 
coverage, 
the 
Company 
would 
have 
to 
recognize 
such 
 reserve 
shortfalls 
and incur 
a charge 
to 
earnings, 
which could 
be material 
in the 
period such 
recognition 
takes 
 place. 
See ITEM 
7, Management s 
Discussion and 
Analysis of 
Financial Condition 
and Results 
of Operations 
 
 Loss and LAE Reserves . 
 As part of the reserving 
process, insurers 
and reinsurers 
evaluate historical 
data and trends 
and make judgments 
 as 
to 
the 
impact 
of 
various 
factors 
such 
as 
legislative 
and 
judicial 
developments 
that 
may 
affect 
future 
claim 
 amounts, changes 
in social 
and political 
attitudes that 
may increase 
loss exposures 
and inflationary 
and general 
 economic 
trends. 
While 
the 
reserving 
process 
is 
difficult 
and 
subjective 
for 
insurance 
companies, 
the 
inherent 
 uncertainties 
of 
estimating 
such 
reserves 
are 
even 
greater 
for 
the 
reinsurer, 
due 
primarily 
to 
the 
longer 
time 
 between the 
date 
of an 
occurrence and 
the reporting 
of any 
attendant 
claims to 
the reinsurer, 
the diversity 
of 
 development 
patterns 
among 
different 
types 
of 
reinsurance 
treaties 
or 
facultative 
contracts, 
the 
necessary 
 reliance 
on 
the 
ceding 
companies 
for 
information 
regarding 
reported 
claims 
and 
differing 
reserving 
practices 
 among ceding 
companies. 
In addition, 
trends 
that have 
affected 
development 
of liabilities 
in the 
past 
may 
not 
 necessarily occur 
or affect 
liability development 
in the 
same manner 
or to 
the same 
degree in 
the future. 
As a 
 result, 
actual 
losses 
and 
LAE 
may 
deviate, 
perhaps 
substantially, 
from 
estimates 
of 
reserves 
reflected 
in 
the 
 Company's consolidated financial statem 
ents. 

 The 
Company s 
loss 
and 
LAE 
reserves 
represent 
management s 
best 
estimate 
of 
the 
ultimate 
liability. 

 Management s 
best estimate 
is developed 
through 
collaboration 
with actuarial, 
underwriting, claims, 
legal 
and 
 finance 
departments 
and 
culminates 
with 
the 
input 
of 
reserve 
committees. 
Each 
segment 
reserve 
committee 
 includes the participation of the relevant parties 
from actuarial, finance, claims and segment senior management 
 and has 
the responsibility 
for recommending 
and approving 
management s 
best estimate. 
Reserves are 
further 
 reviewed 
by 
Everest s 
Chief 
Reserving 
Actuary 
and 
senior 
management. 
The 
objective 
of 
such 
process 
is 
to 
 determine 
a 
single 
best 
estimate 
viewed 
by 
management 
to 
be 
the 
best 
estimate 
of 
its 
ultimate 
loss 
liability. 

 While there 
can 
be no 
assurance 
that 
these reserves 
will not 
need to 
be increased 
in the 
future, 
management 
 believes that 
the Company s 
existing reserves 
and reserving 
methodologies reduce 
the likelihood 
that any 
such 
 increases 
would 
have 
a 
material 
adverse 
effect 
on 
the 
Company s 
financial 
condition, 
results 
of 
operations 
or 
 cash flows. 
These statements 
regarding the 
Company s 
loss reserves 
are forward 
looking statements 
within the 
 meaning 
of 
the 
U.S. 
federal 
securities 
laws 
and 
are 
intended 
to 
be 
covered 
by 
the 
safe 
harbor 
provisions 
 contained 
therein.

 Like many other 
property and casualty 
insurance and reinsurance 
companies, the Company 
has experienced loss 
 development 
for 
prior 
accident 
years, 
which 
has 
impacted 
losses 
and 
LAE 
reserves 
and 
caused 
corresponding 
 effects 
to 
income 
(loss) 
in 
the 
periods 
in 
which 
the 
adjustments 
were 
made. 
There 
can 
be 
no 
assurance 
that 
 adverse 
development 
from 
prior 
years 
will 
not 
occur 
in 
the 
future 
or 
that 
such 
adverse 
development 
will 
not 
 have a material adverse 
effect on net income (loss). 

13 
 Since the Company 
has operations 
in many countries, 
part of the Company s 
loss and LAE reserves 
are in foreign 
 currencies 
and 
translated 
to 
U.S. 
dollars 
for 
each 
reporting 
period. 
Fluctuations 
in 
the 
exchange 
rates 
for 
the 
 currencies, 
period 
over 
period, 
affect 
the 
U.S. 
dollar 
amount 
of 
outstanding 
reserves. 
The 
translation 
 adjustment eliminates 
the impact of the 
exchange fluctuations 
from the reserve 
re-estimates.

 of beginning and ending reserves, see Note 3 of Notes 
to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

 Reserves for Asbestos and Environmental 
Loss and LAE. 
 At December 31, 
2022, the Company s 
gross reserves 
for A E claims 
represented 1.3 
of its total 
reserves. 
The 
 Company s 
A E 
liabilities 
stem 
from 
Mt. 
McKinley 
Insurance 
Company s Mt. 
McKinley 
direct 
insurance 
 business 
and Everest 
Re s 
assumed reinsurance 
business. 
Mt. McKinley 
was a 
former 
wholly-owned subsidiary 
 that was sold in 
2015 to Clearwater Insurance 
Company (Clearwater ), a subsidiary 
of Fairfax Financial. 
Liabilities 
 related to 
Mt. McKinley s 
direct business, 
which had been 
ceded to 
Bermuda Re 
previously, 
were retroceded 
to 
 an affiliate of Clearwater in July 
2015, concurrent with the sale of Mt. McKinley to Clearwater. 

 Concurrently 
with 
the 
closing, 
the 
Company 
entered 
into 
a 
retrocession 
treaty 
with 
an 
affiliate 
of 
Clearwater. 

 Per the retrocession 
treaty, 
the Company retroceded 
100 of the liabilities 
associated with certain 
Mt. McKinley 
 policies, 
which 
had 
been 
reinsured 
by 
Bermuda 
Re. 
As 
consideration 
for 
entering 
into 
the 
retrocession 
treaty, 
 Bermuda Re 
transferred 
cash of 
 140.3 million, 
an amount 
equal to 
the net 
loss reserves 
as of 
the closing 
date. 

 Of 
the 
 140.3 
million 
of 
net 
loss 
reserves 
retroceded, 
 100.5 
million 
were 
related 
to 
A E 
business. 
The 
 maximum 
liability 
retroceded 
under 
the 
retrocession 
treaty 
will 
be 
 440.3 
million, 
equal 
to 
the 
retrocession 
 payment plus 
 300.0 million. 
The Company will 
retain liability 
for any 
amounts exceeding 
the maximum liability 
 retroceded under the retrocession 
treaty. 

 On December 20, 2019, the retrocession 
treaty was amended and 
included a partial commutation. 
As a result of 
 this amendment 
and partial 
commutation, gross 
A E reserves 
and correspondingly 
reinsurance receivable 
were 
 reduced 
by 
 43.4 
million. 
In 
addition, 
the 
maximum 
liability 
permitted 
to 
be 
retroceded 
increased 
to 
 450.3 
 million. 
 Additional losses, 
including those relating 
to latent 
injuries and 
other exposures, 
which are as 
yet unrecognized, 
 the type 
or magnitude 
of which 
cannot be 
foreseen by 
either the 
Company or 
the industry, 
may emerge 
in the 
 future. Such 
future emergence 
could have 
material adverse 
effects on 
the Company s 
future financial condition, 
 results of operations and cash flows. 

 There are 
significant uncertainties 
in estimating 
the amount 
of the 
Company s 
potential losses 
from A E 
claims 
 and 
ultimate 
values 
cannot 
be 
estimated 
using 
traditional 
reserving 
techniques.

 Future Policy Benefit Reserves.
 The Company 
wrote a 
limited amount 
of life 
and annuity 
reinsurance in 
its Reinsurance 
segment. 
Future policy 
 benefit 
liabilities 
for 
annuities 
are 
reported 
at 
the 
accumulated 
fund 
balance 
of these 
contracts. 
Reserves 
for 
 those 
liabilities 
include 
mortality 
provisions 
with 
respect 
to 
life 
and 
annuity 
claims, 
both 
reported 
and 
 unreported. Actual 
experience in a

be worse than

 experience and, consequently, 
 may

 Investments. 
 The board of directors 
of each of the Company s 
operating subsidiaries is 
responsible for establishing 
investment 
 policy and guidelines and, together with senior management, 
for overseeing their execution. 

14 
 The 
Company s 
principal 
investment 
objectives 
are 
to 
ensure 
funds 
are 
available 
to 
meet 
its 
insurance 
and 
 reinsurance obligations 
and to maximize after-tax 
investment income 
while maintaining a high 
quality diversified 
 investment 
portfolio. 
Considering 
these objectives, 
the 
Company 
views 
its investment 
portfolio 
as having 
two 
 components: 1) 
the investments 
needed to 
satisfy outstanding 
liabilities (its 
core fixed 
maturities portfolio) 
and 
 2) investments funded by the Company s 
shareholders equity. 

 For the portion 
needed to satisfy 
global outstanding 
liabilities, the Company 
generally invests 
in fixed maturities 
 with a high level of average 
credit quality. 
This global fixed maturity securities portfolio 
is largely managed on an 
 external 
basis 
by 
independent, 
professional 
investment 
managers 
using 
portfolio 
guidelines 
approved 
by 
the 
 Company. 

 Over 
the 
past 
several 
years, 
the 
Company 
has 
expanded 
the 
allocation 
of 
its 
investments 
funded 
by 
 shareholders equity 
to include: 
1) publicly traded 
equity securities, 2) emerging 
market fixed 
maturities, as well 
 as individual holdings, 
3) high yield 
fixed maturities, 
4) bank and 
private loan 
securities, 5) private 
equity limited 
 partnership 
investments 
and 6) 
Company 
owned life 
insurance. 
The objective 
of this 
portfolio diversification 
is 
 to 
enhance 
the 
risk-adjusted 
total 
return 
of 
the 
investment 
portfolio 
by 
allocating 
a 
prudent 
portion 
of 
the 
 portfolio to higher return asset 
classes. 
The Company limits its allocation to these 
asset classes because of 1) the 
 potential 
for 
volatility 
in 
their 
values 
and 
2) 
the 
impact 
of 
these 
investments 
on 
regulatory 
and 
rating 
agency 
 capital adequacy 
models. 
The Company uses 
investment managers 
experienced in these 
markets and 
adjusts its 
 allocation to these investments 
based upon market conditions. 

 The duration 
of an 
investment 
is based 
on the 
maturity of 
the security 
but also 
reflects the 
payment of 
interest 
 and the 
possibility of 
early prepayments. 
The Company s 
fixed income 
investment 
guidelines include 
a general 
 duration 
guideline. 
This investment 
duration 
guideline is 
established 
and periodically 
revised 
by management, 
 which 
considers 
economic 
and 
business 
factors, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
Company s 
average 
duration 
of 
potential 
 liabilities, which, at December 31, 2022, is estimated 
at approximately 3.8 years, 
based on the estimated payouts 
 of 
underwriting 
liabilities 
using 
standard 
duration 
calculations. 
The 
average 
duration 
of 
the 
fixed 
income 
 portfolio at December 31, 2022 
and 2021 was 3.1 years and 3.2 years, 
respectively. 

 For each 
currency in 
which the 
Company has 
established 
substantial 
loss and 
LAE reserves, 
the Company 
seeks 
 to maintain 
invested 
assets 
denominated in 
such currency 
in an 
amount approximately 
equal to 
the estimated 
 liabilities. 
Approximately 
42.7 
of 
the 
Company s 
consolidated 
reserves 
for 
losses 
and 
LAE 
and 
unearned 
 premiums represent amounts 
payable in foreign currencies. 

 The Company s 
cash and 
invested 
assets 
totaled 
 29.9 billion 
at December 
31, 2022, 
which consisted 
of 85.4 
 fixed maturities, 
short term investments 
and cash, of which 
93.2 were investment 
grade; 13.7 other 
invested 
 assets and 
0.9 equity 
securities. 
The average 
maturity of 
fixed maturity 
securities was 
4.6 years 
at December 
 31, 2022, and their overall average 
duration was 3.1 years. 

 As of 
December 31, 
2022, the 
Company did 
not have 
any direct 
investments 
in commercial 
real estate 
or direct 
 commercial 
mortgages 
or 
securities 
of 
issuers 
that 
are 
experiencing 
cash 
flow 
difficulty 
to 
an 
extent 
that 
the 
 Company s 
management 
believes 
could 
threaten 
the 
issuer s 
ability 
to 
meet 
debt 
service 
payments, 
except 
 where an allowance for credit 
losses has been recognized. 

 The Company s 
investment 
portfolio includes 
structured commercial 
mortgage-backed 
securities CMBS 
with 
 a book 
value of 
 1.0 billion 
and a 
fair val 
ue of 
 925.8 million. 
CMBS securities 
comprising more

 Financial Strength Ratings. 
 The 
following 
table 
shows 
the 
current 
financial 
strength 
ratings 
of 
the 
Company s 
operating 
subsidiaries 
as 
 reported 
by 
A.M. 
Best, 
S P 
Global 
Ratings S P 
and 
Moody s. 
These 
ratings 
represent 
an 
independent 
 opinion 
of 
the 
financial 
strength, 
operating 
performance, 
business 
profile 
and 
ability 
to 
meet 
policyholder 
 obligations. 
The ratings 
are not 
intended to 
be an 
indication of 
the degree 
or lack 
of risk 
involved 
in a 
direct or 
 indirect 
equity 
investment 
or 
a 
recommendation 
to 
buy, 
sell 
or 
hold 
our 
securities. 
Additionally, 
rating 
 organizations 
may 
change 
their 
rating 
methodology, 
which 
could 
have 
a 
material 
impact 
on 
our 
financial 
 strength ratings. 
 All 
of 
the 
below-mentioned 
ratings 
are 
continually 
monitored 
and 
revised, 
if 
necessary, 
by 
each 
of 
the 
rating 
 agencies. 
The ratings presented in 
the following table were in 
effect as of January 31, 2023. 

17 
 The Company 
believes that 
its ratings 
are important 
as they 
provide the 
Company s 
customers 
and others 
with 
 an 
independent 
assessment 
of 
the 
Company s 
financial 
strength 
using 
a 
rating 
scale 
that 
provides 
for 
relative 
 comparisons. 
Strong financial 
ratings are 
particularly important 
for reinsurance 
and insurance 
companies given 
 that customers 
rely on a company 
to pay covered 
losses well into the future. 
As a result, a highly rated 
company 
 is generally preferred.

 Competition. 
 The worldwide 
reinsurance 
and insurance 
businesses 
are highly 
competitive, 
as well 
as cyclical 
by 
product 
and 
 market. 
As 
such, 
financial 
results 
tend 
to 
fluctuate 
with 
periods 
of 
constrained 
availability, 
higher 
rates 
and 
 stronger 
profits 
followed 
by 
periods 
of 
abundant 
capacity, 
lower 
rates 
and 
constrained 
profitability. 

 Competition 
in 
the 
types 
of reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
business 
that 
we 
underwrite 
is 
based 
on 
many 
factors, 
 including the perceived overall 
financial strength of 
the reinsurer or insurer, 
ratings of the reinsurer 
or insurer by 
 A.M. Best 
and/or 
Standard 
 Poor s, 
underwriting expertise, 
the jurisdictions 
where the 
reinsurer 
or insurer 
is 
 licensed 
or 
otherwise 
authorized, 
capacity 
and 
coverages 
offered, 
premiums 
charged, 
other 
terms 
and 
 conditions 
of 
the 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
business 
offered, 
services 
offered, 
speed 
of 
claims 
payment 
and 
 reputation 
and 
experience 
in 
lines 
written. 
Furthermore, 
the 
market 
impact 
from 
these 
competitive 
factors 
 related 
to 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
is 
generally 
not 
consistent 
across 
lines 
of 
business, 
domestic 
and 
 international geographical 
areas and distribution channels. 

 We 
compete 
in 
the 
U.S., 
Bermuda 
and 
international 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
markets 
with 
numerous 
global 
 competitors. 
Our 
competitors 
include 
independent 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
companies, 
subsidiaries 
or 
 affiliates 
of 
established 
worldwide 
insurance 
companies, 
reinsurance 
departments 
of 
certain 
insurance 
 companies, domestic 
and international 
underwriting operations, 
including underwriting 
syndicates 
at Lloyd s 
of 
 London 
and 
certain 
government 
sponsored 
risk 
transfer 
vehicles. 
Some 
of 
these 
competitors 
have 
greater 
 financial resources 
than we do 
and have 
established long 
term and continuing 
business relationships, 
which can 
 be 
a 
significant 
competitive 
advantage. 
In 
addition, 
the 
lack 
of 
strong 
barriers 
to 
entry 
into 
the 
reinsurance 
 business 
and 
the 
securitization 
of 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
risks 
through 
capital 
markets 
provide 
additional 
 sources of potential reinsurance 
and insurance capacity and competition. 

 Worldwide insurance 
and reinsurance 
market conditions 
historically have 
been competitive. 
Generally, 
there is 
 ample 
insurance 
and 
reinsurance 
capacity 
relative 
to 
demand, 
as 
well 
as 
additional 
capital 
from 
the 
capital 
 markets 
through 
insurance 
linked 
financial 
instruments. 
These 
financial 
instruments 
such 
as 
side 
cars, 
 catastrophe 
bonds and 
collateralized 
reinsurance 
funds, provided 
capital 
markets 
with access 
to insurance 
and 
 reinsurance 
risk exposure. 
The capital 
markets 
demand 
for 
these products 
is primarily 
driven 
by 
the desire 
to 
 achieve 
greater 
risk 
diversification 
and 
potentially 
higher 
returns 
on 
their 
investments. 
This 
competition 
 generally has a negative impact 
on rates, terms and conditions; 
however, 
the impact varies widely by market 
and 
 coverage. 
Based on recent competitive 
behaviors in the 
insurance and reinsurance 
industry, natural 
catastrophe 
 events 
and 
the 
macroeconomic 
backdrop, 
there 
has 
been 
some 
dislocation 
in 
the 
market 
which 
we 
expect 
to 
 have a positive impact on rates 
and terms and conditions, generally, 
though local market specificities can 
vary. 

 The 
increased 
frequency 
of 
catastrophe 
losses 
experienced 
throughout 
2022 
appears 
to 
be 
pressuring 
the 
 increase 
of 
rates. 
As 
business 
activity 
continues 
to 
regain 
strength 
after 
the 
pandemic 
and 
current 
 macroeconomic uncertainty, 
rates appear to be firming in 
most lines of business, particularly in the casualty 
lines 
 that had 
seen significant 
losses such 
as excess 
casualty and 
directors 
and officers 
liability. 
Other casualty 
lines 
 are 
experiencing 
modest 
rate 
increase, 
while 
some 
lines 
such 
as 
workers 
compensation 
were 
experiencing 
 softer 
market 
conditions. 
It 
is 
too 
early 
to 
tell 
what 
the 
impact 
on 
pricing 
conditions 
will 
be, 
but 
it 
is 
likely 
to 
 change depending on the line of business and geography. 
 Our capital position remains 
a source of strength, 
with high quality invested 
assets, significant liquidity 
and a low 
 operating 
expense 
ratio. 
Our 
diversified 
global 
platform 
with 
its 
broad 
mix 
of 
products, 
distribution 
and 
 geography is resilient. 
 The war in the 
Ukraine is ongoing 
and an evolving 
event. 
Economic and legal 
sanctions have been 
levied against 
 Russia, 
specific 
named 
individuals 
and 
entities 
connected 
to 
the 
Russian 
government, 
as 
well 
as 
businesses 
 located 
in 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
and/or 
owned 
by 
Russian 
nationals 
by 
numerous 
countries, 
including 
the 
 United States. 
The significant 
political and 
economic uncertainty 
surrounding the 
war and 
associated sanctions 
 have 
impacted 
economic and 
investment 
markets 
both within 
Russia and 
around 
the world. 
The Company 
has 
 recorded 45 million of losses related 
to the Ukraine/Russia war during 2022.

the success of our business, and so we strive 
to attract and retain 
a high standard

subject 
to

bargaining 
agreements, 
and the 
Company 
is 
 not aware of any current 
efforts to implement such agreements.

committed 
to

with 
an

has 
made 
available 
to

Everest 
actively 
manages 
its 
 succession

throughout 
our

 Diversity and Inclusion. 
 Our strength 
and success derive 
from our diversity, 
and we are 
at our best 
when we embrace 
diverse views 
and 
 perspectives. 
Equality 
in 
opportunity, 
career 
development, 
compensation 
and 
respect 
for 
all 
individuals 
are 
 fundamental human 
rights that 
are at 
the forefront 
of our 
culture and 
promoted not 
only within 
our workplace 
 but also the global 
communities in which 
we operate. 
Our Board is 
committed to 
diversity within 
its structure as 
 well as 
emphasizing its 
importance in 
our senior 
executive 
leadership. We 
believe that 
diversity 
in gender, 
age, 
 ethnicity 
and 
skill 
set 
allows 
for 
dynamic 
and 
evolving 
perspectives 
in 
governance, 
strategy, 
corporate 
 responsibility, 
human rights and risk management. 

Proactive 
diversity 
recruitment 
is 
an 
integral 
aspect 
of 
succession 
planning 
at 
both 
the 
board 
level 
and 
 throughout 
all 
levels 
in 
the 
organization. 
Our 
Talent 
Development 
team 
works 
with 
senior 
management 
to 
 identify 
women 
and 
persons 
of color 
across 
the 
Company 
as 
potential 
leaders. 
These 
individuals 
are 
provided 
 management 
and 
executive 
leadership 
training 
and 
education 
to 
enhance 
their 
skillsets 
and 
provide 
 opportunities for 
advancement. 
Indeed, our 
executive 
officers are 
measured on 
their forward-thinking 
diversity 
 initiatives 
as 
part 
of 
their 
annual 
performance 
evaluations. 
Such 
diversity 
at 
the 
most 
senior 
levels 
of 
our 
 organization 
reflects our commitment 
to identify and 
develop highly qualified 
women and individuals 
of color to 
 help lead our Company into the future. 

 The 
work 
of 
the 
DEI 
Council 
has 
helped 
enhance 
the 
employee 
experience 
for 
all 
our 
colleagues 
across 
the 
 organization 
worldwide. 
The 
council 
encourages 
continuous 
and 
open 
dialogue 
between 
executive 
and 
senior 
 management 
and 
traditionally 
underrepresented 
groups 
at 
all 
levels, 
without 
fear 
of 
reprisal 
or 
retaliation, 
to 
 identify areas 
of improvement 
and carry 
out the 
message of 
inclusion both 
inside and 
outside our 
organization. 
 The 
DEI 
council 
was 
instrumental 
in 
forming 
and 
supporting 
additional 
Employee 
Resource 
Groups ERGs ), 
 developing 
a 
Regional 
Representation 
network 
and 
leveraging 
specific 
Talent

 Regulatory Matters. 
 The Company and 
its insurance subsidiaries 
are subject to 
regulation under the 
insurance statutes 
of the various 
 jurisdictions in which they 
conduct business, including 
essentially all states 
of the U.S., Canada, 
Singapore, Brazil, 
 the United Kingdom, 
Ireland, Chile and 
Bermuda. 
These regulations vary 
from jurisdiction to 
jurisdiction and are 
 generally 
designed 
to 
protect 
ceding 
insurance 
companies 
and 
policyholders 
by 
regulating 
the 
Company s 
 conduct 
of 
business, 
financial 
integrity 
and 
ability 
to 
meet 
its 
obligations. 
Many 
of 
these 
regulations 
require 
 reporting of information designed to 
allow insurance regulators 
to closely monitor the Company s 
performance. 

 Insurance 
Holding Company 
Regulation. 
Under applicable 
U.S. laws 
and regulations, 
no person, 
corporation 
or 
 other 
entity 
may 
acquire 
a 
controlling 
interest 
in 
the 
Company, 
unless 
such 
person, 
corporation 
or 
entity 
has 
 obtained 
the prior 
approval 
for 
such 
acquisition 
from 
the insurance 
commissioners 
of Delaware 
and 
the 
other 

20 
 states 
in 
which 
the 
Company s 
insurance 
subsidiaries 
are 
domiciled 
or 
deemed 
domiciled, 
currently 
California 
 and Georgia. 
Under these 
laws, control 
is presumed 
when any 
person acquires, 
directly or 
indirectly, 
10 or 
 more 
of 
the 
voting 
securities 
of 
an 
insurance 
company. 
To 
obtain 
the 
approval 
of 
any 
change 
in 
control, 
the 
 proposed 
acquirer 
must 
file 
an 
application 
with 
the 
relevant 
insurance 
commissioner 
disclosing, 
among 
other 
 things, the background of the acquirer and that 
of its directors and officers, the 
acquirer s financial condition 
and 
 its proposed 
changes in 
the management 
and operations 
of the 
insurance 
company. 
U.S. 
state 
regulators 
also 
 require 
prior 
notice 
or 
regulatory 
approval 
of 
material 
inter-affiliate 
transactions 
within 
the 
holding 
company 
 structure. 

 The Insurance Companies Act 
of Canada requires prior 
approval by 
the Minister of Finance of 
anyone acquiring a 
 significant 
interest 
in an 
insurance 
company 
authorized 
to do 
business 
in Canada. 
In addition, 
the Company 
is 
 subject to regulation by the insurance 
regulators of other states 
and foreign jurisdictions in which it is 
authorized 
 to do 
business. 
Certain of 
these states 
and foreign 
jurisdictions impose 
regulations regulating 
the ability 
of any 
 person 
to 
acquire 
control 
of 
an 
insurance 
company 
authorized 
to 
do 
business 
in 
that 
jurisdiction 
without 
 appropriate regulatory 
approval similar to those described above. 

 Dividends. 
 Under Bermuda law, 
Group is 
prohibited from 
declaring or paying 
a dividend 
if such payment 
would 
 reduce the realizable 
value of its 
assets to an amount 
less than the aggregate 
value of its liabilities 
and its issued 
 share 
capital 
and share 
premium 
(additional 
paid-in 
capital) 
accounts. 
Group s 
ability 
to 
pay 
dividends 
and its 
 operating 
expenses 
is 
partially 
dependent 
upon 
dividends 
from 
its 
subsidiaries. 
The 
payment 
of 
dividends 
by 
 insurance 
subsidiaries 
is 
limited 
under 
Bermuda 
law 
as 
well 
as 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
various 
U.S. 
states 
in 
which 
 Group s 
insurance 
and 
reinsurance 
subsidiaries 
are 
domiciled 
or 
deemed 
domiciled. 
The 
limitations 
are 
 generally 
based 
upon 
net 
income 
(loss) 
and 
compliance 
with 
applicable 
policyholders 
surplus 
or 
minimum 
 solvency 
and 
liquidity 
requirements 
as 
determined 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
relevant 
statutory 
accounting 
 practices. 
Under 
Irish 
corporate 
and 
regulatory 
law, 
Holdings 
Ireland, 
Everest 
Dublin 
Holdings 
and 
their 
 subsidiaries are limited as to the dividends 
they can pay based on retained earnings 
and net income (loss) and/or 
 capital and minimum solvency requirements. 
As Holdings has outstanding debt obligations, 
it is dependent upon 
 dividends 
and 
other 
permissible 
payments 
from 
its 
operating 
subsidiaries 
to 
enable 
it 
to 
meet 
its 
debt 
and 
 operating expense obligations 
and to pay dividends. 

 Under 
Bermuda 
law, 
Bermuda 
Re, 
Everest 
International 
and 
Everest 
Assurance 
are 
unable 
to 
declare 
or 
make 
 payment 
of a 
dividend if 
they 
fail to 
meet their 
minimum solvency 
margin or 
minimum liquidity 
ratio. 
As long 
 term insurers, 
Bermuda Re and 
Everest Assurance 
are also unable 
to declare or 
pay a dividend 
to anyone 
who is 
 not a policyholder unless, after 
payment of the dividend, 
the value of the assets in 
their long term business fund, 
 as 
certified by 
their 
approved 
actuary, 
exceeds 
their 
liabilities 
for 
long 
term 
business 
by 
at 
least 
the 
 250,000 
 minimum 
solvency 
margin. 
Prior 
approval 
of 
the 
Bermuda 
Monetary 
Authority 
is 
required 
if 
Bermuda 
Re s, 
 Everest 
International s 
or 
Everest 
Assurance s 
dividend 
payments 
would 
exceed 
25 
of 
their 
prior 
year 
end 
 statutory 
capital and 
surplus. 
At December 
31, 2022, 
Bermuda Re, 
Everest 
International and 
Everest 
Assurance 
 exceeded their solvency and liquidity 
requirements. 

 The 
payment 
of 
dividends 
to 
Holdings 
by 
Everest 
Re 
is 
subject 
to 
limitations 
imposed 
by 
Delaware 
law. 

 Generally, 
Everest 
Re 
may 
only 
pay 
dividends 
out 
of 
its 
statutory 
earned 
surplus, 
which 
was 
 5.6 
billion 
at 
 December 
31, 2022, 
and only 
after 
it 
has 
given 
10 days 
prior 
notice to 
the 
Delaware 
Insurance 
Commissioner. 

 During this 10-day 
period, the 
Commissioner may, 
by order, 
limit or disallow 
the payment 
of ordinary 
dividends 
 if the 
Commissioner finds 
the insurer 
to be 
presently 
or potentially 
in financial 
distress. 
Further, 
the maximum 
 amount 
of dividends 
that 
may 
be paid 
without 
the 
prior 
approval 
of the 
Delaware 
Insurance 
Commissioner 
in 
 any 
twelve 
month 
period is 
the 
greater 
of (1) 
10 of 
the 
insurer s 
statutory 
surplus 
as of 
the 
end of 
the 
prior 
 calendar year 
or (2) the 
insurer s statutory 
net income (loss), 
not including realized 
capital gains 
(losses), for 
the 
 prior calendar 
year. 
Accordingly, 
the maximum 
amount 
that 
will be 
available 
for 
the payment 
of dividends 
by 
 Everest 
Re in 
2023 without triggering 
the requirement 
for prior 
approval of 
regulatory authorities 
in connection 
 with a dividend is 555 million.

Bermuda 
Re s 
operations 
in 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
and 
 worldwide 
are 
subject 
to 
regulation 
by 
the 
Prudential 
Regulation 
Authority 
(the 
 PRA ). 
The 
PRA 
imposes 
 solvency, 
capital adequacy, 
audit, financial 
reporting and 
other regulatory 
requirements 
on insurers 
transacting 
 business 
in the 
United Kingdom. 
Bermuda Re 
presently 
meets or 
exceeds 
all of 
the PRA s 
solvency 
and capital 
 requirements. 

 U.S. 
domestic 
property 
and 
casualty 
insurers, 
including 
reinsurers, 
are 
subject 
to 
regulation 
by 
their 
state 
of 
 domicile 
and 
by 
those 
states 
in 
which 
they 
are 
licensed. 
The 
regulation 
of 
reinsurers 
is 
typically 
focused 
on 
 financial 
condition, 
investments, 
management 
and 
operation. 
The 
rates 
and 
policy 
terms 
of 
reinsurance 
 agreements are generally not 
subject to direct regulation by any 
governmental authority. 

 The operations 
of Everest 
Re s 
foreign 
branch 
offices in 
Canada 
and Singapore 
are subject 
to regulation 
by the 
 insurance 
regulatory 
officials 
of 
those 
jurisdictions. 
Management 
believes 
that 
the 
Company 
is 
in 
compliance 
 with applicable laws and regulations 
pertaining to its business and operations. 

 Everest 
Indemnity, 
Everest 
National, 
Everest 
Security, 
Everest 
Denali 
and 
Everest 
Premier 
are 
subject 
to 
 regulations 
similar to 
the U.S. 
regulations 
applicable 
to 
Everest 
Re. 
In addition, 
these companies 
must 
comply 
 with 
substantial 
regulatory 
requirements 
in 
each 
state 
where 
they 
conduct 
business. 
These 
additional 
 requirements 
include, 
but 
are 
not 
limited 
to, 
rate 
and 
policy 
form 
requirements, 
requirements 
with 
regard 
to 
 licensing, 
agent 
appointments, 
participation 
in 
residual 
markets 
and 
claim 
handling 
procedures. 
These 
 regulations are primarily designed for the protection 
of policyholders. 

 The operations of Ireland Insurance 
and its branch offices in Netherlands, 
Germany, France 
and Spain are subject 
 to 
regulation 
by 
the 
insurance

 Periodic Examinations. 
 Led by their 
state of 
domicile, U.S. 
insurance companies 
are subject 
to periodic financial 
 examination 
of 
their 
affairs, 
usually 
every 
three 
to 
five 
years. 
U.S. 
insurance 
companies 
are 
also 
subject 
to 
 examinations 
by the 
various 
state 
insurance 
departments 
where they 
are 
licensed concerning 
compliance with 
 applicable conduct 
of business 
regulations. 
In addition, 
foreign insurance 
companies and 
foreign branch 
offices 
 are subject 
to examination 
and review 
by regulators 
in their 
various 
jurisdictions. 
None of 
the reports 
of these 
 examinations or reviews contained 
any material findings or recommendations. 

 NAIC Risk-Based 
Capital Requirements. 
The U.S. 
National 
Association of 
Insurance 
Commissioners NAIC has 
 developed a 
formula to 
measure the 
statutory minimum 
amount of 
capital required 
for a 
property and 
casualty 
 insurance 
company 
to 
support 
its 
overall 
business 
operations 
in 
light 
of 
its 
size 
and 
risk 
profile. 
The 
major 
 categories 
of 
a 
company s 
risk 
profile 
are 
its 
asset 
risk, 
credit 
risk, 
and 
underwriting 
risk. 
The 
standard 
is 
an 
 effort 
to 
anticipate 
insolvencies. 
This 
allows 
regulators 
to 
take 
actions 
that 
could 
limit 
the 
impact 
of 
these 
 insolvencies on policyholders. 

23 
 Under the 
approved 
formula, 
a company s 
adjusted 
statutory 
surplus (end 
of period 
surplus adjusted 
for items 
 not currently 
applicable 
to 
the Everest 
companies) 
is compared 
to 
its risk 
based 
capital RBC ). 
If this 
ratio 
is 
 above a minimum 
threshold, no 
action is necessary. 
Below this threshold 
are four distinct 
action levels at 
which 
 an insurer s 
domiciliary state 
regulator can 
intervene with 
increasing degrees 
of authority 
over an insurer 
as the 
 ratio 
of 
adjusted 
surplus 
to 
RBC 
decreases. 
The 
mildest 
intervention 
requires 
an 
insurer 
to 
submit 
a 
plan 
of 
 appropriate corrective actions. 
The most severe action requires 
an insurer to be rehabilitated or 
liquidated. 

 Based on their financial positions at December 31, 2022, Everest 
Re, Everest National, 
Everest Indemnity, 
Everest 
 Security, Everest 
Denali and Everest Premier exceed 
the minimum thresholds. 

 Tax Matters.
 The following summary 
of the taxation 
of the Company 
is based on current 
law. 
There can be 
no assurance that 
 legislative, judicial, or administrative 
changes will not be enacted that might materially 
affect this summary. 
 Bermuda.
 
Under Bermuda 
law, 
no income, 
withholding or 
capital 
gains 
taxes 
are imposed 
upon Group 
and its 
 Bermuda 
subsidiaries. 
Group 
and its 
Bermuda 
subsidiaries 
have 
received 
an undertaking 
from 
the 
Minister 
of 
 Finance in 
Bermuda 
that, 
in the 
event 
of any 
taxes 
being imposed, 
Group 
and its 
Bermuda 
subsidiaries 
will be 
 exempt 
from 
taxation 
in 
Bermuda 
until 
March 
2035. 
Non-Bermuda 
branches 
of 
Bermuda 
subsidiaries 
are 
 subject to local taxes in 
the jurisdictions in which they operate. 

 United 
States. 
On 
December 
22, 
2017, 
the 
Tax 
Cuts 
and 
Jobs 
Act TCJA 
was 
signed 
into 
law. 
The 
Internal 
 Revenue Service IRS and 
the United 
States 
Treasury 
Department U.S. 
Treasury 
have subsequently 
issued 
 both proposed and 
final regulations related 
to the new law. 
Management continues 
to monitor this 
guidance as 
 it 
is 
issued 
to 
determine 
the 
impact 
on 
the 
Company 
and 
acts 
if necessary. 
Group s 
U.S. 
subsidiaries 
conduct 
 business in and are 
subject to taxation 
in the U.S. Non-U.S. 
branches of U.S. subsidiaries 
are subject to both 
local 
 taxation in 
the jurisdictions in which 
they operate 
and U.S. corporate 
income tax but 
are generally 
relieved from 
 double 
taxation 
through 
the 
use 
of 
foreign 
tax 
credits 
against 
their 
U.S. 
income 
tax 
liability. 
Should 
the 
U.S. 
 subsidiaries 
distribute 
current 
or 
accumulated 
earnings 
and 
profits 
in 
the 
form 
of 
dividends 
or 
otherwise, 
the 
 Company 
would 
be 
subject 
to 
withholding 
taxes. 
The 
cumulative 
amount 
that 
would 
be 
subject 
to 
U.S. 
 withholding 
tax, 
if distributed, 
is not 
practicable 
to 
compute. 
Group 
and its 
Bermuda subsidiaries 
believe 
that 
 they 
have 
operated 
and 
will 
continue 
to 
operate 
their 
businesses 
in 
a 
manner 
that 
will 
not 
cause 
them 
to 
 generate income treated 
as effectively connected 
with the conduct of a trade or 
business within the U.S. 
On this 
 basis, Group 
does not 
expect that 
it and 
its Bermuda 
subsidiaries will 
be required 
to pay 
U.S. corporate 
income 
 taxes 
other 
than 
withholding 
taxes 
on 
certain 
investment 
income 
and 
premium 
excise 
taxes. 
If 
Group 
or 
its 
 Bermuda 
subsidiaries 
were 
to 
become 
subject 
to 
U.S. 
income 
tax, 
there 
could 
be a 
material 
adverse 
effect 
on 
 the Company s financial condition, 
results of operations and cash flows. 

 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA 
was enacted. We have 
evaluated the tax 
 provisions of the IRA, the most significant of which are 
the corporate alternative 
minimum tax and the share 
 repurchase excise tax 
and do not expect the legislation to have 
a material impact on our results of operations. 
As 
 the IRS issues additional guidance, we will evaluate 
any impact to our consolidated 
financial statements.

the Company s 
Lloyd s

Bermuda Re believes 
that it has

a

 ITEM 1A. 
RISK FACTORS 
 In addition to the other information 
provided in this report, 
the following risk factors 
should be considered when 
 evaluating 
an 
investment 
in 
our 
securities. 
If 
the 
circumstances 
contemplated 
by 
the 
individual 
risk 
factors 
 materialize, our business, financial condition 
and results of operations could 
be materially and adversely affected 
 and the trading price of our common shares could 
decline significantly. 

25 
 RISKS RELATING TO 
OUR BUSINESS 
 Our results could be adversely affected by catastrophic 
events. 

 We are exposed 
to unpredictable catastrophic 
events, including weather-related 
and other natural 
catastrophes, 
 as well as acts of 
terrorism. 
The frequency and/or 
severity of catastrophic 
events may be 
impacted in the future 
 by 
the 
continued 
effects 
of 
climate 
change. 
Climate 
change 
and 
resulting 
changes 
in 
global 
temperatures, 
 weather patterns, 
and sea 
levels may 
both increase 
the frequency 
and severity 
of natural 
catastrophes 
and the 
 resulting 
losses 
in 
the 
future 
and 
impact 
our 
risk 
modeling 
assumptions. 
We 
cannot 
predict 
the 
impact 
that 
 changing 
climate 
conditions, 
if 
any, 
may 
have 
on 
our 
results 
of 
operations 
or 
our 
financial 
condition. 
 Additionally, 
we cannot 
predict how 
legal, regulatory 
and/or social 
responses to 
concerns around 
global climate 
 change 
and 
the 
resulting 
impact 
on 
various 
sectors 
of 
the 
economy 
may 
impact 
our 
business. 
Any 
material 
 reduction in our operating 
results caused by 
the occurrence of one or 
more catastrophes 
could inhibit our ability 
 to 
pay 
dividends 
or 
to 
meet our 
interest 
and 
principal 
payment 
obligations. 
By 
way 
of illustration, 
during 
the 
 past five calendar years, pre 
-tax catastrophe 
losses, net of reinsurance, were as follows: 

 Calendar year: 
 Pre-tax net catastrophe losses 
 (Dollars in millions) 
 2022 
 
 1,055 
 2021 
 1,135 
 2020 
 425 
 2019 
 576 
 2018 
 1,800 
 Our losses from future catastrophic events 
could exceed our projections. 

 We 
use 
projections 
of 
possible 
losses 
from 
future 
catastrophic 
events 
of 
varying 
types 
and 
magnitudes 
as 
a 
 strategic underwriting tool. 
We use these loss projections 
to estimate our potential 
catastrophe losses 
in certain 
 geographic areas 
and decide 
on the placement 
of retrocessional 
coverage or 
other actions 
to limit the 
extent of 
 potential 
losses 
in 
a 
given 
geographic 
area. 
These 
loss 
projections 
are 
approximations, 
reliant 
on 
a 
mix 
of 
 quantitative 
and 
qualitative 
processes, 
and 
actual 
losses 
may 
exceed 
the 
projections 
by 
a 
material 
amount, 
 resulting in a material adverse effect 
on our financial condition and results of operations. 

26 
 If our loss 
reserves are inadequate 
to meet our 
actual losses, our 
net income 
would be reduced 
or we could 
incur 
 a loss. 

 We 
are 
required 
to 
maintain 
reserves 
to 
cover 
our 
estimated 
ultimate 
liability 
of 
losses 
and 
LAE 
for 
both 
 reported and 
unreported claims 
incurred. 
These reserves 
are only 
estimates of 
what we 
believe the 
settlement 
 and administration 
of claims will 
cost based 
on facts and 
circumstances known 
to us. 
In setting 
reserves for 
our 
 reinsurance 
liabilities, 
we 
rely 
on 
claim 
data 
supplied 
by 
our 
ceding 
companies 
and 
brokers 
and 
we 
employ 
 actuarial and statistical 
projections. 
The information received 
from our ceding companies 
is not always timely or 
 accurate, 
which 
can 
contribute 
to 
inaccuracies 
in 
our 
loss 
projections. 
Because 
of 
the 
uncertainties 
that 
 surround 
our estimates 
of loss 
and LAE 
reserves, 
we 
cannot 
be certain 
that 
ultimate 
losses 
and LAE 
payments 
 will not exceed our estimates. 
If our reserves are deficient, we 
would be required to increase 
loss reserves in the 
 period in 
which such 
deficiencies are 
identified which 
would cause 
a charge 
to our 
earnings and 
a reduction 
of 
 capital. 
During the past five 
calendar years, 
the reserve re-estimation 
process resulted in 
an increase to our 
pre-
 tax net income in 2022, 2021 and 2019 and resulted 
in a decrease to our pre-tax net income 
in 2020 and 2018: 

 Calendar year: 
 Effect on pre-tax net income 
 (Dollars in millions) 
 2022 
 
 1 
 increase 
 2021 
 9 
 increase 
 2020 
 401 
 decrease 
 2019 
 64 
 increase 
 2018 
 387 
 decrease 
 The difficulty 
in 
estimating 
our 
reserves 
is significantly 
more challenging 
as 
it 
relates 
to 
reserving 
for 
potential 
 A E liabilities. 
At year-end 2022, 
1.3 of our gross 
reserves were comprised 
of A E reserves. 
A E liabilities are 
 especially hard 
to estimate 
for many 
reasons, including 
the long 
delays between 
exposure and 
manifestation 
of 
 any 
bodily 
injury 
or 
property 
damage, 
difficulty 
in 
identifying 
the 
source 
of 
the 
asbestos 
or 
environmental 
 contamination, 
long 
reporting 
delays 
and 
difficulty 
in 
properly 
allocating 
liability 
for 
the 
asbestos 
or 
 environmental 
damage. 
Legal 
tactics 
and judicial 
and legislative 
developments 
affecting 
the scope 
of insurers 
 liability, 
which 
can 
be 
difficult 
to 
predict, 
also 
contribute 
to 
uncertainties 
in 
estimating 
reserves 
for 
A E 
 liabilities. 

 The 
failure 
to 
accurately 
assess 
underwriting 
risk 
and 
establish 
adequate 
premium 
rates 
could 
reduce 
our 
net 
 income or result in a net loss. 

 Our success depends on our ability to accurately 
assess the risks associated with the businesses 
on which the risk 
 is retained. 
If we fail to accurately 
assess the risks we retain, we may 
fail to establish adequate 
premium rates to 
 cover our losses and LAE. 
This could reduce our net income and even result 
in a net loss. 

 In addition, 
losses may 
arise from 
events or 
exposures that 
are not 
anticipated when 
the coverage 
is priced. 
In 
 addition to unanticipated events, 
we also face the unanticipated expansion 
of our exposures, particularly in long-
 tail liability lines. 
An example 
of this is the 
expansion over time 
of the scope 
of insurers 
legal liability within 
the 
 mass tort arena, particularly for A E exposures 
discussed above. 

 Decreases in pricing for property and casualty reinsurance 
and insurance could reduce our net income. 

 The worldwide 
reinsurance 
and insurance 
businesses 
are highly 
competitive, 
as well 
as cyclical 
by 
product 
and 
 market. 
These 
cycles, 
as 
well 
as 
other 
factors 
that 
influence 
aggregate 
supply 
and 
demand 
for 
property 
and 
 casualty insurance 
and reinsurance products, 
are outside of our 
control. 
The supply of (re)insurance 
is driven by 
 prevailing 
prices 
and 
levels 
of 
capacity 
that 
may 
fluctuate 
in 
response 
to 
a 
number 
of 
factors 
including 
large 
 catastrophic 
losses and investment 
returns being 
realized in 
the insurance 
industry. 
Demand for 
(re)insurance is 
 influenced by 
underwriting results 
of insurers 
and insureds, 
including catastrophe 
losses, and 
prevailing general 

27 
 economic 
conditions. 
If 
any 
of 
these 
factors 
were 
to 
result 
in 
a 
decline 
in 
the 
demand 
for 
(re)insurance 
or 
an 
 overall increase in (re)insurance 
capacity, our 
net income could decrease. 
 If 
rating 
agencies 
downgrade 
the 
ratings 
of 
our 
insurance 
subsidiaries, 
future 
prospects 
for 
growth 
and 
 profitability could be significantly and adversely 
affected. 

 Our active insurance 
company subsidiaries 
currently hold financial 
strength ratings 
assigned by third-party rating 
 agencies 
which 
assess 
and 
rate 
the 
claims 
paying 
ability 
and 
financial 
strength 
of 
insurers 
and 
reinsurers. 

 Financial 
strength 
ratings 
are 
used 
by 
cedents, 
agents 
and 
brokers 
to 
assess 
the 
financial 
strength 
and 
credit 
 quality of reinsurers 
and insurers. 
A downgrade 
or withdrawal 
of any 
of these ratings 
could adversely 
affect our 
 ability 
to 
market 
our 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
products, 
our 
ability 
to 
compete 
with 
other 
reinsurers 
and 
 insurers, 
and 
could 
have 
a 
material 
and 
adverse 
effect 
on 
our 
ability 
to 
write 
new 
business 
that 
in 
turn 
could 
 impact our profitability and operating 
results. 
In December 2021, S P announced proposed 
changes to its rating 
 methodologies. 
The 
proposed 
changes 
have 
not 
been 
finalized, 
so 
the 
impact, 
if 
any, 
that 
these 
changes 
may 
 have on our financial strength 
ratings is unknown. 
 Consistent 
with 
market 
practice, 
much 
of 
our 
treaty 
reinsurance 
business 
allows 
the 
ceding 
company 
to 
 terminate 
the 
contract 
or 
seek 
collateralization 
of our 
obligations 
in 
the 
event 
of a 
rating 
downgrade 
below 
a 
 certain 
threshold. 
The termination 
provision 
would 
generally 
be triggered 
if a 
rating 
fell 
below 
A.M. Best s 
A- 
 rating 
level. 
To 
a 
lesser 
extent, 
Everest 
Re 
also 
has 
modest 
exposure 
to 
reinsurance 
contracts 
that 
contain 
 provisions 
for 
obligatory 
funding 
of 
outstanding 
liabilities 
in 
the 
event 
of 
a 
rating 
agency 
downgrade. 
Those 
 provisions would also generally 
be triggered if Everest Re s 
rating fell below A.M. Best s 
A- rating level. 

 The 
failure 
of 
our 
insureds, 
intermediaries 
and 
reinsurers 
to 
satisfy 
their 
obligations 
to 
us 
could 
reduce 
our 
 income. 

 In 
accordance 
with 
industry 
practice, 
we 
have 
uncollateralized 
receivables 
from 
insureds, 
agents 
and 
brokers 
 and/or rely 
on agents 
and brokers 
to process 
our payments. 
We may 
not be 
able to 
collect amounts 
due from 
 insureds, agents and brokers, 
resulting in a reduction to net income. 
 We are 
subject to 
credit risk 
of reinsurers 
in connection 
with retrocessional 
arrangements 
because the 
transfer 
 of risk to a 
reinsurer does not 
relieve us of 
our liability to the insured. 
In addition, reinsurers 
may be unwilling 
to 
 pay 
us 
even 
though 
they 
are 
able 
to 
do 
so. 
The 
failure 
of 
one 
or 
more 
of 
our 
reinsurers 
to 
honor 
their 
 obligations 
to us 
in a 
timely fashion 
would impact 
our cash 
flow and 
reduce our 
net income 
and could 
cause us 
 to incur a significant loss. 
 If 
we 
are 
unable 
or 
choose 
not 
to 
purchase 
reinsurance 
and 
transfer 
risk 
to 
the 
reinsurance 
markets, 
our 
net 
 income could be reduced or we could incur a net 
loss in the event of unusual loss experience. 
 We 
are 
generally 
less reliant 
on the 
purchase 
of reinsurance 
than many 
of our 
competitors, 
in part 
because of 
 our strategic 
emphasis on 
underwriting discipline 
and management 
of the 
cycles inherent 
in our 
business. 
We 
 try to 
separate 
our risk 
taking process 
from our 
risk mitigation 
process in 
order to 
avoid developing 
too great 
a 
 reliance on 
reinsurance. 
With the 
expansion 
of the 
capital 
markets 
into insurance 
linked 
financial instruments, 
 we 
increased 
our 
use 
of 
capital 
market 
products 
for 
catastrophe 
reinsurance. 
In 
addition, 
we 
have 
increased 
 some of 
our quota 
share contracts 
with larger 
retrocessions. 
The percentage 
of business 
that we 
reinsure may 
 vary 
considerably 
from 
year 
to 
year, 
depending 
on 
our 
view 
of 
the 
relationship 
between 
cost 
and 
expected 
 benefit for the contract period.

 Our industry is highly competitive and we may not be able 
to compete as successfully in the future. 
 Our industry 
is highly competitive 
and subject 
to pricing cycles 
that can 
be pronounced. 
We compete 
globally in 
 the 
United 
States, 
Bermuda 
and 
international 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
markets 
with 
numerous 
competitors. 

 Our 
competitors 
include 
independent 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
companies, 
subsidiaries 
or 
affiliates 
of 
 established 
worldwide 
insurance 
companies, 
reinsurance 
departments 
of 
certain 
insurance 
companies 
and 
 domestic and international underwriting operations, 
including underwriting syndicates at 
Lloyd s 
of London. 

 According to 
S P, 
Everest 
ranks among 
the top 
ten global 
property 
casualty reinsurance 
groups, 
where more 
 than two-thirds 
of the 
market share 
is concentrated. 
The worldwide 
net premium 
written by 
the Top 
40 global 
 reinsurance groups 
for both life and 
non-life business was 
estimated to be 
 292 billion in 2022 according 
to data 
 compiled by 
S P. 
In addition to 
competitors the 
entry of alternative 
capital market 
products and 
new company 
 formations provide additional sources 
of reinsurance and insurance capacity. 
 We are dependent on our key 
personnel. 
 Our success 
has been, 
and will 
continue to 
be, dependent 
on our 
ability to 
retain 
the services 
of our 
Chairman, 
 Joseph 
V. 
Taranto 
(age 
73) 
and 
existing 
key 
executive 
officers 
and 
to 
attract 
and 
retain 
additional 
qualified 
 personnel 
in the 
future. 
The loss 
of the 
services of 
any 
key 
executive 
officer or 
the inability 
to hire 
and retain 
 other highly 
qualified personnel 
in the 
future could 
adversely 
affect 
our ability 
to conduct 
business. 
Generally, 
 we 
consider 
key 
executive 
officers 
to 
be 
those 
individuals 
who 
have 
the 
greatest 
influence 
in 
setting 
overall 
 policy 
and 
controlling 
operations: 
President 
and 
Chief 
Executive 
Officer, 
Juan 
C. 
Andrade 
(age 
57); 
Executive 
 Vice 
President 
and 
Chief 
Financial 
Officer, 
Mark 
Kociancic 
(age 
53), 
Executive 
Vice 
President, 
Group, 
Chief 
 Operating 
Officer and 
Head of 
Reinsurance 
Division, 
Jim Williamson 
(age 49), 
Executive 
Vice President, 
General 
 Counsel, 
Chief 
Compliance 
Officer 
and 
Secretary, 
Sanjoy 
Mukherjee 
(age 
56) 
and 
Executive 
Vice 
President, 
 President 
and 
Chief 
Executive 
Officer 
of 
the 
Everest 
Insurance

Division, 
Mike 
Karmilowicz 
(age 
54). 
We 
have 
 employment contracts 
with all 
of our 
key 
officers, 
which contain 
automatic renewal 
provisions 
that provide 
for 
 the contracts 
to continue 
indefinitely unless 
sooner terminated 
in accordance 
with the contract 
or as 
otherwise 
 may be agreed. 
 Special 
considerations 
apply 
to 
our 
Bermuda 
operations. 
Under 
Bermuda 
law, 
non-Bermudians, 
other 
than 
 spouses of Bermudians 
and individuals holding 
permanent or working 
resident certificates, 
are not 
permitted to 
 engage in any gainful occupation 
in Bermuda without a work permit issued by the Bermuda 
government. 
A work 
 permit 
is 
only 
granted 
or 
extended 
if 
the 
employer 
can 
show 
that, 
after 
a 
proper 
public 
advertisement, 
no 
 Bermudian, spouse 
of a Bermudian 
or individual holding 
a permanent or 
working resident 
certificate is 
available 
 who meets the minimum standards 
reasonably required for 
the position. 
The Bermuda government places 
a six-
 year term 
limit on individuals 
with work 
permits, subject 
to specified 
exemptions 
for persons 
deemed to be 
key 
 employees 
of 
businesses 
with 
a 
significant 
physical 
presence 
in 
Bermuda. 
Currently, 
all 
our 
Bermuda-based 
 professional 
employees who 
require work 
permits have 
been granted 
permits by the 
Bermuda government 
that 
 expire at various times between 
February 2024 and October 2027. 

 Our 
investment 
values 
and 
investment 
income 
could 
decline 
because 
they 
are 
exposed 
to 
interest 
rate, 
credit, 
 and market risks. 
 A significant 
portion of 
our investment 
portfolio consists 
of fixed 
income securities 
and smaller 
portions consist 
 of 
equity 
securities 
and 
other 
investments. 
The 
fair 
value 
of 
our 
invested 
assets 
and 
associated 
investment 
 income 
fluctuate 
depending 
on 
general 
economic 
and 
market 
conditions. 
For 
example, 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
our 
 predominant 
fixed 
income 
portfolio 
generally 
increases 
or decreases 
inversely 
to 
fluctuations 
in interest 
rates. 

 The fair 
value of 
our fixed 
income securities 
could also 
decrease as 
a result 
of a 
downturn in 
the business 
cycle 
 that causes 
the credit quality 
of such securities 
to deteriorate. 
The net investment 
income that 
we realize 
from 
 future investments in fixed 
income securities will generally increase 
or decrease with interest 
rates. 

29 
 Interest 
rate 
fluctuations 
also 
can 
cause 
net 
investment 
income 
from 
fixed 
income 
investments 
that 
carry 
 prepayment 
risk, 
such 
as 
mortgage-backed 
and 
other 
asset-backed 
securities, 
to 
differ 
from 
the 
income 
 anticipated 
from 
those 
securities 
at 
the 
time 
of 
purchase. 
In 
addition, 
if 
issuers 
of 
individual 
investments 
are 
 unable to meet their obligations, investment 
income will be reduced and realized capital 
losses may arise. 
 The majority 
of our 
fixed income 
securities are 
classified as 
available for 
sale and 
temporary 
changes in 
the fair 
 value 
of these 
investments 
are reflected 
as changes 
to 
our shareholders 
equity. 
Our actively 
managed 
equity 
 security 
portfolios 
are 
fair 
valued 
and 
any 
changes 
in 
fair 
value 
are 
reflected 
as 
net 
realized 
capital 
gains 
or 
 losses. 
As a result, a decline in the value of our securities reduces 
our capital or could cause us to incur a loss. 

 As a 
part of 
our ongoing 
analysis of 
our investment 
portfolio, we 
are required 
to assess 
current expected 
credit 
 losses 
for 
all 
held-to-maturity 
securities 
and 
evaluate 
expected 
credit 
losses 
for 
available-for-sale 
securities 
 when 
fair 
value 
is 
below 
amortized 
cost, 
which 
considers 
reasonable 
and 
supportable 
forecasts 
of 
future 
 economic conditions in addition to information 
about past events and current 
conditions. This analysis requires 
a 
 high degree of 
judgment. Financial assets 
with similar risk characteristics 
and relevant 
historical loss 
information 
 are included 
in the development 
of an estimate 
of expected 
lifetime losses. 
Declines in relevant 
stock and 
other 
 financial markets 
and other 
factors 
impacting the 
value of 
our investments 
could result 
in an 
adverse 
effect 
on 
 our net income and 
other financial results 
 We have 
invested 
a portion of 
our investment 
portfolio in 
equity securities. 
The value 
of these assets 
fluctuates 
 with changes in the markets. 
In times of economic weakness, 
the fair value of 
these assets may decline, 
and may 
 negatively 
impact 
net 
income. 
We 
also 
invest 
in 
non-traditional 
investments 
which 
have 
different 
risk 
 characteristics 
than traditional 
fixed income 
and equity 
securities. These 
alternative 
investments 
are comprised 
 primarily 
of 
private 
equity 
limited 
partnerships. 
The 
changes 
in 
value 
and 
investment 
income/(loss) 
for 
these 
 partnerships may be more volatile 
than over-the-counter securities. 

 Prolonged and 
severe disruptions 
in the overall 
public and 
private debt 
and equity 
markets, such 
as occurred 
in 
 early 
2020 
related 
to 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic, 
could 
result 
in 
significant 
realized 
and 
unrealized 
losses 
in 
our 
 investment portfolio. 
There could also 
be disruption in individual 
market sectors, 
such as occurred in the 
energy 
 sector in 
recent years. 
Such declines 
in the 
financial markets 
could result 
in significant 
realized 
and unrealized 
 losses 
on investments 
and could 
have 
a material 
adverse 
impact on 
our results 
of operations, 
equity, 
business 
 and insurer financial strength and 
debt ratings. 

 We may experience 
foreign currency exchange losses that 
reduce our net income and capital levels. 
 Through 
our 
Bermuda 
and 
international 
operations, 
we 
conduct 
business 
in 
a 
variety 
of 
foreign 
(non-U.S.) 
 currencies, 
principally 
the 
Euro, 
the 
British 
pound, 
the 
Canadian 
dollar, 
and 
the 
Singapore 
dollar. 
Assets, 
 liabilities, 
revenues 
and 
expenses 
denominated 
in 
foreign 
currencies 
are 
exposed 
to 
changes 
in 
currency 
 exchange 
rates. 
Our reporting 
currency is 
the U.S. 
dollar, 
and exchange 
rate 
fluctuations, 
especially relative 
to 
 the U.S. dollar, 
may materially 
impact our results and 
financial position. 
In 2022, we wrote 
approximately 
25.8 
 of our 
coverages 
in non-U.S. 
currencies; 
as of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
we 
maintained 
approximately 
19.3 
of our 
 investment portfolio in investments 
denominated in non-U.S. currencies. 

 We are subject to cybersecurity risks 
that could negatively impact our business operations. 

 We 
are 
dependent 
upon 
our 
information 
technology 
platform, 
including 
our 
processing 
systems, 
data 
and 
 electronic transmissions 
in our 
business operations. 
Security breaches 
could expose 
us to 
the loss 
or misuse 
of 
 our 
information, 
litigation 
and 
potential 
liability. 
In 
addition, 
cyber 
incidents 
that 
impact 
the 
availability, 
 reliability, 
speed, accuracy or 
other proper functioning 
of these systems 
could have a 
significant negative 
impact 
 on our 
operations and 
possibly our 
results. 
An incident 
could also 
result in 
a violation 
of applicable 
privacy and 
 other laws, damage 
our reputation, 
cause a loss 
of customers 
or give rise to 
monetary fines and 
other penalties, 
 which could be 
significant. 
Management is not 
aware of a 
cybersecurity incident 
that has had 
a material impact 
 on our operations. 

30 
 The NAIC 
has 
adopted 
an 
Insurance 
Data 
Security 
Model 
Law, 
which, 
when 
adopted 
by 
the 
states 
will require 
 insurers, 
insurance 
producers 
and 
other 
entities 
required 
to 
be licensed 
under 
state 
insurance 
laws 
to 
comply 
 with certain requirements 
under state 
insurance laws, such 
as developing and 
maintaining a written 
information 
 security program, 
conducting risk assessments 
and overseeing the 
data 
security practices of 
third-party vendors. 

 In 
addition, 
certain 
state 
insurance 
regulators 
are 
developing 
or 
have 
developed 
regulations 
that 
may 
impose 
 regulatory requirements 
relating to cybersecurity 
on insurance and 
reinsurance companies 
(potentially including 
 insurance 
and 
reinsurance 
companies 
that 
are 
not 
domiciled, 
but 
are 
licensed, 
in 
the 
relevant 
state). 
For 
 example, the New York 
State Department of 
Financial Services has a 
regulation pertaining to 
cybersecurity for all 
 banking and 
insurance 
entities under 
its jurisdiction, 
which was 
effective 
as of 
March 1, 
2017, which 
applies to 
 us. 
We 
cannot 
predict 
the 
impact these 
laws 
and regulations 
will have 
on our 
business, 
financial 
condition 
or 
 results 
of operations, 
but our 
insurance 
and reinsurance 
companies 
could 
incur additional 
costs 
resulting 
from 
 compliance with such laws and regulations. 

 RISKS RELATING TO 
REGULATION 
 Insurance 
laws 
and 
regulations 
restrict 
our 
ability 
to 
operate 
and 
any 
failure 
to 
comply 
with 
those 
laws 
and 
 regulations could have a material adverse effect on 
our business. 
 We are 
subject to 
extensive 
and increasing 
regulation under 
U.S., state 
and foreign 
insurance laws. 
These laws 
 limit the 
amount 
of dividends 
that 
can 
be paid 
to 
us 
by 
our operating 
subsidiaries, 
impose 
restrictions 
on 
the 
 amount and type of 
investments that 
we can hold, prescribe 
solvency, 
accounting and internal 
control standards 
 that 
must 
be 
met 
and 
maintained 
and 
require 
us 
to 
maintain 
reserves. 
These 
laws 
also 
require 
disclosure 
of 
 material 
inter-affiliate 
transactions 
and 
require 
prior 
approval 
of 
 extraordinary 
transactions. 
Such 
 extraordinary 
transactions 
include 
declaring 
dividends 
from 
operating 
subsidiaries 
that 
exceed 
statutory 
 thresholds. 
These 
laws 
also 
generally 
require 
approval 
of 
changes 
of 
control 
of 
insurance 
companies. 
The 
 application 
of these 
laws could 
affect our 
liquidity and 
ability to 
pay dividends, 
interest 
and other 
payments on 
 securities, as 
applicable, and 
could restrict 
our ability to 
expand our 
business operations 
through acquisitions 
of 
 new 
insurance 
subsidiaries. 
We 
may 
not 
have 
or 
maintain 
all 
required 
licenses 
and 
approvals 
or 
fully 
comply 
 with the wide variety of applicable laws and 
regulations or the relevant authority s 
interpretation of the laws and 
 regulations. 
If we do 
not have 
the requisite 
licenses and 
approvals 
or do 
not comply 
with applicable 
regulatory 
 requirements, 
the 
insurance 
regulatory 
authorities 
could 
preclude 
or 
temporarily 
suspend 
us 
from 
carrying 
on 
 some 
or 
all 
of 
our 
activities 
or 
monetarily 
penalize 
us. 
These 
types 
of 
actions 
could 
have 
a 
material 
adverse 
 effect 
on 
our 
business. 
To 
date, 
no 
material 
fine, penalty 
or 
restriction 
has been 
imposed 
on us 
for 
failure 
to 
 comply with any insurance law or regulation. 
 As 
a 
result 
of 
the 
previous 
dislocation 
of 
the 
financial 
markets, 
Congress 
and 
the 
previous 
Presidential 
 administration 
in the United 
States implemented 
changes in 
the way 
the financial services 
industry is 
regulated. 

 Some of these changes are also impacting the insurance 
industry. 
For example, the U.S. Treasury 
established the 
 Federal Insurance 
Office with 
the authority 
to monitor all 
aspects of the 
insurance sector, 
monitor the 
extent to 
 which 
traditionally 
underserved 
communities 
and 
consumers 
have 
access 
to 
affordable 
non-health 
insurance 
 products, to 
represent the 
United States 
on prudential 
aspects of international 
insurance matters, 
to assist 
with 
 administration 
of the 
Terrorism 
Risk 
Insurance 
Program 
and 
to 
advise 
on 
important 
national 
and 
international 
 insurance 
matters. 
In 
addition, 
several 
European 
regulatory 
bodies 
are 
in 
process 
of 
updating 
existing 
or 
 developing new 
capital adequacy 
directives for 
insurers 
and reinsurers. 
The future 
impact of 
such initiatives 
or 
 new 
initiatives 
from 
the 
current 
Government 
Administration, 
if 
any, 
on 
our 
operation, 
net 
income 
(loss) 
or 
 financial condition cannot be determined at this 
time. 

 Regulatory challenges in the United States 
could adversely affect the ability of Bermuda Re to 
conduct business. 
 Bermuda Re does 
not intend to 
be licensed or admitted 
as an insurer or 
reinsurer in any 
U.S. jurisdiction. 
Under 
 current 
law, 
Bermuda 
Re 
generally 
will 
be 
permitted 
to 
reinsure 
U.S. 
risks 
from 
its 
office 
in 
Bermuda 
without 
 obtaining 
those licenses. 
However, 
the 
insurance 
and reinsurance 
regulatory 
framework 
is subject 
to 
periodic 

31 
 legislative 
review 
and 
revision. 
In 
the 
past, 
there 
have 
been 
congressional 
and 
other 
initiatives 
in 
the 
United 
 States regarding 
increased supervision 
and regulation of 
the insurance industry, 
including proposals to 
supervise 
 and 
regulate 
reinsurers 
domiciled 
outside 
the 
United 
States. 
If 
Bermuda 
Re 
were 
to 
become 
subject 
to 
any 
 insurance 
laws 
of 
the 
United 
States 
or 
any 
U.S. 
state 
at 
any 
time 
in 
the 
future, 
it 
might 
be 
required 
to 
post 
 deposits or maintain 
minimum surplus levels 
and might be 
prohibited from 
engaging in lines 
of business or 
from 
 writing some types 
of policies. 
Complying with those 
laws could 
have a 
material adverse 
effect on 
our ability to 
 conduct business in Bermuda and international 
markets. 

 Bermuda Re may need to be licensed or admitted 
in additional jurisdictions to develop its business. 
 As 
Bermuda 
Re s 
business 
develops, 
it 
will 
monitor 
the 
need 
to 
obtain 
licenses 
in 
jurisdictions 
other 
than 
 Bermuda and the U.K., where 
it has an authorized branch, 
in order to comply with applicable 
law or to be able to 
 engage in additional 
insurance-related activities. 
In addition, Bermuda Re 
may be at 
a competitive disadvantage 
 in 
jurisdictions 
where 
it 
is 
not 
licensed 
or 
does 
not 
enjoy 
an 
exemption 
from 
licensing 
relative 
to 
competitors 
 that 
are 
so 
licensed 
or 
exempt 
from 
licensing. 
Bermuda 
Re 
may 
not 
be able 
to 
obtain 
any 
additional 
licenses 
 that 
it 
determines 
are 
necessary 
or 
desirable. 
Furthermore, 
the 
process 
of 
obtaining 
those 
licenses 
is 
often 
 costly and may take 
a long time. 
 Bermuda Re s 
ability to write 
reinsurance may be 
severely limited if 
it is unable to 
arrange for security to 
back its 
 reinsurance. 
 Many 
jurisdictions 
do not 
permit insurance 
companies 
to take 
credit 
for reinsurance 
obtained 
from unlicensed 
 or 
non-admitted 
insurers 
on 
their 
statutory 
financial 
statements 
without 
appropriate 
security. 
Bermuda 
Re s 
 reinsurance 
clients 
typically 
require 
it 
to 
post 
a 
letter 
of 
credit 
or 
enter 
into 
other 
security 
arrangements. 
If 
 Bermuda 
Re 
is 
unable 
to 
obtain 
or 
maintain 
a 
letter 
of 
credit 
facility 
on 
commercially 
acceptable 
terms 
or 
is 
 unable 
to 
arrange 
for 
other 
types 
of 
security, 
its 
ability 
to 
operate 
its 
business 
may 
be 
severely 
limited. 
If 
 Bermuda 
Re 
defaults 
on 
any 
letter 
of 
credit 
that 
it 
obtains, 
it 
may 
be 
required 
to 
prematurely 
liquidate 
a 
 substantial portion of its investment 
portfolio and other assets pledged as collateral. 
 RISKS RELATING TO 
GROUP S SECURITIES 
 Because of our holding company 
structure, our ability to pay 
dividends, interest and 
principal is dependent on our 
 receipt of dividends, loan payments and other funds from our subsidiaries. 
 Group 
and 
Holdings 
are 
holding 
companies, 
each 
of 
whose 
most 
significant 
asset 
consists 
of 
the 
stock 
of 
its 
 operating 
subsidiaries. 
As 
a 
result, 
each 
of 
Group s 
and 
Holdings 
ability 
to 
pay 
dividends, 
interest 
or 
other 
 payments on 
its securities in 
the future will 
depend on the 
earnings and cash 
flows of the 
operating subsidiaries 
 and the 
ability of 
the subsidiaries 
to pay 
dividends 
or to 
advance or 
repay 
funds to 
it. 
This ability 
is subject 
to 
 general economic, financial, competitive, 
regulatory and other factors 
beyond our control. 
Payment of dividends 
 and advances 
and repayments 
from some 
of the 
operating 
subsidiaries are 
regulated 
by U.S., 
state 
and foreign 
 insurance 
laws 
and 
regulatory 
restrictions, 
including 
minimum 
solvency 
and 
liquidity 
thresholds. 
Accordingly, 
 the operating 
subsidiaries may 
not be able to 
pay dividends 
or advance or 
repay funds 
to Group and 
Holdings in 
 the future, which could prevent 
us from paying dividends, interest 
or other payments on our securities. 

 Provisions in 
Group s 
bye-laws could 
have an 
anti-takeover 
effect, which 
could diminish 
the value 
of its 
common 
 shares. 

 Group s 
bye-laws 
contain 
provisions 
that 
could 
delay 
or 
prevent 
a 
change 
of control 
that 
a 
shareholder 
might 
 consider favorable. 
The effect 
of these 
provisions 
could be 
to prevent 
a shareholder 
from receiving 
the benefit 
 from 
any 
premium 
over 
the 
market 
price 
of 
our 
common 
shares 
offered 
by 
a 
bidder 
in 
a 
potential 
takeover. 

 Even 
in the 
absence 
of an 
attempt 
to 
effect 
a 
change 
in management 
or 
a 
takeover 
attempt, 
these 
provisions 
 may 
adversely 
affect 
the 
prevailing 
market 
price 
of 
our 
common 
shares 
if 
they 
are 
viewed 
as 
discouraging 
 takeover attempts 
in the future. 

32 
 For example, Group s 
bye-laws contain the 
following provisions that could have 
an anti-takeover effect: 

the total voting 
power of any 
shareholder owning more 
than 9.9 of the 
common shares will 
be reduced to 
 9.9 of the total voting power of the common shares; 
 
 the board of 
directors may 
decline to register 
any transfer 
of common shares 
if it has reason 
to believe that 
 the transfer would result 
in: 
 i.)
 any person that 
is not an investment 
company beneficially 
owning more than 5.0 
of any class 
 of the issued and outstanding share capital 
of Group, 
 ii.)
 any 
person 
holding 
controlled 
shares 
in 
excess 
of 
9.9 
of 
any 
class 
of 
the 
issued 
and 
 outstanding share capital 
of Group, or 
 iii.)
 any adverse 
tax, regulatory 
or legal consequences 
to Group, any 
of its subsidiaries 
or any of 
its 
 shareholders; 

Group also has the 
option to redeem or purchase 
all or part of a shareholder s 
common shares to 
the extent 
 the 
board 
of 
directors 
determines 
it 
is 
necessary 
or 
advisable 
to 
avoid 
or 
cure 
any 
adverse 
or 
potential 
 adverse consequences if: 
 i.)
 any person that is not an investment 
company beneficially owns more than 
5.0 of any class of 
 the issued and outstanding share capital 
of Group, 

ii.)
 any person 
holds controlled shares 
in excess of 
9.9 of any class 
of the issued and 
outstanding 
 share capital of Group, or 

iii.)
 share ownership 
by any 
person may 
result in 
adverse tax, 
regulatory or 
legal consequences 
to 
 Group, any of its subsidiaries or any 
other shareholder. 
 The 
Board 
of 
Directors 
has 
indicated 
that 
it 
will 
apply 
these 
bye-law 
provisions 
in 
such 
manner 
that 
 passive 
 institutional investors 
will be treated similarly 
to investment 
companies. 
For this purpose, passive 
institutional 
 investors 
include all 
persons who 
are eligible, 
pursuant 
to Rule 
13d-1(b)(1) under 
the U.S. 
Securities Exchange 
 Act 
of 
1934, the 
Exchange 
Act 
to 
file 
a 
short-form 
statement 
on 
Schedule 
13G, 
other 
than 
an 
insurance 
 company or any parent 
holding company or control person 
of an insurance company. 

 Applicable insurance laws may also have an anti-takeover 
effect. 
 Before a 
person can 
acquire control 
of a U.S. 
insurance company, 
prior written 
approval must 
be obtained 
from 
 the 
insurance 
commissioner 
of the 
state 
where 
that 
insurance 
company 
is 
domiciled 
or 
deemed 
commercially 
 domiciled. 
Prior 
to 
granting 
approval 
of an 
application 
to acquire 
control 
of a 
domestic 
insurance 
company, 
a 
 state 
insurance 
commissioner 
will consider 
such 
factors 
as the 
financial strength 
of the 
applicant, 
the integrity 
 and competence 
of the 
applicant s 
board of 
directors 
and executive 
officers, 
the acquiror s 
plans for 
the future 
 operations of the insurance 
company and any 
anti-competitive results 
that may arise from 
the consummation of 
 the 
acquisition 
of control. 
Because any 
person 
who acquired 
control 
of Group 
would 
thereby 
acquire 
indirect 
 control 
of 
its 
insurance 
company 
subsidiaries 
in 
the 
U.S., 
the 
insurance 
change 
of 
control 
laws 
of 
Delaware, 
 California 
and 
Georgia 
would 
apply 
to 
such 
a 
transaction. 
This 
could 
have 
the 
effect 
of 
delaying 
or 
even 
 preventing such a change of control. 

33 
 The ownership of common 
shares of Group by Everest 
Re Advisors, Ltd., 
a direct subsidiary of Group 
may have an 
 impact on securing approval of shareholder proposals that Group s 
management supports. 

 As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
Everest 
Re 
Advisors, 
Ltd. 
(Bermuda) 
owned 
9,719,971 
or 
19.9 
of 
the 
outstanding 
 common shares of Group. 
Under Group s 
bye-laws, the total voting 
power of any shareholder owning more 
than 
 9.9 of the 
common shares 
is reduced 
to 9.9 
of the 
total voting 
power of 
the common 
shares. 
Nevertheless, 
 Everest 
Re Advisors, 
Ltd., which 
is controlled 
by Group, 
has the ability 
to vote 
9.9 of the 
total voting 
power of 
 Group s common 
shares. 

 Investors in Group may have more difficulty in protecting 
their interests than investors in 
a U.S. corporation. 
 The Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda (the Companies Act ), differs 
in material respects from 
the laws applicable 
 to 
U.S. 
corporations 
and 
their 
shareholders. 
The 
following 
is 
a 
summary 
of 
material 
differences 
between 
the 
 Companies 
Act, 
as modified 
in 
some 
instances 
by 
provisions 
of Group s 
bye-laws, 
and Delaware 
corporate 
law 
 that 
could 
make 
it 
more 
difficult 
for 
investors 
in 
Group 
to 
protect 
their 
interests 
than 
investors 
in 
a 
U.S. 
 corporation. 
Because the 
following statements 
are summaries, 
they do 
not address 
all aspects 
of Bermuda 
law 
 that may be relevant to 
Group and its shareholders. 
 Alternate Directors. 
Group s bye 
-laws provide, 
as permitted by 
Bermuda law, 
that each director 
may appoint 
an 
 alternate 
director, 
who 
shall 
have 
the 
power 
to 
attend 
and 
vote 
at 
any 
meeting 
of 
the 
board 
of 
directors 
or 
 committee at 
which that director 
is not personally 
present and to 
sign written consents 
in place of that 
director. 

 Delaware 
law 
permits 
a 
director 
to 
appoint 
another 
director 
as 
an 
alternate 
to 
attend 
any 
board 
committee 
 meeting. 
However, 
Delaware 
law does 
not provide 
for the 
designation 
of alternate 
directors 
with authority 
to 
 attend or vote at a meeting of 
the board of directors. 

 Committees of 
the Board 
of Directors. 
Group s 
bye-laws provide, 
as permitted 
by Bermuda 
law, 
that the 
board 
 of directors 
may delegate 
any of 
its powers 
to committees 
that the 
board appoints, 
and those 
committees may 
 consist 
partly 
or 
entirely 
of 
non-directors. 
Delaware 
law 
allows 
the 
board 
of 
directors 
of 
a 
corporation 
to 
 delegate many of its powers 
to committees, but those committees 
may consist only of directors. 
 Interested 
Directors. 
Bermuda law 
and Group s 
bye-laws 
provide 
that if 
a director 
has a 
personal 
interest 
in a 
 transaction to 
which the company 
is also a party 
and if the director 
discloses the nature 
of this personal 
interest 
 at the first 
opportunity, 
either at a 
meeting of directors 
or in writing 
to the directors, 
then the company 
will not 
 be able to 
declare the transaction 
void solely 
due to the 
existence of 
that personal 
interest and 
the director 
will 
 not be liable 
to the company 
for any 
profit realized 
from the 
transaction. 
In addition, 
after a director 
has made 
 the 
declaration 
of 
interest 
referred 
to 
above, 
he 
or 
she 
is 
allowed 
to 
be 
counted 
for 
purposes 
of determining 
 whether a quorum 
is present and 
to vote 
on a transaction 
in which he 
or she has 
an interest, 
unless disqualified 
 from doing so by 
the chairman of the relevant 
board meeting. 
Under Delaware law, 
an interested 
director could 
 be held liable 
for a 
transaction in 
which that 
director derived 
an improper 
personal benefit. 
Additionally, 
under 
 Delaware 
law, 
a corporation 
may be 
able to 
declare a 
transaction 
with an 
interested 
director to 
be void 
unless 
 one of the following conditions is fulfilled: 
 
 the material 
facts as 
to the 
interested 
director s 
relationship 
or interests 
are disclosed 
or are 
known to 
the 
 board 
of 
directors 
and 
the 
board 
in 
good 
faith 
authorizes 
the 
transaction 
by 
the 
affirmative 
vote 
of 
a 
 majority of the disinterested directors; 
 
 the material facts are 
disclosed or are known to 
the shareholders entitled to 
vote on the transaction 
and the 
 transaction is specifically approved 
in good faith by the holders of a majority of the voting 
shares; or 
 
 the transaction is fair to the corporation 
as of the time it is authorized, approved or 
ratified. 
 Transactions 
with Significant Shareholders. 
As a Bermuda company, 
Group may 
enter into business 
transactions 
 with 
its 
significant 
shareholders, 
including 
asset 
sales, 
in 
which 
a 
significant 
shareholder 
receives, 
or 
could 

34 
 receive, 
a 
financial 
benefit 
that 
is 
greater 
than 
that 
received, 
or 
to 
be 
received, 
by 
other 
shareholders 
with 
 prior approval 
from Group s 
board 
of directors 
but without 
obtaining 
prior approval 
from the 
shareholders. 
In 
 the case of an amalgamation, in which 
two or more companies join together 
and continue as a single company, 
a 
 resolution of 
shareholders approved 
by a majority 
of at least 
75 of the 
votes cast 
is required in 
addition to the 
 approval 
of 
the 
board 
of 
directors, 
except 
in 
the 
case 
of 
an 
amalgamation 
with 
and 
between 
wholly-owned 
 subsidiaries. 
If 
Group 
was 
a 
Delaware 
corporation, 
any 
business 
combination 
with 
an 
interested 
shareholder 
 (which, for this purpose, would include mergers 
and asset sales of greater than 
10 of Group s 
assets that would 
 otherwise be considered 
transactions in 
the ordinary course 
of business) within 
a period of three 
years from 
the 
 time the 
person 
became 
an 
interested 
shareholder 
would 
require 
prior 
approval 
from shareholders 
holding 
at 
 least 
66 
2/3 
of 
Group s 
outstanding 
common 
shares 
not 
owned 
by 
the 
interested 
shareholder, 
unless 
the 
 transaction 
qualified 
for 
one 
of 
the 
exemptions 
in 
the 
relevant 
Delaware 
statute 
or 
Group 
opted 
out 
of 
the 
 statute. 
For purposes of the 
Delaware statute, 
an interested 
shareholder is generally defined 
as a person 
who 
 together 
with that 
person s 
affiliates 
and associates 
owns, or 
within the 
previous 
three 
years 
did own, 
15 or 
 more of a corporation s 
outstanding voting shares. 

 Takeovers. 
Under Bermuda law, 
if an acquiror 
makes an 
offer for 
shares of 
a company 
and, within 
four months 
 of the 
offer, 
the holders 
of not less 
than 90 
of the 
shares that 
are the 
subject of 
the offer 
tender their 
shares, 
 the acquiror may 
give the nontendering shareholders 
notice requiring them to 
transfer their shares 
on the terms 
 of the offer. 
Within one month 
of receiving the notice, 
dissenting shareholders 
may apply to the 
court objecting 
 to 
the 
transfer. 
The 
burden 
is 
on 
the 
dissenting 
shareholders 
to 
show 
that 
the 
court 
should 
exercise 
its 
 discretion 
to 
enjoin the 
transfer. 
The court 
will be 
unlikely 
to 
do this 
unless there 
is evidence 
of fraud 
or bad 
 faith 
or 
collusion 
between 
the 
acquiror 
and 
the 
tendering 
shareholders 
aimed 
at 
unfairly 
forcing 
out 
minority 
 shareholders. 
Under 
another 
provision 
of 
Bermuda 
law, 
the 
holders 
of 
95 
of 
the 
shares 
of 
a 
company 
(the 
 acquiring 
shareholders 
may 
give notice 
to the 
remaining 
shareholders 
requiring them 
to sell 
their shares 
on 
 the terms described 
in the notice. 
Within one month 
of receiving the 
notice, dissenting 
shareholders may 
apply 
 to 
the 
court 
for 
an 
appraisal 
of 
their 
shares. 
Within 
one 
month 
of 
the 
court s 
appraisal, 
the 
acquiring 
 shareholders are 
entitled either to 
acquire all shares 
involved at 
the price fixed 
by the court 
or cancel the notice 
 given 
to 
the 
remaining 
shareholders. 
If 
shares 
were 
acquired 
under 
the 
notice 
at 
a 
price 
below 
the 
court s 
 appraisal price, the acquiring shareholders 
must either pay the difference 
in price or cancel the notice and return 
 the 
shares 
thus 
acquired 
to 
the 
shareholder, 
who 
must 
then 
refund 
the 
purchase 
price. 
There 
are 
no 
 comparable provisions under Delaware 
law. 
 Inspection of Corporate 
Records. 
Members of the 
general public 
have the right 
to inspect the public 
documents 
 of Group 
available 
at 
the office 
of the 
Registrar 
of Companies 
and Group s 
registered 
office, both 
in Bermuda. 

 These 
documents 
include 
the 
memorandum 
of 
association, 
which 
describes 
Group s 
permitted 
purposes 
and 
 powers, 
any 
amendments 
to 
the 
memorandum 
of 
association 
and 
documents 
relating 
to 
any 
increase 
or 
 reduction in Group s 
authorized share capital. Shareholders 
of Group have the additional right 
to inspect Group s 
 bye-laws, minutes 
of general meetings 
of shareholders 
and audited financial 
statements that 
must be presented 
 to the annual 
general meeting 
of shareholders. 
The register 
of shareholders 
of Group 
also is open 
to inspection 
 by shareholders and to members 
of the public without charge. 
Group is required to maintain 
its share register at 
 its registered 
office in Bermuda. 
Group also maintains 
a branch register 
in the offices 
of its transfer 
agent in the 
 U.S., which 
is open 
for public 
inspection as 
required under 
the Companies 
Act. 
Group is 
required to 
keep at 
its 
 registered 
office 
a 
register 
of 
its 
directors 
and 
officers 
that 
is 
open 
for 
inspection 
by 
members 
of 
the 
public 
 without charge. 
However, 
Bermuda law 
does not 
provide 
a general 
right for 
shareholders 
to inspect 
or obtain 
 copies of 
any other 
corporate 
records. 
Under Delaware 
law, 
any shareholder 
may inspect 
or obtain 
copies of 
a 
 corporation s 
shareholder 
list 
and 
its 
other 
books 
and 
records 
for 
any 
purpose 
reasonably 
related 
to 
that 
 person s 
interest as a shareholder. 
 Shareholder s 
Suits. 
The 
rights 
of 
shareholders 
under 
Bermuda 
law 
are 
not 
as 
extensive 
as 
the 
rights 
of 
 shareholders 
under 
legislation 
or 
judicial 
precedent 
in 
many 
U.S. 
jurisdictions. 
Class 
actions 
and 
derivative 
 actions 
are 
generally 
not available 
to 
shareholders 
under the 
laws 
of Bermuda. 
However, 
the Bermuda 
courts 
 ordinarily would be expected to 
follow English case law precedent, 
which would permit a shareholder to bring 
an 
 action 
in 
the 
name 
of 
Group 
to 
remedy 
a 
wrong 
done 
to 
Group 
where 
the 
act 
complained 
of is 
alleged 
to 
be 

35 
 beyond 
the 
corporate 
power 
of 
Group 
or 
illegal 
or 
would 
result 
in 
the 
violation 
of 
Group s 
memorandum 
of 
 association or bye-laws. 
Furthermore, the court would 
give consideration 
to acts that are 
alleged to constitute 
a 
 fraud against the minority shareholders 
or where an act requires the approval 
of a greater percentage of Group s 
 shareholders 
than actually 
approved 
it. 
The winning 
party in 
an action 
of this 
type generally 
would 
be able 
to 
 recover 
a 
portion 
of attorneys 
fees 
incurred 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
action. 
Under 
Delaware 
law, 
class 
actions 
 and derivative 
actions generally 
are available 
to stockholders 
for breach 
of fiduciary 
duty, 
corporate 
waste 
and 
 actions not taken 
in accordance with applicable 
law. 
In these types of actions, 
the court has discretion 
to permit 
 the winning party to recover its attorneys 
fees. 

 Limitation of 
Liability of Directors 
and Officers. 
Group s 
bye-laws provide 
that Group and 
its shareholders 
waive 
 all 
claims 
or 
rights 
of 
action 
that 
they 
might 
have, 
individually 
or 
in 
the 
right 
of 
the 
Company, 
against 
any 
 director or 
officer for any 
act or failure 
to act in 
the performance of 
that director s 
or officer s duties. 
However, 
 this waiver 
does not 
apply 
to 
claims or 
rights 
of action 
that 
arise out 
of fraud 
or dishonesty. 
This waiver 
may 
 have 
the 
effect 
of barring 
claims 
arising 
under U.S. 
federal 
securities 
laws. 
Under 
Delaware 
law, 
a 
corporation 
 may 
include 
in 
its 
certificate 
of 
incorporation 
provisions 
limiting 
the 
personal 
liability 
of 
its 
directors 
to 
the 
 corporation 
or 
its 
stockholders 
for 
monetary 
damages 
for 
many 
types 
of 
breach 
of 
fiduciary 
duty. 
However, 
 these provisions may 
not limit liability for any 
breach of the duty of loyalty, 
acts or omissions not in good 
faith or 
 that involve 
intentional misconduct 
or a knowing 
violation of law, 
the authorization 
of unlawful dividends, 
stock 
 repurchases 
or 
stock 
redemptions, 
or 
any 
transaction 
from 
which 
a 
director 
derived 
an 
improper 
personal 
 benefit. 
Moreover, 
Delaware 
provisions 
would 
not 
be likely 
to 
bar 
claims 
arising 
under 
U.S. 
federal 
securities 
 laws. 
 Indemnification 
of Directors 
and Officers. 
Group s 
bye-laws 
provide 
that Group 
shall indemnify 
its directors 
or 
 officers to 
the full extent 
permitted by 
law against 
all actions, 
costs, charges, 
liabilities, loss, damage 
or expense 
 incurred 
or 
suffered 
by 
them 
by 
reason 
of 
any 
act 
done, 
concurred 
in 
or 
omitted 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
Group s 
 business 
or 
in 
the 
discharge 
of 
their 
duties. 
Under 
Bermuda 
law, 
this 
indemnification 
may 
not 
extend 
to 
any 
 matter 
involving 
fraud 
or dishonesty 
of which 
a director 
or officer 
may be 
guilty in 
relation to 
the company, 
as 
 determined 
in 
a 
final 
judgment 
or 
decree 
not 
subject 
to 
appeal. 
Under 
Delaware 
law, 
a 
corporation 
may 
 indemnify a director 
or officer who 
becomes a party 
to an action, 
suit or proceeding 
because of his 
position as a 
 director or officer if (1) the director or officer 
acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably 
believed to be in 
 or 
not 
opposed 
to 
the 
best 
interests 
of the 
corporation 
and (2) 
if the 
action 
or 
proceeding 
involves 
a criminal 
 offense, the director or officer had 
no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct 
was unlawful. 
 Enforcement of Civil 
Liabilities. 
Group is organized 
under the laws of Bermuda. 
Some of its directors 
and officers 
 may reside outside 
the U.S. 
A substantial portion 
of our assets are 
or may be 
located in jurisdictions 
outside the 
 U.S. 
As a result, a 
person may not 
be able to affect 
service of process within 
the U.S. on directors 
and officers of 
 Group and 
those experts 
who reside outside 
the U.S. 
A person 
also may 
not be able 
to recover 
against them 
or 
 Group 
on 
judgments 
of 
U.S. 
courts 
or 
to 
obtain 
original 
judgments 
against 
them or 
Group 
in 
Bermuda 
courts, 
 including judgments predicated upon 
civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal 
securities laws. 
 Dividends. 
Bermuda law 
does not 
allow a 
company 
to declare 
or pay 
a dividend, 
or make 
a distribution 
out of 
 contributed surplus, 
if there are 
reasonable grounds 
for believing that 
the company, 
after the payment 
is made, 
 would 
be unable 
to 
pay 
its liabilities 
as they 
become due, 
or that 
the realizable 
value 
of the 
company s 
assets 
 would 
be 
less, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
payment, 
than 
the 
aggregate 
of 
its 
liabilities 
and 
its 
issued 
share 
capital 
and 
 share premium accounts. 
The share capital account represents 
the aggregate par value 
of issued shares, and the 
 share premium 
account represents 
the aggregate 
amount paid 
for issued shares 
over and above 
their par value. 

 Under Delaware law, 
subject to any restrictions 
contained in a company s 
certificate of incorporation, 
a company 
 may pay 
dividends out 
of the 
surplus or, 
if there 
is no 
surplus, out 
of net 
profits for 
the fiscal 
year in 
which the 
 dividend 
is 
declared 
and/or 
the 
preceding 
fiscal 
year. 
Surplus 
is 
the 
amount 
by 
which 
the 
net 
assets 
of 
a 
 corporation 
exceed 
its 
stated 
capital. 
Delaware 
law 
also 
provides 
that 
dividends 
may 
not 
be 
paid 
out 
of 
net 
 profits at any 
time when stated 
capital is less 
than the capital represented 
by the outstanding 
stock of all 
classes 
 having a preference upon 
the distribution of assets. 

36 
 RISKS RELATING TO 
TAXATION 
 If international tax laws change, our net income 
may be impacted. 
 The 
Organization 
for 
Economic 
Co-operation 
and 
Development OECD 
and 
its 
member 
countries 
which 
 includes the 
U.S., have 
been focusing 
for an 
extended 
period on 
issues related 
to the 
taxation 
of multinational 
 corporations, 
such as the 
comprehensive plan 
set forth 
by the OECD to 
create an 
agreed set 
of international 
tax 
 rules 
for 
preventing 
base 
erosion 
and 
profit 
shifting. 
Recently 
they 
agreed 
upon 
a 
broad 
framework 
for 
 overhauling 
the 
taxation 
of 
multinational 
corporations 
that 
includes, 
among 
other 
things, 
profit 
reallocation 
 rules 
and 
a 
15 
global 
minimum 
corporate 
income 
tax 
rate. 
These 
proposals, 
if 
implemented, 
could 
have 
an 
 impact 
our 
net 
income 
and 
effective 
tax 
rate. 
Group 
and/or 
various 
Group 
companies 
may 
be 
subject 
to 
 additional income taxes, which 
would reduce our net income. 
 If U.S. tax law changes, our net income 
may be impacted. 
 The 
2017 
TCJA 
addressed 
what 
some 
members 
of 
Congress 
had 
expressed 
concern 
about 
for 
several 
years, 
 which was 
U.S. corporations 
moving their 
place of 
incorporation 
to low-tax 
jurisdictions to 
obtain a 
competitive 
 advantage 
over 
domestic 
corporations 
that 
are 
subject 
to 
the 
U.S. 
corporate 
income 
tax 
rate 
of 
21 . 

 Specifically, 
it addressed 
their concern 
over a 
perceived 
competitive 
advantage 
that foreign 
-controlled 
insurers 
 and 
reinsurers 
may 
have 
had 
over 
U.S. 
controlled 
insurers 
and 
reinsurers 
resulting 
from 
the 
purchase 
of 
 reinsurance 
by 
U.S. 
insurers 
from 
affiliates 
operating 
in 
some 
foreign 
jurisdictions, 
including 
Bermuda. 
Such 
 affiliated reinsurance 
transactions 
may subject 
the U.S. 
ceding companies 
to a 
Base Erosion 
and Anti-abuse 
Tax 
 BEAT 
of 10 from 
2019 to 
2025 and 12.5 
thereafter which 
may exceed 
its regular 
income tax. 
In addition, 
 new legislation as 
well as proposed 
and final regulations 
may further limit 
the ability of the 
Company to 
execute 
 alternative 
capital balancing 
transactions 
with unrelated 
parties. This 
would further 
impact our 
net income 
and 
 effective tax rate. 

 On 
August 
16, 
2022, 
the 
Inflation 
Reduction 
Act 
of 
2022 IRA 
was 
enacted. 
We 
have 
evaluated 
the 
tax 
 provisions 
of 
the 
IRA, 
the 
most 
significant 
of 
which 
are 
the 
corporate 
alternative 
minimum 
tax 
and 
the 
share 
 repurchase excise tax 
and do not expect the legislation to have 
a material impact on our results of operations. 
As 
 the IRS issues additional guidance, we will evaluate 
any impact to our consolidated 
financial statements. 
 Group and/or Bermuda Re may be subject to 
U.S. corporate income tax, which 
would reduce our net income. 
 Bermuda Re.

The income 
of Bermuda Re 
is a significant 
portion of our 
worldwide income 
from operations. 
We 
 have 
established 
guidelines 
for 
the 
conduct 
of our 
operations 
that 
are 
designed 
to 
ensure 
that 
Bermuda 
Re 
is 
 not engaged in 
the conduct of 
a trade or 
business in the 
U.S. 
Based on its 
compliance with 
those guidelines, we 
 believe that Bermuda Re 
should not be required 
to pay U.S. corporate 
income tax, other 
than withholding tax 
on 
 U.S. source 
dividend income. 
However, 
if the IRS 
were to 
successfully assert 
that Bermuda Re 
was engaged 
in a 
 U.S. trade 
or business, 
Bermuda Re would 
be required 
to pay 
U.S. corporate

tax. 
However, 
if 
the 
IRS 
were 
to 
successfully 
assert 
that 
Bermuda 
Re 
was 
 engaged in 
a U.S. 
trade or 
business, we believe 
the U.S.-Bermuda 
tax treaty 
would preclude 
the IRS 
from taxing 
 Bermuda Re s 
income except 
to the 
extent 
that its 
income was 
attributable 
to a 
U.S. permanent 
establishment 
 maintained by that 
subsidiary. 
We do not believe that 
Bermuda Re has a permanent 
establishment in the U.S. 
If 
 the IRS were 
to successfully 
assert that 
Bermuda Re did 
have income attributable 
to a permanent 
establishment 
 in the U.S., Bermuda Re would be subject to 
U.S. tax only on that income. 
This would reduce our net income. 

 Group. 
 We 
conduct 
our 
operations 
in 
a 
manner 
designed 
to 
minimize 
our 
U.S. 
tax 
exposures. 

Based 
on 
our 
 compliance with guidelines designed 
to ensure that we 
generate only 
immaterial amounts, if 
any, 
of income that 
 is 
subject 
to 
the 
taxing 
jurisdiction 
of 
the 
U.S., 
we 
believe 
that 
we 
should 
be 
required 
to 
pay 
only 
immaterial 
 amounts, 
if 
any, 
of 
U.S. 
corporate 
income 
tax, 
other 
than 
withholding 
tax 
on 
U.S. 
source 
dividend 
income. 

 However, 
if the IRS 
successfully asserted 
that we had 
material amounts 
of income that 
was subject to 
the taxing 

37 
 jurisdiction of the 
U.S., we would 
be required to 
pay U.S. corporate 
income tax on 
that income, and 
possibly the 
 U.S. branch profits 
tax. 
The imposition of such tax 
would reduce our net income. 
If Bermuda Re became 
subject 
 to U.S. income tax 
on its income, or if we became 
subject to U.S. income tax, 
our income could also be subject 
to 
 the 
U.S. 
branch 
profits 
tax. 
In 
that 
event, 
Group 
and 
Bermuda 
Re 
would 
be 
subject 
to 
taxation 
at 
a 
higher 
 combined effective 
rate 
than if 
they were 
organized 
as U.S. 
corporations. 
The combined 
effect of 
the 21 
U.S. 
 corporate income tax 
rate and the 
30 branch profits tax 
rate is a net tax 
rate of 44.7 . 
The imposition of these 
 taxes would reduce our net 
income. 

 Group and/or Bermuda Re may become 
subject to Bermuda tax, which would reduce our net 
income.

does 
 not prevent the application

the 
Company 
is 
involved 
in 
lawsuits, 
arbitrations 
and 
other 
formal

since 
the 
fourth 
quarter 
of 
1995. 
The 
Company 
 declared 
and

 All comparisons in this discussion are to the corresponding 
prior year unless otherwise indicated. 

 Industry Conditions. 
 The worldwide 
reinsurance 
and insurance 
businesses 
are highly 
competitive, 
as well 
as cyclical 
by 
product 
and 
 market. 
As 
such, 
financial 
results 
tend 
to 
fluctuate 
with 
periods 
of 
constrained 
availability, 
higher 
rates 
and 
 stronger 
profits 
followed 
by 
periods 
of 
abundant 
capacity, 
lower 
rates 
and 
constrained 
profitability. 

 Competition 
in 
the 
types 
of reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
business 
that 
we 
underwrite 
is 
based 
on 
many 
factors, 
 including the perceived overall 
financial strength of 
the reinsurer or insurer, 
ratings of the reinsurer 
or insurer by 
 A.M. Best 
and/or 
Standard 
 Poor s, 
underwriting expertise, 
the jurisdictions 
where the 
reinsurer 
or insurer 
is 
 licensed 
or 
otherwise 
authorized, 
capacity 
and 
coverages 
offered, 
premiums 
charged, 
other 
terms 
and 
 conditions 
of 
the 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
business 
offered, 
services 
offered, 
speed 
of 
claims 
payment 
and 
 reputation 
and 
experience 
in 
lines 
written. 
Furthermore, 
the 
market 
impact 
from 
these 
competitive 
factors 
 related 
to 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
is 
generally 
not 
consistent 
across 
lines 
of 
business, 
domestic 
and 
 international geographical 
areas and distribution channels. 

 We 
compete 
in 
the 
U.S., 
Bermuda 
and 
international 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
markets 
with 
numerous 
global 
 competitors. 
Our 
competitors 
include 
independent 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
companies, 
subsidiaries 
or 
 affiliates 
of 
established 
worldwide 
insurance 
companies, 
reinsurance 
departments 
of 
certain 
insurance 
 companies, domestic 
and international 
underwriting operations, 
including underwriting 
syndicates 
at Lloyd s 
of 
 London 
and 
certain 
government 
sponsored 
risk 
transfer 
vehicles. 
Some 
of 
these 
competitors 
have 
greater 
 financial resources 
than we do 
and have 
established long 
term and continuing 
business relationships, 
which can 
 be 
a 
significant 
competitive 
advantage. 
In 
addition, 
the 
lack 
of 
strong 
barriers 
to 
entry 
into 
the 
reinsurance 
 business 
and 
recently, 
the 
securitization 
of 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
risks 
through 
capital 
markets 
provide 
 additional sources of potential reinsurance 
and insurance capacity and competition. 

 Worldwide insurance 
and reinsurance 
market conditions 
historically have 
been competitive. 
Generally, 
there is 
 ample 
insurance 
and 
reinsurance 
capacity 
relative 
to 
demand, 
as 
well 
as 
additional 
capital 
from 
the 
capital 
 markets 
through 
insurance 
linked 
financial 
instruments. 
These 
financial 
instruments 
such 
as 
side 
cars, 
 catastrophe 
bonds and 
collateralized 
reinsurance 
funds, provided 
capital 
markets 
with access 
to insurance 
and 
 reinsurance 
risk exposure. 
The capital 
markets 
demand for 
these products 
is 
primarily driven 
by the 
desire to 
 achieve 
greater 
risk 
diversification 
and 
potentially 
higher 
returns 
on 
their 
investments. 
This 
competition 
 generally has a negative impact 
on rates, terms and conditions; 
however, 
the impact varies widely by market 
and 
 coverage. 
Based on recent competitive 
behaviors in the 
insurance and reinsurance 
industry, natural 
catastrophe 
 events 
and 
the 
macroeconomic 
backdrop, 
there 
has 
been 
some 
dislocation 
in 
the 
market 
which 
we 
expect 
to 
 have a positive impact on rates 
and terms and conditions, generally, 
though local market specificities can 
vary. 

 The 
increased 
frequency 
of 
catastrophe 
losses 
experienced 
throughout 
2022 
appears 
to 
be 
pressuring 
the 
 increase 
of 
rates. 
As 
business 
activity 
continues 
to 
regain 
strength 
after 
the 
pandemic 
and 
current 
 macroeconomic uncertainty, 
rates appear to be firming in 
most lines of business, particularly in the casualty 
lines 
 that had 
seen significant 
losses such 
as excess 
casualty and 
directors 
and officers 
liability. 
Other casualty 
lines 
 are 
experiencing 
modest 
rate 
increase, 
while 
some 
lines 
such 
as 
workers 
compensation 
were 
experiencing 
 softer 
market 
conditions. 
It 
is 
too 
early 
to 
tell 
what 
the 
impact 
on 
pricing 
conditions 
will 
be, 
but 
it 
is 
likely 
to 
 change depending on the line of business and geography.

 Our capital position remains 
a source of strength, 
with high quality invested 
assets, significant liquidity 
and a low 
 operating 
expense 
ratio. 
Our 
diversified 
global 
platform 
with 
its 
broad 
mix 
of 
products, 
distribution 
and 
 geography is resilient. 
 The war in the 
Ukraine is ongoing 
and an evolving 
event. 
Economic and legal 
sanctions have been 
levied against 
 Russia, 
specific 
named 
individuals 
and 
entities 
connected 
to 
the 
Russian 
government, 
as 
well 
as 
businesses 
 located 
in 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
and/or 
owned 
by 
Russian 
nationals 
by 
numerous 
countries, 
including 
the 
 United States. 
The significant 
political and 
economic uncertainty 
surrounding the 
war and 
associated sanctions 
 have 
impacted 
economic and 
investment 
markets 
both within 
Russia and 
around 
the world. 
The Company 
has 
 recorded 45 million of losses related 
to the Ukraine/Russia war during 2022.

 Revenues. 

 Premiums. 
Gross 
written 
premiums 
increased 
by 
6.9 
to 
 14.0 
billion 
in 
2022, 
compared 
to 
 13.1 
billion 
in 
 2021, 
reflecting 
a 
 653.4 
million, 
or 
16.4 , 
increase 
in 
our 
insurance 
business 
and 
a 
 248.8 
million, 
or 
2.7 , 
 increase 
in our 
reinsurance 
business. 
The increase 
in insurance 
premiums 
reflects 
growth 
across 
most lines 
of 
 business, 
particularly 
specialty 
casualty 
business 
and 
property/short 
tail 
business, 
driven 
by 
positive 
rate 
and 
 exposure 
increases, 
new 
business 
and 
strong 
renewal 
retention. 
The 
increase 
in 
reinsurance 
premiums 
was 
 primarily due to increases in casualty pro 
rata business and financial lines of business, partially offset 
by a decline 
 in 
property 
pro 
rata 
business. 
Net 
written 
premiums 
increased 
by 
7.9 to 
 12.3 billion 
in 
2022, compared 
to 
 11.4 
billion 
in 
2021. 
The 
higher 
percentage 
increase 
in 
net 
written 
premiums 
compared 
to 
gross 
written 
 premiums was primarily 
due to a reduction 
in business ceded to 
the segregated 
accounts of Mt. Logan 
Re during 
 2022 
compared 
to 
2021. 
Premiums 
earned 
increased 
by 
13.3 
to 
 11.8 
billion 
in 
2022, 
compared 
to 
 10.4 
 billion 
in 
2021. 
The 
change 
in 
premiums 
earned 
relative 
to 
net 
written 
premiums 
was 
primarily 
the 
result 
of 
 timing; premiums 
are 
earned 
ratably 
over 
the coverage 
period whereas 
written 
premiums 
are 
recorded 
at 
the 
 initiation of 
the coverage 
period. 
Accordingly, 
the significant 
increase in 
gross written 
premiums from 
pro rata 
 business 
during 
the 
latter 
half 
of 
2021 
contributed 
to 
the 
current 
year-to-date 
percentage 
increases 
in 
net 
 earned premiums. 

 Other Income 
(Expense). 
We 
recorded 
other expense 
of 102 
million and 
other income 
of 37 
million in 
2022 
 and 2021, respectively. 
The changes were primarily 
the result of fluctuations 
in foreign currency exchange 
rates. 

 We 
recognized 
foreign 
currency 
exchange 
expense 
of 
 103 
million 
in 
2022 
and 
foreign 
currency 
exchange 
 income of 28 million in 2021.

 Incurred losses and LAE 
increased by 9.6 to 
 8.1 billion in 2022, compared 
to 7.4 billion in 2021, 
primarily due 
 to 
an 
increase 
of 782 
million 
in 
current 
year 
attritional 
losses, 
partially 
offset 
by 
a 
decrease 
of 80 
million 
in 
 current year 
catastrophe 
losses. 
The increase 
in current 
year attritional 
losses was 
mainly due 
to the 
impact of 
 the 
increase 
in 
premiums 
earned 
and 
 45 million 
of attritional 
losses 
incurred 
due 
to 
the 
Ukraine/Russia 
war. 

 The current 
year catastrophe 
losses of 
 1.1 billion 
in 2022 
related primarily 
to Hurricane 
Ian 699 
million), the 
 2022 
Australia 
floods 88 
million), 
the 
2022 
Western 
Europe 
hailstorms 69 
million), 
the 
2022 
South 
Africa 
 flood 50 
million), the 
2022 Western 
Europe Convective 
Storm 35 
million), Hurricane 
Fiona 27 
million), the 
 2022 
European 
storms 21 
million) 
and 
the 
2022 
Canada 
derecho 21 
million), 
with 
the 
remaining 
losses 
 resulting from various 
storm events. 
The 1.1 billion of current 
year catastrophe 
losses in 2021 related 
primarily 
 to Hurricane 
Ida 460 
million), the 
Texas 
winter storms 294 million), 
the European 
floods 242 
million), the 
 Canada 
drought 
loss 80 
million) 
and 
the 
Quad 
State 
tornadoes 45 
million) 
with 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
losses 
 emanating from the South Africa riots and 
the 2021 Australia floods. 

 Catastrophe 
losses and loss 
expenses typically 
have a 
material effect 
on our incurred 
losses and loss 
adjustment 
 expense results 
and can 
vary significantly 
from period 
to period. 
Losses from 
natural 
catastrophes 
contributed 
 9.0 
percentage 
points 
to 
the 
combined 
ratio 
in 
2022, 
compared 
with 
10.9 
percentage 
points 
in 
2021. 
The 
 Company has 
up to 
 350.0 million 
of catastrophe 
bond protection CAT 
Bond that 
attaches 
at a 
 48.1 billion 
 PCS 
Industry 
loss 
threshold. 
This 
recovery 
would 
be 
recognized 
on 
a 
pro-rata 
basis 
up 
to 
a 
 63.8 
billion 
PCS 
 Industry loss level. 
PCS s current 
industry estimate of 47.4 million 
is below the attachment point. 
The potential 
 recovery 
under 
the 
CAT 
Bond 
is 
not 
included 
in 
the 
Company s 
estimate 
for 
Hurricane 
Ian 
but 
would 
provide 
 significant downside protection should 
the industry loss estimate increase. 

46 
 Commission, 
Brokerage, 
Taxes 
and 
Fees. 
Commission, 
brokerage, 
taxes 
and 
fees 
increased 
by 
14.5 
to 
 2.5 
 billion for 
the year 
ended December 
31, 2022 
compared 
to 2.2 
billion for 
the year 
ended December 
31, 2021. 

 The 
increase 
was 
primarily 
due 
to 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
increases 
in 
premiums 
earned 
and 
changes 
in 
the 
mix 
of 
 business. 

 Other 
Underwriting 
Expenses. 
Other 
underwriting 
expenses 
were 
 682 
million 
and 
 583 
million 
in 
2022 
and 
 2021, respectively. 
The increase in 
other underwriting expenses 
was mainly due to 
the impact of the 
increase in 
 premiums earned 
as well 
as the 
continued build 
out of 
our insurance 
operations, 
including an 
expansion of 
the 
 international insurance platform. 

 Corporate 
Expenses. 
Corporate 
expenses, 
which 
are 
general 
operating 
expenses 
that 
are 
not 
allocated 
to 
 segments, were 61 
million and 68 million 
for the years 
ended December 31, 2022 
and 2021, respectively. 
The 
 decrease from 2021 to 2022 was mainly 
due to a decrease in variable incentive compensation. 

 Interest, 
Fees and 
Bond Issue 
Cost 
Amortization 
Expense. 
Interest, 
fees 
and other 
bond 
amortization 
expense 
 was 
 101 
million 
and 
 70 
million 
in 
2022 
and 
2021, 
respectively. 
The 
increases 
were 
primarily 
due 
to 
the 
 issuance of 1.0 
billion of senior 
notes in October 
2021. 
Interest expense 
was also 
impacted by the 
movements 
 in the 
floating 
interest 
rate 
related 
to 
the long 
term 
subordinated 
notes, 
which is 
reset 
quarterly 
per the 
note 
 agreement. 
The floating rate was 
6.99 as of December 31, 2022 compared to 2.54 as of December 31, 
2021. 

 Income Tax 
Expense (Benefit). 
We had 
income tax 
benefit of 9 
million and income 
tax expense 
of 167 million 
 in 
2022 
and 
2021, 
respectively. 
Income 
tax 
expense 
is 
primarily 
a 
function 
of 
the 
geographic 
location 
of 
the 
 Company s 
pre-tax 
income 
and 
the 
statutory 
tax 
rates 
in 
those 
jurisdictions. 
The 
effective 
tax 
rate ETR 
is 
 primarily 
affected 
by 
tax-exempt 
investment 
income, 
foreign 
tax 
credits 
and 
dividends. 
Variations 
in 
the 
ETR 
 generally result 
from changes 
in the relative 
levels of pre 
-tax income, 
including the impact 
of catastrophe 
losses 
 and net capital gains (losses), among jurisdictions 
with different tax rates. 

 On 
August 
16, 
2022, 
the 
Inflation 
Reduction 
Act 
of 
2022 IRA 
was 
enacted. 
We 
have 
evaluated 
the 
tax 
 provisions 
of 
the 
IRA, 
the 
most 
significant 
of 
which 
are 
the 
corporate 
alternative 
minimum 
tax 
and 
the 
share 
 repurchase excise tax 
and do not expect the legislation to have 
a material impact on our results of operations. 
As 
 the IRS issues additional guidance, we will evaluate 
any impact to our consolidated 
financial statements. 

 Net Income (Loss). 
 Our 
net 
income 
was 
 597 
million 
and 
 1.4 
billion 
in 
2022 
and 
2021, 
respectively. 
The 
change 
was 
primarily 
 driven by the consolidated investment 
results explained below. 

 Ratios. 
 Our 
combined 
ratio 
decreased 
by 
1.8 
points 
to 
96.0 
in 
2022, 
compared 
to 
97.8 
in 
2021. 
The 
loss 
ratio 
 component decreased by 
2.3 points in 2022 over 
the same period last year 
mainly due to a decline 80 million 
in 
 catastrophe 
losses. 
The 
commission 
and 
brokerage 
ratio 
components 
increased 
slightly 
to 
21.4 
in 
2022 
 compared 
to 
21.2 
in 
2021. 
The 
increase 
was 
mainly 
due 
to 
changes 
in 
the 
mix 
of 
business. 
The 
other 
 underwriting expense ratios 
increased slightly 
to 5.8 in 
2022 compared 
to 5.6 in 
2021. 
These increases 
were 
 mainly due to higher insurance operations 
costs. 

 Shareholders Equity. 
 Shareholders 
equity 
decreased 
by 
 1.7 
billion 
to 
 8.4 
billion 
at 
December 
31, 
2022 
from 
 10.1 
billion 
at 
 December 
31, 
2021, 
principally 
as 
a 
result 
of 1.9 
billion 
of unrealized 
depreciation 
on 
available 
for 
sale 
fixed 
 maturity 
portfolio 
net 
of 
tax, 
 255 
million 
of 
shareholder 
dividends, 
 77 
million 
of 
net 
foreign 
currency 
 translation adjustments, 
and the repurchase 
of 241,273 common 
shares for 
 61 million, 
partially offset 
by 597 
 million of net income. 

47 
 Consolidated Investment 
Results 
 Net Investment Income. 
 Net 
investment 
income 
decreased 
by 
28.8 to 
 830 million 
in 2022 
compared 
with 
net 
investment 
income 
of 
 1.2 
billion 
in 
2021. 
The 
decrease 
was 
primarily 
the 
result 
of 
a 
decline 
of 
 490 
million 
in 
limited 
partnership 
 income, 
partially 
offset 
by 
an 
additional 
 181 
million 
of 
income 
from 
fixed 
maturity 
investments. 
The 
limited 
 partnership 
income 
primarily 
reflects 
decreases 
in 
their 
reported

portfolios 
have 
different 
compositions 
than

Our 
fixed

a shorter duration 
because we align our investment 
portfolio with our liabilities. 
We also 
 hold 
foreign

our 
foreign 
liabilities 
while 
the

 Segment Results. 
 The 
Company 
manages 
its 
reinsurance 
and 
insurance 
operations 
as 
autonomous 
units 
and 
key 
strategic 
 decisions are based on the aggregate operating 
results and projections for 
these segments of business. 

 The Reinsurance 
operation 
writes worldwide 
property 
and casualty 
reinsurance 
and specialty 
lines of 
business, 
 on both 
a treaty 
and facultative 
basis, 
through 
reinsurance 
brokers, 
as well 
as directly 
with ceding 
companies. 

 Business is 
written in 
the U.S., 
Bermuda, and 
Ireland offices, 
as well as, 
through branches 
in Canada, 
Singapore, 
 the United 
Kingdom 
and Switzerland. 
The Insurance 
operation 
writes property 
and casualty 
insurance 
directly 

49 
 and 
through 
brokers, 
surplus 
lines 
brokers 
and 
general 
agents 
within 
the 
U.S., 
Bermuda, 
Canada, 
Europe, 
 Singapore 
and 
South 
America 
through 
its 
offices 
in 
the 
U.S., 
Canada, 
Chile, 
Singapore, 
the 
United 
Kingdom, 
 Ireland and branches located 
in the Netherlands, France, Germany and Spain. 

 These segments are 
managed independently, 
but conform 
with corporate 
guidelines with respect 
to pricing, risk 
 management, 
control 
of 
aggregate 
catastrophe 
exposures, 
capital, 
investments 
and 
support 
operations. 

 Management 
generally 
monitors 
and 
evaluates 
the 
financial 
performance 
of 
these 
operating 
segments 
based 
 upon their underwriting results. 

 Underwriting results 
include earned 
premium less 
LAE incurred, 
commission and 
brokerage 
expenses and 
other 
 underwriting 
expenses. 
We 
measure 
our 
underwriting 
results 
using 
ratios, 
in 
particular 
loss, 
commission 
and 
 brokerage 
and other 
underwriting expense 
ratios, 
which, respectively, 
divide 
incurred 
losses, 
commissions 
and 
 brokerage and other 
underwriting expenses by premiums earned. 

 The 
Company 
does 
not 
maintain 
separate 
balance 
sheet 
data 
for 
its 
operating 
segments. 
Accordingly, 
the 
 Company does not 
review and evaluate 
the financial results 
of its operating 
segments based upon 
balance sheet 
 data. 

 Our 
loss 
and LAE 
reserves 
are 
management s 
best 
estimate 
of our 
ultimate 
liability 
for 
unpaid 
claims. 
We 
re-
 evaluate 
our 
estimates 
on 
an 
ongoing 
basis, 
including 
all 
prior 
period 
reserves, 
taking 
into 
consideration 
all 
 available 
information, 
and 
in 
particular, 
recently 
reported 
loss 
claim 
experience 
and 
trends 
related 
to 
prior 
 periods. 
Such re-evaluations are recorded 
in incurred losses in the period in which re-evaluation 
is made.

 Premiums. 
Gross written 
premiums increased by 
2.7 to 9.3 billion 
in 2022 from 9.1 
billion in 2021, primarily 
 due 
to 
increases 
in 
casualty 
pro 
rata 
business 
and 
financial 
lines 
of 
business, 
partially 
offset 
by 
a 
decline 
in 
 property 
pro rata 
business. 
Net written 
premiums 
increased 
by 5.2 
to 
 9.0 billion 
in 2022 
compared 
to 
 8.5 
 billion in 
2021. 
The higher 
percentage 
increase 
in net 
written 
premiums 
compared 
to gross 
written 
premiums 

50 
 mainly related to 
a reduction in business ceded 
to the segregated 
accounts of Mt. Logan 
Re in 2022 compared 
to 
 2021. 
Premiums 
earned 
increased 
by 
11.7 
to 
 8.7 
billion 
in 
2022, 
compared 
to 
 7.8 
billion 
in 
2021. 
The 
 change 
in 
premiums 
earned 
relative 
to 
net 
written 
premiums 
is 
primarily 
the 
result 
of 
timing; 
premiums 
are 
 earned 
ratably 
over 
the 
coverage 
period 
whereas 
written 
premiums 
are 
recorded 
at 
the 
initiation 
of 
the 
 coverage period. 
Accordingly, 
the significant 
increases in 
gross written 
premiums from 
pro rata 
business during 
 the latter half of 2021 contributed 
to the current year-to-date percentage 
increase in net earned premiums.

 Incurred 
losses 
increased 
by 
7.9 
to 
 6.0 
billion 
in 
2022, compared 
to 
 5.6 
billion 
in 
2021. 
The 
increase 
was 
 primarily due to an increase 
of 488 million in current 
year attritional losses, 
partially offset by a decrease 
of 53 
 million in 
current 
year catastrophe 
losses. 
The increase 
in current 
year attritional 
losses was 
mainly related 
to 
 the 
impact 
of the 
increase 
in 
premiums 
earned 
and 
 45 million 
of attritional 
losses 
due to 
the 
Ukraine/Russia 
 war. 
The 
current 
year 
catastrophe 
losses 
of 
 930 
million 
in 
2022 
related 
primarily 
to 
Hurricane 
Ian 599 
 million), 
the 
2022 
Australia 
floods 88 
million), 
the 
Western 
Europe 
hailstorms 69

the 
2022

flood 50 
million), 
the 
2022

Hurricane

 million), the 2022 European 
storms 21 million) 
and the 2022 Canada 
derecho 21 million), 
with the remaining 
 losses resulting 
from various 
storm events. 
The 983 
million of 
current year 
catastrophe 
losses in 
2021 related 
 primarily 
to 
Hurricane 
Ida 380 
million), 
the 
Texas 
winter 
storms 237 
million), 
the 
European 
floods 242 
 million), the 
Canada drought 
loss 80 
million) and 
the Quad 
state 
tornadoes 30 
million), with 
the rest 
of the 
 losses emanating from the 2021 South Africa riots and 
the 2021 Australia floods. 

 Segment Expenses. 
Commission and 
brokerage 
expense increased 
by 15.1 to 
 2.1 billion in 
2022 compared to 
 1.9 billion in 2021. 
The increase was mainly 
due to the impact of the 
increase in premiums earned 
and changes 

51 
 in 
the 
mix 
of 
business. 
Segment 
other 
underwriting 
expenses 
increased 
to 
 218 
million 
in 
2022 
from 
 199 
 million 
in 
2021. 
The 
increase 
was 
mainly 
due 
to 
the 
increase 
in 
written 
premium 
attributable 
to 
the 
planned 
 expansion of the business.

 Premiums. 
Gross written 
premiums increased 
by 16.4 to 
 4.6 billion in 
2022 compared 
to 4.0 billion 
in 2021. 

 The increase 
in insurance 
premiums reflects 
growth across 
most lines 
of business, 
particularly specialty 
casualty 
 and 
property/short 
tail 
business, 
driven 
by 
positive 
rate 
and 
exposure 
increases, 
new 
business 
and 
strong 
 renewal retention. 
Net written 
premiums increased 
by 15.5 to 
 3.4 billion in 
2022 compared 
to 2.9 billion 
in 
 2021, which 
is consistent 
with the 
percentage 
change 
in gross 
written 
premiums. 
Premiums 
earned increased 
 17.9 to 
 3.1 million 
in 2022 
compared to 
 2.6 billion 
in 2021. 
The change 
in premiums 
earned relative 
to net 
 written premiums is the result 
of timing; premiums are earned ratably 
over the coverage 
period whereas written 
 premiums 
are 
recorded 
at 
the 
initiation 
of the 
coverage 
period. 
Accordingly, 
the significant 
increases 
in gross 
 written premiums 
during the 
latter 
half of 
2021 contributed 
to the 
current year 
-to-date 
percentage 
increase in 
 net earned premiums.

 Incurred losses and LAE increased by 
14.6 to 2.1 billion in 2022 compared to 1.8 billion 
in 2021. 
The increase 
 was mainly 
due to 
an increase 
of 293 
million in 
current year 
attritional 
losses, 
partially offset 
by a 
decrease in 
 current year 
catastrophe 
losses of 
 28 million. 
The increase 
in current 
year attritional 
losses was 
primarily due 
 to the impact 
of the increase 
in premiums earned. 
The current year 
catastrophe 
losses of 125 
million primarily 
 related to 
Hurricane Ian 99 million), 
with the 
remaining losses 
resulting from 
various storm 
events. 
The 153 
 million of current 
year catastrophe 
losses in 2021 related 
to Hurricane Ida 80 million), the Texas 
winter storms 
 58 million) and the Quad State tornadoes 15 million). 

 Segment 
Expenses. 
Commission and 
brokerage 
increased by 
11.3 to 
 394 million 
in 2022 
compared 
to 
 354 
 million 
in 
2021. 
Segment 
other 
underwriting 
expenses 
increased 
to 
 463 
million 
in 
2022 
compared 
to 
 384 
 million 
in 
2021. 
These 
increases 
were 
mainly 
due 
to 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
increase 
in 
premiums 
earned 
and 
 increased expenses 
related 
to the 
continued 
build out 
of the 
insurance 
business, including 
an expansion 
of the 
 international insurance platform. 

 Critical Accounting Estimates 

 The following 
is a 
summary of 
the critical 
accounting estimates 
related to 
accounting estimates 
that (1) 
require 
 management 
to 
make 
assumptions 
about 
highly 
uncertain 
matters 
and 
(2) 
could 
materially 
impact 
the 
 consolidated financial statements 
if management made different 
assumptions. 

 Loss and LAE 
Reserves. 
Our most critical 
accounting estimate 
is the determination 
of our loss 
and LAE reserves. 

 We 
maintain 
reserves 
equal to 
our estimated 
ultimate 
liability for 
losses 
and LAE 
for 
reported 
and unreported 

53 
 claims for our insurance and reinsurance 
businesses. 
Because reserves are based on estimates 
of ultimate losses 
 and 
LAE 
by 
underwriting 
or 
accident 
year, 
we 
use 
a 
variety 
of 
statistical 
and 
actuarial 
techniques 
to 
monitor 
 reserve 
adequacy 
over 
time, evaluate 
new information 
as it 
becomes known 
and adjust 
reserves 
whenever 
an 
 adjustment 
appears 
warranted. 
We 
consider 
many 
factors 
when 
setting 
reserves 
including: 
(1) 
our 
exposure 
 base 
and 
projected 
ultimate 
premiums 
earned; 
(2) 
our 
expected 
loss 
ratios 
by 
product 
and 
class 
of 
business, 
 which are developed collaboratively 
by underwriters and actuaries; 
(3) actuarial methodologies and 
assumptions 
 which analyze 
our loss 
reporting and 
payment experience, 
reports from 
ceding companies 
and historical 
trends, 
 such 
as 
reserving 
patterns, 
loss 
payments 
and 
product 
mix; 
(4) 
current 
legal 
interpretations 
of 
coverage 
and 
 liability; 
and 
(5) 
economic 
conditions. 
Our 
insurance 
and 
reinsurance 
loss 
and 
LAE 
reserves 
represent 
 management s best 
estimate of our ultimate 
liability. Actual 
losses and LAE ultimately 
paid may deviate, 
perhaps 
 substantially, 
from 
such 
reserves. 
Our 
net 
income 
(loss) 
will 
be 
impacted 
in 
a 
period 
in 
which 
the 
change 
in 
 estimated ultimate losses 
and LAE is recorded. 
See also ITEM 8, Financial Statements 
and Supplementary Data 
 - Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. 

 It is more 
difficult to 
accurately 
estimate loss 
reserves for 
reinsurance 
liabilities than 
for insurance 
liabilities. 
At 
 December 31, 
2022, we 
had reinsurance 
reserves of 
 16.1 billion, 
of which 
 278 million 
were loss 
reserves for 
 A E 
liabilities, 
and 
insurance 
loss 
reserves 
of 
 5.9 
billion. 
A 
detailed 
discussion 
of 
additional 
considerations 
 related to A E exposures 
follows later in this section. 

 The 
detailed 
data 
required 
to 
evaluate 
ultimate 
losses 
for 
our 
insurance 
business 
is 
accumulated 
from 
our 
 underwriting and claim systems. 
Reserving for reinsurance 
requires evaluation of loss 
information received 
from 
 ceding companies. 
Ceding companies 
report losses 
to us 
in many 
forms dependent 
on the type 
of contract 
and 
 the 
agreed 
or 
contractual 
reporting 
requirements. 
Generally, 
proportional/quota 
share 
contracts 
require 
the 
 submission 
of 
a 
monthly/quarterly 
account, 
which 
includes 
premium 
and 
loss 
activity 
for 
the 
period 
with 
 corresponding reserves 
as established by 
the ceding company. 
This information 
is recorded into 
our records. 
For 
 certain 
proportional 
contracts, 
we 
may 
require 
a 
detailed 
loss 
report 
for 
claims 
that 
exceed 
a 
certain 
dollar 
 threshold 
or 
relate 
to 
a 
particular 
type 
of 
loss. 
Excess 
of 
loss 
and 
facultative 
contracts 
generally 
require 
 individual loss reporting 
with precautionary notices 
provided when a 
loss reaches a 
significant percentage 
of the 
 attachment point 
of the contract 
or when certain causes 
of loss or types 
of injury occur. 
Our experienced claims 
 staff 
handles 
individual 
loss reports 
and supporting 
claim information. 
Based on 
our evaluation 
of a 
claim, we 
 may establish 
additional case 
reserves (ACRs) 
in addition 
to the 
case reserves 
reported by 
the ceding 
company. 
 To 
ensure 
ceding 
companies 
are 
submitting 
required 
and accurate 
data, 
the 
Underwriting, 
Claim, 
Reinsurance 
 Accounting 
and Internal 
Audit departments 
of the 
Company 
perform various 
reviews 
of our 
ceding companies, 
 particularly larger ceding companies, including 
on-site audits of domestic ceding companies. 

 We sort 
both our 
reinsurance 
and insurance 
reserves into 
exposure 
groupings 
for actuarial 
analysis. 
We assign 
 our 
business 
to 
exposure 
groupings 
so 
that 
the 
underlying 
exposures 
have 
reasonably 
homogeneous 
loss 
 development 
characteristics 
and 
are 
large 
enough 
to 
facilitate 
credible 
estimation 
of 
ultimate 
losses. 
We 
 periodically 
review 
our 
exposure 
groupings 
and 
we 
may 
change 
our 
groupings 
over 
time 
as 
our 
business 
 changes. 
We 
currently 
use 
over 
200 
exposure 
groupings 
to 
develop 
our 
reserve 
estimates. 
One 
of 
the 
key 
 selection characteristics 
for 
the 
exposure 
groupings 
is the 
historical 
duration 
of the 
claims 
settlement 
process. 

 Business in 
which claims 
are reported 
and settled 
relatively quickly 
are commonly 
referred 
to as 
short tail 
lines, 
 principally property 
lines. 
Casualty claims 
tend to 
take 
longer to 
be reported 
and settled 
and casualty 
lines are 
 generally referred 
to as 
long tail 
lines. 
Our estimates 
of ultimate 
losses for 
shorter tail 
lines, with 
the exception 
 of loss estimates for large catastrophic 
events, 
generally exhibit less volatility 
than those for the longer tail lines. 

 We 
use 
similar 
actuarial 
methodologies, 
such 
as 
expected 
loss 
ratio, 
chain 
ladder 
reserving 
methods 
and 
 Bornhuetter-Ferguson, 
supplemented 
by judgment 
where appropriate, 
to estimate 
our ultimate 
losses and 
LAE 
 for each 
exposure group. 
Although we 
use similar 
actuarial methodologies 
for both 
short tail 
and long 
tail lines, 
 the faster reporting 
of experience for 
the short tail lines 
allows us to 
have greater confidence 
in our estimates 
of 
 ultimate 
losses 
for 
short 
tail 
lines 
at 
an 
earlier 
stage 
than 
for 
long 
tail 
lines. 
As 
a 
result, 
we 
utilize, 
as 
well, 
 exposure-based 
methods 
to 
estimate 
our ultimate 
losses 
for 
longer 
tail 
lines, 
especially 
for 
immature 
accident 
 years. 
For 
both 
short 
and 
long 
tail 
lines, 
we 
supplement 
these 
general 
approaches 
with 
analytically 
based 

54 
 judgments. 
We 
cannot 
estimate 
losses 
from 
widespread 
catastrophic 
events, 
such 
as 
hurricanes 
and 
 earthquakes, 
using 
traditional 
actuarial 
methods. 
We 
estimate 
losses 
for 
these 
types 
of 
events 
based 
on 
 information 
derived 
from 
catastrophe 
models, 
quantitative 
and 
qualitative 
exposure 
analyses, 
reports 
and 
 communications 
from 
ceding 
companies 
and 
development 
patterns 
for 
historically 
similar 
events. 
Due 
to 
the 
 inherent 
uncertainty 
in 
estimating 
such 
losses, 
these 
estimates 
are 
subject 
to 
variability, 
which 
increases 
with 
 the severity and complexity of the underlying event. 

 Our key 
actuarial assumptions 
contain 
no explicit 
provisions 
for reserve 
uncertainty 
nor do 
we supplement 
the 
 actuarially determined reserves for uncertainty. 
 Our carried 
reserves at 
each reporting 
date are 
management s 
best estimate 
of ultimate 
unpaid losses 
and LAE 
 at 
that 
date. 
We 
complete 
detailed 
reserve 
studies 
for 
each exposure 
group 
annually 
for our 
reinsurance 
and 
 insurance 
operations. 
The 
completed 
annual 
reinsurance 
reserve 
studies 
are 
 rolled 
forward 
for 
each 
 accounting period 
until the 
subsequent reserve 
study is 
completed. 
Analyzing the 
roll-forward 
process involves 
 comparing 
actual 
reported 
losses 
to 
expected 
losses 
based 
on 
the 
most 
recent 
reserve 
study. 
We 
analyze 
 significant 
variances 
between 
actual 
and 
expected 
losses 
and 
also 
consider 
recent 
market, 
underwriting 
and 
 management 
criteria 
to 
determine 
management s 
best 
estimate 
of 
ultimate 
unpaid 
losses 
and 
LAE. 

 Management s 
best estimate 
is developed 
through 
collaboration 
with actuarial, 
underwriting, claims, 
legal 
and 
 finance 
departments 
and 
culminates 
with 
the 
input 
of 
reserve 
committees. 
Each 
segment 
reserve 
committee 
 includes the participation of the relevant parties 
from actuarial, finance, claims and segment senior management 
 and has 
the responsibility 
for recommending 
and approving 
management s 
best estimate. 
Reserves are 
further 
 reviewed 
by 
Everest s 
Chief 
Reserving 
Actuary 
and 
senior 
management. 
The 
objective 
of 
such 
process 
is 
to 
 determine a single best 
estimate viewed by 
management to be 
the best estimate 
of its ultimate loss 
liability. 
As 
 a result of 
these additional factors, 
in some instances 
the selected reserve 
level may be 
higher or lower than 
the 
 actuarial indicated estimate. 

 Given 
the 
inherent 
variability 
in 
our 
loss 
reserves, 
we 
have 
developed 
an 
estimated 
range 
of 
possible 
gross 
 reserve 
levels. 
A 
table 
of 
ranges 
by 
segment, 
accompanied 
by 
commentary 
on 
potential 
and 
historical 
 variability, 
is 
included 
in 
 Financial 
Condition 
- Loss 
and 
LAE Reserves . 
The ranges 
are 
statistically 
developed 
 using the exposure groups used in 
the reserve estimation process 
and aggregated to the segment 
level. 
For each 
 exposure 
group, 
our actuaries 
calculate 
a range 
for each 
accident year 
based principally 
on two 
variables. 
The 
 first 
is 
the 
historical 
changes 
in 
losses 
and 
LAE incurred 
but not 
reported IBNR 
for 
each 
accident 
year 
over 
 time; the second is 
volatility of each 
accident year s 
held reserves related 
to estimated 
ultimate losses, also 
over 
 time. 
Both are measured at various 
ages from the end of the accident year through 
the final payout of the year s 
 losses. 
Ranges are 
developed for 
the exposure 
groups using 
statistical 
methods to 
adjust for 
diversification; 
the 
 ranges 
for 
the 
exposure 
groups 
are 
aggregated 
to 
the 
segment 
level, 
likewise, 
with 
an 
adjustment 
for 
 diversification. 
Our 
estimates 
of 
our 
reserve 
variability 
may 
not 
be 
comparable 
to 
those 
of 
other 
companies 
 because there 
are no 
consistently 
applied actuarial 
or accounting 
standards 
governing such 
presentations. 
Our 
 recorded 
reserves 
reflect 
our 
best 
point 
estimate 
of 
our 
liabilities 
and 
our 
actuarial 
methodologies 
focus 
on 
 developing 
such 
point 
estimates. 
We 
calculate 
the 
ranges 
subsequently, 
based 
on 
the 
historical 
variability 
of 
 such reserves. 
 Asbestos and Environmental 
Exposures. 
We continue to 
receive claims under expired 
insurance and reinsurance 
 contracts asserting 
injuries and/or damages 
relating to 
or resulting 
from environmental 
pollution and hazardous 
 substances, 
including 
asbestos. 
Environmental 
claims 
typically 
assert 
liability 
for 
(a) 
the 
mitigation 
or 
 remediation 
of environmental 
contamination 
or (b) 
bodily injury 
or property 
damage 
caused 
by 
the release 
of 
 hazardous 
substances 
into the 
land, air 
or water. 
Asbestos claims 
typically assert 
liability for 
bodily injury 
from 
 exposure to asbestos or for 
property damage resulting from asbestos 
or products containing asbestos. 
 Our 
reserves 
include 
an 
estimate 
of 
our 
ultimate 
liability 
for 
A E 
claims. 
There 
are 
significant 
uncertainties 
 surrounding our 
estimates of 
our potential 
losses from 
A E claims. 
Among the 
uncertainties 
are: (a) 
potentially 
 long waiting periods 
between exposure 
and manifestation 
of any 
bodily injury or 
property damage; 
(b) difficulty 
 in 
identifying 
sources 
of 
asbestos 
or 
environmental 
contamination; 
(c) 
difficulty 
in 
properly 
allocating 

55 
 responsibility 
and/or liability 
for asbestos 
or environmental 
damage; (d) 
changes in 
underlying laws 
and judicial 
 interpretation 
of those laws; 
(e) the potential 
for an 
asbestos or 
environmental 
claim to involve 
many insurance 
 providers 
over 
many 
policy 
periods; 
(f) 
questions 
concerning 
interpretation 
and 
application 
of 
insurance 
and 
 reinsurance coverage; 
and (g) uncertainty 
regarding the 
number and identity 
of insureds with 
potential asbestos 
 or environmental exposure. 

 Due to the uncertainties 
discussed above, the ultimate 
losses attributable to 
A E, and particularly asbestos, 
may 
 be subject to more variability 
than are non-A E reserves 
and such variation 
could have a material 
adverse effect 
 on our 
financial condition, 
results of 
operations 
and/or cash 
flows. 
See also 
ITEM 8, 
 Financial Statements 
and 
 Supplementary Data - Notes 1 and 3 
of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

 Reinsurance 
Recoverables. 
We 
have 
purchased 
reinsurance 
to 
reduce 
our 
exposure 
to 
adverse 
claim 
 experience, 
large 
claims 
and catastrophic 
loss 
occurrences. 
Our ceded 
reinsurance 
provides 
for 
recovery 
from 
 reinsurers 
of 
a 
portion 
of 
losses 
and 
loss 
expenses 
under 
certain 
circumstances. 
Such 
reinsurance 
does 
not 
 relieve us of our 
obligation to 
our policyholders. 
In the event our 
reinsurers are 
unable to meet their obligations 
 under these agreements 
or are able to successfully 
challenge losses ceded by 
us under the contracts, 
we will not 
 be 
able 
to 
realize 
the 
full 
value 
of 
the 
reinsurance 
recoverable 
balance. 
In 
some 
cases, 
we 
may 
hold 
full 
or 
 partial collateral 
for the 
receivable, 
including letters 
of credit, 
trust assets 
and cash. 
Additionally, 
creditworthy 
 foreign 
reinsurers 
of 
business 
written 
in 
the 
U.S., 
as 
well 
as 
capital 
markets 
reinsurance 
mechanisms, 
are 
 generally required 
to secure their 
obligations. 
We have 
established reserves 
for uncollectible balances 
based on 
 our 
assessment 
of 
the 
collectability 
of 
the 
outstanding 
balances. 
The 
allowance 
for 
uncollectible 
reinsurance 
 reflects 
management s 
best 
estimate 
of 
reinsurance 
cessions 
that 
may 
be 
uncollectible 
in 
the 
future 
due 
to 
 reinsurers 
unwillingness or 
inability to pay. 
The allowance for 
uncollectible reinsurance 
comprises an 
allowance 
 and 
an 
allowance 
for 
disputed 
balances. 
Based 
on 
this 
analysis, 
the 
Company 
may 
adjust 
the 
allowance 
for 
 uncollectible reinsurance or charge 
off reinsurer balances that are 
determined to be uncollectible. 

 Due to the inherent 
uncertainties as to 
collection and the length 
of time before reinsurance 
recoverable become 
 due, it is possible that future adjustments 
to the Company s reinsurance 
recoverable, net of the 
allowance, could 
 be required, 
which could 
have a 
material adverse 
effect on 
the Company s 
consolidated results 
of operations 
or 
 cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period. 

 The allowance 
is 
estimated 
as 
the 
amount 
of reinsurance 
recoverable 
exposed 
to 
loss multiplied 
by 
estimated 
 factors 
for 
the 
probability 
of 
default. 
The 
reinsurance 
recoverable 
exposed 
is 
the 
amount 
of 
reinsurance 
 recoverable 
net of collateral 
and other offsets, 
considering the nature 
of the collateral, 
potential future 
changes 
 in collateral 
values, and 
historical loss 
information for 
the type of 
collateral obtained. 
The probability 
of default 
 factors are 
historical insurer 
and reinsurer 
defaults for 
liabilities with similar 
durations to 
the reinsured liabilities 
 as 
estimated 
through 
multiple 
economic 
cycles. 
Credit 
ratings 
are 
forward-looking 
and 
consider 
a 
variety 
of 
 economic outcomes. 
The Company's 
evaluation of 
the required allowance 
for reinsurance 
recoverable 
considers 
 the current economic environment 
as well as macroeconomic scenarios. 

 The 
Company 
records 
credit 
loss 
expenses 
related 
to 
reinsurance 
recoverable 
in 
Incurred 
losses 
and 
loss 
 adjustment expenses in the Company s 
consolidated statements 
of operations and comprehensive 
income (loss). 

 Write-offs of 
reinsurance recoverable 
and any related 
allowance are recorded 
in the period in 
which the balance 
 is deemed uncollectible. 

 Premiums 
Written 
and 
Earned. 
Premiums 
written 
by 
us 
are 
earned 
ratably 
over 
the 
coverage 
periods 
of 
the 
 related insurance 
and reinsurance 
contracts. 
We 
establish 
unearned premium 
reserves 
to cover 
the unexpired 
 portion of 
each contract. 
Such reserves, 
for assumed 
reinsurance, 
are computed 
using pro 
rata 
methods based 
 on statistical 
data received from 
ceding companies. 
Premiums earned, and the 
related costs, 
which have not yet 
 been 
reported 
to 
us, 
are 
estimated 
and 
accrued. 
Because 
of 
the 
inherent 
lag 
in 
the 
reporting 
of 
written 
and 
 earned 
premiums 
by 
our 
ceding 
companies, 
we 
use 
standard 
accepted 
actuarial 
methodologies 
to 
estimate 
 earned but not reported 
premium at each financial reporting 
date. These earned but 
not reported premiums 
are 
 combined 
with 
reported 
earned 
premiums 
to 
comprise 
our 
total 
premiums 
earned 
for 
determination 
of 
our 

56 
 incurred 
losses 
and 
loss 
and 
LAE 
reserves. 
Commission 
expense 
and 
incurred 
losses 
related 
to 
the 
change 
in 
 earned 
but 
not 
reported 
premium are 
included 
in 
current 
period 
company 
and segment 
financial 
results.

 Investment 
Valuation. 
Our fixed 
income 
investments 
are 
classified for 
accounting 
purposes 
as either 
available 
 for sale 
or held to 
maturity. 
The available 
for sale 
fixed maturity 
securities are 
carried at fair 
value and 
the held 
 to maturity fixed 
maturity portfolio 
is carried at 
amortized cost, 
net of current 
expected credit 
allowance on our 
 consolidated 
balance 
sheets. 
Our 
equity 
securities 
are 
all 
carried 
at 
fair 
value. 
Most 
securities 
we 
own 
are 
 traded 
on 
national 
exchanges 
where 
market 
values 
are 
readily 
available. 
Some 
of 
our 
commercial 
mortgage-
 backed 
securities CMBS 
are valued 
using cash 
flow models 
and risk-adjusted 
discount rates. 
We hold 
some 
 privately 
placed securities, 
less than 
10 of 
the portfolio, 
that 
are 
either valued 
by investment 
advisors 
or the 
 Company. 
In 
some 
instances, 
values 
provided 
by 
an 
investment 
advisor 
are 
supported 
with 
opinions 
from 
 qualified independent third parties. 
The Company has procedures 
in place to review the values 
received from its 
 investment 
advisors. 
At 
December 31, 
2022 and 
2021, our 
investment 
portfolio 
included 
 3.8 billion 
and 2.6 
 billion, 
respectively, 
of 
limited 
partnership 
investments 
whose 
values 
are 
reported 
pursuant 
to 
the 
equity 
 method 
of 
accounting. 
We 
carry 
these 
investments 
at 
values 
provided 
by 
the 
managements 
of 
the 
limited 
 partnerships and 
due to inherent 
reporting lags, 
the carrying values 
are based on 
values with as 
of dates from 
 one month to one quarter prior to our financial statement 
date. 

 At December 31, 2022, we had 
net unrealized losses on our available 
for sale fixed maturity 
securities, net of tax, 
 of 1.7 billion 
compared to 
net unrealized 
gains on 
our available 
for sale 
fixed maturity 
securities, net 
of tax, 
of 
 239 million 
at December 
31, 2021. 
Gains (losses) 
from market 
fluctuations on 
available for 
sale fixed 
maturity 
 securities 
at 
fair 
value 
are 
reflected 
as 
accumulated 
other 
comprehensive 
income 
(loss) 
in 
the 
consolidated 
 balance sheets. 
Market 
value declines 
for available 
for sale 
fixed income 
portfolio, 
which are 
considered credit 
 related, are reflected 
in our consolidated 
statements of operations 
and comprehensive income 
(loss), as realized 
 capital 
losses. 
We 
consider 
many 
factors 
when 
determining 
whether 
a 
market 
value 
decline 
is 
credit 
related, 
 including: 
(1) we 
have no 
intent 
to sell 
and, more 
likely than 
not, will 
not be 
required to 
sell prior 
to recovery, 
 (2) the 
length of 
time the 
market 
value has 
been below 
book value, 
(3) the 
credit strength 
of the 
issuer, 
(4) the 
 issuer s 
market 
sector, 
(5) 
the 
length 
of 
time 
to 
maturity 
and 
(6) 
for 
asset-backed 
securities, 
changes 
in 
 prepayments, 
credit 
enhancements 
and 
underlying 
default 
rates. 
If management s 
assessments 
change 
in 
the 
 future, we may 
ultimately record 
a realized loss 
after management 
originally concluded that 
the decline in value 
 was temporary. 

 Fixed 
maturity 
securities 
designated 
as 
held 
to 
maturity 
consist 
of 
debt 
securities 
for 
which 
the 
Company 
has 
 both the positive 
intent and ability 
to hold to 
maturity or redemption 
and are reported 
at amortized cost, 
net of 
 the 
current 
expected 
credit 
loss 
allowance. 
Interest 
income 
for 
fixed 
maturity 
securities 
held 
to 
maturity 
is 
 determined in the 
same manner as interest 
income for fixed 
maturity securities available 
for sale. 
The Company 
 evaluates 
fixed 
maturity 
securities 
classified as 
held to 
maturity 
for 
current 
expected 
credit 
losses 
utilizing 
risk 
 characteristics 
of 
each 
security, 
including 
credit 
rating, 
remaining 
time 
to 
maturity, 
adjusted 
for 
prepayment 
 considerations, 
and 
subordination 
level, 
and 
applying 
default 
and 
recovery 
rates, 
which 
include 
the 

57 
 incorporation 
of 
historical 
credit 
loss 
experience 
and 
macroeconomic 
forecasts, 
to 
develop 
an 
estimate 
of 
 current expected credit losses.

 FINANCIAL CONDITION 

 Investments. 
Total 
investments were 
 28.5 billion at 
December 31, 2022, 
an increase 
of 241 million 
compared 
 to 
 28.2 
billion 
at 
December 
31, 
2021. 
The 
rise 
in 
investments 
was 
primarily 
related 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
other 
 invested assets, partially 
offset by a decline in equity 
securities. 
The increase in other invested 
assets was due to 
 the inclusion 
of assets held 
for the implementation 
of a Company 
Owned Life Insurance COLI program 
in the 
 fourth quarter 
of 2022. 
A portion of 
the equity securities 
portfolio was 
sold in order 
to invest 
in the COLI 
assets 
 which accounted for the decline in equity 
securities. 

 The 
Company s 
limited 
partnership 
investments 
are 
comprised 
of 
limited 
partnerships 
that 
invest 
in 
private 
 equity, 
private 
credit 
and 
private 
real 
estate. 
Generally, 
the 
limited 
partnerships 
are 
reported 
on 
a 
month 
or 
 quarter 
lag. 
We 
receive 
annual 
audited 
financial 
statements 
for 
all 
of 
the 
limited 
partnerships 
which 
are 
 prepared using 
fair value accounting 
in accordance with 
FASB guidance. 
For the quarterly 
reports, the Company 
 reviews 
the 
financial 
reports 
for 
any 
unusual 
changes 
in 
carrying 
value. 
If 
the 
Company 
becomes 
aware 
of 
a 
 significant 
decline in 
value during 
the lag 
reporting 
period, the 
loss will 
be recorded 
in the 
period in 
which the 
 Company identifies the decline. 

 The 
table 
below 
summarizes 
the 
composition 
and 
characteristics 
of 
our

 Changes 
in 
premiums 
earned 
and 
business 
mix, 
reserve 
re-estimations, 
catastrophe 
losses 
and 
changes 
in 
 catastrophe loss reserves 
and claim settlement activity all impact loss and LAE 
reserves by segment and in total. 
 Our 
carried 
loss 
and 
LAE 
reserves 
represent 
management s 
best 
estimate 
of 
our 
ultimate 
liability 
for 
unpaid 
 claims. 
We 
continuously 
re-evaluate 
our 
reserves, 
including 
re-estimates 
of 
prior 
period 
reserves, 
taking 
into 
 consideration 
all available 
information and, 
in particular, 
newly reported 
loss and 
claim experience. 
Changes in 
 reserves resulting 
from such 
re-evaluations are 
reflected in 
incurred losses 
in the period 
when the re-evaluation 
 is 
made. 
Our 
analytical 
methods 
and 
processes 
operate 
at 
multiple 
levels 
including 
individual 
contracts, 
 groupings of 
like contracts, 
classes and 
lines of business, 
internal business 
units, segments, 
accident years, 
legal 
 entities, 
and 
in 
the 
aggregate. 
In 
order 
to 
set 
appropriate 
reserves, 
we 
make 
qualitative 
and 
quantitative 
 analyses 
and 
judgments 
at 
these 
various 
levels. 
We 
utilize 
actuarial 
science, 
business 
expertise 
and 
 management judgment 
in a manner 
intended to 
ensure the accuracy 
and consistency 
of our reserving 
practices. 

 Management s 
best estimate 
is developed 
through 
collaboration 
with actuarial, 
underwriting, claims, 
legal 
and 
 finance 
departments 
and 
culminates 
with 
the 
input 
of 
reserve 
committees. 
Each 
segment 
reserve 
committee 
 includes the participation of the relevant parties 
from actuarial, finance, claims and segment senior management 
 and has 
the responsibility 
for recommending 
and approving 
management s 
best estimate. 
Reserves are 
further 
 reviewed 
by 
Everest s 
Chief 
Reserving 
Actuary 
and 
senior 
management. 
The 
objective 
of 
such 
process 
is 
to 
 determine 
a 
single 
best 
estimate 
viewed 
by 
management 
to 
be 
the 
best 
estimate 
of 
its 
ultimate 
loss 
liability. 

 Nevertheless, our reserves are estimates, 
which are subject to variation, 
which may be significant. 
 There 
can 
be no 
assurance 
that reserves 
for, 
and losses 
from, 
claim obligations 
will not 
increase 
in the 
future, 
 possibly 
by 
a 
material 
amount. 
However, 
we 
believe 
that 
our 
existing 
reserves 
and 
reserving 
methodologies 
 lessen 
the 
probability 
that 
any 
such 
increase 
would 
have 
a 
material 
adverse 
effect 
on 
our 
financial 
condition, 
 results of operations or cash flows. 

 We 
have 
included 
ranges 
for 
loss 
reserve 
estimates 
determined 
by 
our 
actuaries, 
which 
have 
been 
developed 
 through 
a 
combination 
of 
objective 
and 
subjective 
criteria. 
Our 
presentation 
of 
this 
information 
may 
not 
be 
 directly comparable 
to similar presentations 
of other companies 
as there are 
no consistently 
applied actuarial or 

59 
 accounting standards 
governing such presentations. 
Our recorded reserves 
are an aggregation 
of our best 
point 
 estimates 
for 
approximately 
200 
reserve 
groups 
and 
reflect 
our 
best 
point 
estimate 
of 
our 
liabilities. 
Our 
 actuarial methodologies develop 
point estimates 
rather than ranges 
and the ranges 
are developed subsequently 
 based upon historical and prospective 
variability measures. 

 The 
following 
table 
below 
represents 
the 
reserve 
levels 
and 
ranges 
for

 ______________________________________________________ 
 (1)
 There can be no assurance that reserves 
will not ultimately exceed the 
indicated ranges requiring additional 
income (loss) statement expense. 
 Depending 
on 
the 
specific 
segment, 
the 
range 
derived 
for 
the 
loss 
reserves, 
excluding 
reserves 
for 
A E 
 exposures, 
ranges 
from minus 
7.4 to 
minus 9.9 
for the 
low range 
and from 
plus 7.8 
to plus 
10.8 for 
the 
 high range. 
Both the higher 
and lower ranges 
are associated 
with the Insurance 
segment. 
The size of 
the range 
 is 
dependent 
upon 
the 
level 
of 
confidence 
associated 
with 
the 
reserve 
estimates. 
Within 
each 
range, 
 management s 
best 
estimate 
of 
loss 
reserves 
is 
based 
upon 
the 
point 
estimate
 derived 
by 
our 
actuaries 
in 
 detailed reserve 
studies. 
Such ranges 
are necessarily 
subjective due 
to the 
lack of 
generally 
accepted actuarial 
 standards with 
respect to their 
development. 
There can be 
no assurance that 
our claim obligations 
will not vary 
 outside of these ranges. 

 Additional losses, including 
those relating to 
latent injuries, and 
other exposures, which 
are as yet 
unrecognized, 
 the type 
or magnitude 
of which 
cannot be 
foreseen 
by us 
or the 
reinsurance 
and insurance 
industry 
generally, 
 may 
emerge 
in 
the 
future. 
Such 
future 
emergence, 
to 
the 
extent 
not 
covered 
by 
existing 
retrocessional 
 contracts, 
could have 
material 
adverse 
effects 
on our 
future financial 
condition, 
results of 
operations 
and cash 
 flows. 

 Asbestos and Environmental 
Exposures. 
A E exposures represent a separate 
exposure group for monitoring 
and 
 evaluating reserve adequacy. 

 With 
respect 
to 
asbestos 
only, 
at 
December 
31, 
2022, 
we 
had 
net 
asbestos 
loss 
reserves 
of 
 233 
million, 
or 
 90.5 , of total net A E reserves, all of which was 
for assumed business. 

 See 
Note 
3 
of 
Notes 
to 
Consolidated 
Financial 
Statements 
for 
a 
summary 
of 
Asbestos 
and 
Environmental 
 Exposures. 

 Ultimate 
loss 
projections 
for 
A E 
liabilities 
cannot 
be 
accomplished 
using 
standard 
actuarial 
techniques. 
We 
 believe 
that 
our 
A E 
reserves 
represent 
management s 
best 
estimate 
of the 
ultimate 
liability; 
however, 
there 
 can be no assurance that ultimate loss 
payments will not exceed such reserves, 
perhaps by a significant amount. 

 Industry 
analysts 
use 
the 
 survival 
ratio 
to 
compare 
the 
A E 
reserves 
among 
companies 
with 
such 
liabilities. 

 The survival ratio is typically calculated 
by dividing a company s 
current net reserves by the three year 
average of 

60 
 annual 
paid 
losses. 
Hence, 
the 
survival 
ratio 
equals 
the 
number 
of 
years 
that 
it 
would 
take 
to 
exhaust 
the 
 current reserves 
if future 
loss payments 
were to 
continue at 
historical 
levels. 
Using this 
measurement, 
our net 
 three 
year 
asbestos 
survival 
ratio 
was 
6.9 
years 
at 
December 
31, 
2022. 
These 
metrics 
can 
be 
skewed 
by 
 individual large settlements 
occurring in the 
prior three years 
and therefore, 
may not be 
indicative of 
the timing 
 of future payments. 

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

 Capital. 
Shareholders 
equity at 
December 31, 
2022 and 
December 31, 
2021 was 
 8.4 billion 
and 10.1 
billion, 
 respectively. 
Management s 
objective 
in 
managing 
capital 
is 
to 
ensure 
its 
overall 
capital 
level, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
 capital 
levels 
of 
its 
operating 
subsidiaries, 
exceed 
the 
amounts 
required 
by 
regulators, 
the 
amount 
needed 
to 
 support 
our current 
financial strength 
ratings 
from rating 
agencies and 
our own 
economic capital 
models. 
The 
 Company s capital 
has historically exceeded these benchmark 
levels. 

 Our 
two 
main 
operating 
companies 
Bermuda 
Re 
and 
Everest 
Re 
are 
regulated 
by 
the 
Bermuda 
Monetary 
 Authority BMA 
and 
the 
State 
of 
Delaware, 
Department 
of 
Insurance, 
respectively. 
Both 
regulatory 
bodies 
 have their 
own capital 
adequacy models 
based on 
statutory capital 
as opposed 
to GAAP basis 
equity. 
Failure to 
 meet 
the 
required 
statutory 
capital 
levels 
could 
result 
in 
various 
regulatory 
restrictions, 
including 
business 
 activity and the payment of dividends to 
their parent companies. 

 The regulatory targeted 
capital and the actual statutory 
capital for Bermuda Re and Everest 
Re were as follows:

Regulatory targeted capital represents 
the target capital level from 
the applicable year's BSCR calculation.

Regulatory targeted capital represents 
200 of the RBC authorized control 
level calculation for the applicable 
year. 

 (3) 

 The 2022 BSCR calculation is not 
yet due to be completed; 
however, 
the Company anticipates that 
Bermuda Re's December 
31, 2022 actual capital will 
exceed 
 the targeted capital level.
 Our financial strength 
ratings as determined 
by A.M. Best, Moody s 
and Standard Poor s 
are important as 
they 
 provide 
our 
customers 
and 
investors 
with 
an 
independent 
assessment 
of 
our 
financial 
strength 
using 
a 
rating 
 scale that provides 
for relative comparisons. 
We continue 
to possess significant 
financial flexibility and 
access to 
 debt 
and 
equity markets 
as a 
result 
of our 
financial 
strength, 
as evidenced 
by 
the 
financial strength 
ratings 
as 
 assigned by independent rating agencies. 
See also ITEM 1, Business Financial Strength Ratings . 

 We maintain 
our own economic 
capital models 
to monitor 
and project 
our overall 
capital, as 
well as, the 
capital 
 at 
our 
operating 
subsidiaries. 
A 
key 
input 
to 
the 
economic 
models 
is 
projected 
income 
and 
this 
input 
is 
 continually compared to actual results, 
which may require a change in the capital 
strategy. 

 In 2022, 
we repurchased 
241,273 shares 
for 61 
million in 
the open 
market 
and paid 
 255 million 
in dividends. 

 During 
2021, 
we 
repurchased 
887,622 
shares 
for 
 225 
million 
in 
the 
open 
market 
and 
paid 
 247 
million 
in 
 dividends. 
We may 
at times enter 
into a 
Rule 10b5-1 repurchase 
plan agreement 
to facilitate 
the repurchase 
of 
 shares. 
On 
May 
22, 
2020, 
our 
existing 
Board 
authorization 
to 
purchase 
up 
to 
30 
million 
of 
our 
shares 
was 
 amended to 
authorize 
the purchase 
of up 
to 32 
million shares. 
As of 
December 31, 
2022, we 
had repurchased 
 30.8 million shares under this authorization. 

 We repurchased 
 6 million of our 
long term subordinated 
notes during the 
third quarter of 
2022 and recognized 
 a gain 
of 1 
million on 
the repurchase. 
We 
may continue, 
from time 
to time, 
to 
seek to 
retire 
portions of 
our 
 outstanding 
debt 
securities 
through 
cash 
repurchases, 
in 
open-market 
purchases, 
privately 
negotiated 
 transactions 
or 
otherwise. 
Such 
repurchases, 
if 
any, 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
and 
depend 
on 
prevailing 
market 

61 
 conditions, 
our 
liquidity 
requirements, 
contractual 
restrictions 
and 
other 
factors. 
The amounts 
involved 
in 
any 
 such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, 
may be material. 

 On October 7, 
2020, we 
issued 
an additional 
 1.0 billion of 
30 year senior 
notes with 
an interest 
coupon rate 
of 
 3.5 . 
These senior notes will mature on October 
15, 2050 and will pay interest 
semi-annually. 

 On October 4, 
2021, we 
issued an 
additional 1.0 
billion of 31 
year senior 
notes with 
an interest 
coupon rate 
of 
 3.125 . 
These senior notes will mature on October 15, 2052 and 
will pay interest semi-annually. 
 Liquidity. 
Our liquidity 
requirements 
are generally 
met from 
positive 
cash flow 
from operations. 
Positive 
cash 
 flow results 
from reinsurance 
and insurance 
premiums being 
collected prior 
to disbursements 
for claims, 
which 
 disbursements 
generally 
take 
place 
over 
an 
extended 
period 
after 
the 
collection 
of 
premiums, 
sometimes 
a 
 period of many 
years. 
Collected premiums 
are generally 
invested, 
prior to 
their use in 
such disbursements, 
and 
 investment 
income provides 
additional funding 
for loss 
payments. 
Our net 
cash flows 
from operating 
activities 
 were 3.7 
billion and 
 3.8 billion 
for the 
years 
ended December 
31, 2022 
and 2021, 
respectively. 
Additionally, 
 these cash 
flows reflected 
net catastrophe 
loss payments 
of 677 
million and 
 834 million 
for the 
years 
ended 
 December 31, 
2022 
and 2021, 
respectively 
and net 
tax 
payments 
of 171 
million and 
 98 million 
for the 
years 
 ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

 If disbursements 
for claims 
and benefits, 
policy acquisition 
costs and 
other operating 
expenses 
were to 
exceed 
 premium inflows, 
cash flow 
from reinsurance 
and insurance 
operations 
would be 
negative. 
The effect 
on cash 
 flow 
from 
insurance 
operations 
would 
be 
partially 
offset 
by 
cash 
flow 
from 
investment 
income. 
Additionally, 
 cash inflows 
from investment 
maturities - both 
short-term investments 
and longer 
term maturities 
are available 
 to supplement other 
operating cash 
flows. 
We do not 
expect to supplement 
negative insurance 
operations cash 
 flows from investment dispositions. 
 As the 
timing of 
payments for 
claims and 
benefits cannot 
be predicted 
with certainty, 
we maintain 
portfolios of 
 long 
term 
invested 
assets 
with 
varying 
maturities, 
along 
with 
short-term 
investments 
that 
provide 
additional 
 liquidity 
for 
payment 
of claims. 
At 
December 
31, 
2022 
and 
December 
31, 
2021, 
we 
held 
cash 
and short 
-term 
 investments 
of 
 2.4 
billion 
and 
 2.6 
billion, 
respectively. 
Our 
short-term 
investments 
are 
generally 
readily 
 marketable 
and can 
be converted 
to cash. 
In addition 
to these 
cash and 
short-term investments, 
at December 
 31, 2022, we had 
 1.3 billion of 
available for 
sale fixed 
maturity securities 
maturing within one 
year or less, 
 7.5 
 billion maturing 
within one 
to 
five years 
and 
 5.3 billion 
maturing 
after 
five 
years. 
Our 
 281 million 
of 
equity 
 securities 
are 
comprised 
primarily 
of 
publicly 
traded 
securities 
that 
can 
be 
easily 
liquidated. 
We 
believe 
that 
 these fixed 
maturity and equity securities, 
in conjunction with the short 
-term investments and 
positive cash flow 
 from operations, 
provide ample 
sources of 
liquidity for 
the expected 
payment 
of losses 
in the 
near future. 
We 
 do not anticipate selling 
a significant amount 
of securities or using available 
credit facilities to 
pay losses and LAE 
 but have 
the ability to 
do so. 
Sales of securities 
might result 
in realized capital 
gains or losses. 
At December 31, 
 2022 
we 
had 
 1.9 
billion 
of 
net 
pre-tax 
unrealized 
depreciation 
related 
to 
available 
for 
sale 
fixed 
maturity 
 securities, 
comprised 
of 
 2.0 
billion 
of 
pre-tax 
unrealized 
depreciation 
and 
 81 
million 
of 
pre-tax 
unrealized 
 appreciation. 

 Management generally 
expects annual 
positive cash 
flow from operations, 
which reflects 
the strength 
of overall 
 pricing. 
However, 
given the recent 
set of catastrophic 
events, cash 
flow from operations 
may decline 
and could 
 become negative in the near term as 
significant claim payments are 
made related to the catastrophes. 
However, 
 as indicated 
above, 
the Company 
has ample 
liquidity to 
settle its 
catastrophe 
claims and/or 
any 
payments 
due 
 for its catastrophe 
bond program. 

 In addition to our cash flows from operations 
and liquid investments, we also have 
multiple active credit facilities 
 that 
provide 
commitments 
of 
up 
to 
 1.5 
billion 
of 
collateralized 
standby 
letters 
of 
credit 
to 
support 
business 
 written by 
our Bermuda operating 
subsidiaries. 
In addition, the 
Company has the 
ability to request 
access to an 
 additional 
 440 
million 
of 
uncommitted 
credit 
facilities, 
which 
would 
require 
approval 
from 
the 
applicable 

62 
 lender. 
There is 
no guarantee 
the uncommitted 
capacity will 
be available 
to us 
on a 
future date. 
See Note 
5 
 Credit Facilities for further details. 

 Exposure to 
Catastrophes. 
Like other insurance 
and reinsurance 
companies, we are 
exposed to 
multiple insured 
 losses arising out of a 
single occurrence, whether a 
natural event, 
such as a hurricane 
or an earthquake, 
or other 
 catastrophe, 
such 
as 
an 
explosion 
at 
a 
major 
factory. 
A 
large 
catastrophic 
event 
can 
be 
expected 
to 
generate 
 insured 
losses 
to 
multiple 
reinsurance 
treaties, 
facultative 
certificates 
and 
direct 
insurance 
policies 
across 
 various lines of business. 

 We focus on 
potential losses that 
could result from 
any single event, 
or series of events 
as part of our evaluation 
 and monitoring 
of our 
aggregate 
exposures 
to 
catastrophic 
events. 
Accordingly, 
we employ 
various 
techniques 
 to estimate 
the amount of 
loss we could 
sustain from 
any single catastrophic 
event or series 
of events in 
various 
 geographic 
areas. 
These 
techniques 
range 
from 
deterministic 
approaches, 
such 
as 
tracking 
aggregate 
limits 
 exposed 
in 
catastrophe-prone 
zones 
and 
applying 
reasonable 
damage 
factors, 
to 
modeled 
approaches 
that 
 attempt 
to 
scientifically 
measure 
catastrophe 
loss 
exposure 
using 
sophisticated 
Monte 
Carlo 
simulation 
 techniques that forecast 
frequency and severity of potential losses 
on a probabilistic basis. 

 No single 
computer 
model or 
group 
of models 
is currently 
capable of 
projecting 
the amount 
and probability 
of 
 loss in 
all global geographic 
regions in 
which we 
conduct business. 
In addition, 
the form, 
quality and 
granularity 
 of underwriting exposure 
data furnished 
by (re)insureds 
is not uniformly 
compatible with the 
data requirements 
 for 
our 
licensed 
models, 
which 
adds 
to 
the 
inherent 
imprecision 
in 
the 
potential 
loss 
projections. 
Further, 
the 
 results 
from 
multiple 
models 
and 
analytical 
methods 
must 
be 
combined 
to 
estimate 
potential 
losses 
by 
and 
 across 
business 
units. 
Also, 
while 
most 
models 
have 
been 
updated 
to 
incorporate 
claims 
information 
from 
 recent 
catastrophic 
events, 
catastrophe 
model 
projections 
are 
still 
inherently 
imprecise. 
In 
addition, 
 uncertainties with respect 
to future climatic patterns 
and cycles could add 
further uncertainty to loss 
projections 
 from models based on historical data. 
 Nevertheless, 
when combined 
with traditional 
risk management 
techniques 
and sound 
underwriting judgment, 
 catastrophe 
models 
are 
a 
useful 
tool 
for 
underwriters 
to 
price 
catastrophe 
exposed 
risks 
and 
for 
providing 
 management with 
quantitative 
analyses with 
which to monitor 
and manage 
catastrophic 
risk exposures 
by zone 
 and across zones for individual and 
multiple events. 

 Projected catastrophe 
losses are 
generally summarized 
in terms 
of the 
PML. 
We define 
PML as 
our anticipated 
 loss, taking 
into account 
contract 
terms and 
limits, caused 
by a 
single catastrophe 
affecting 
a broad 
contiguous 
 geographic 
area, 
such 
as 
that 
caused 
by 
a 
hurricane 
or 
earthquake. 
The 
PML 
will 
vary 
depending 
upon 
the 
 modeled simulated 
losses 
and the 
make-up 
of the 
in force 
book 
of business. 
The projected 
severity 
levels 
are 
 described 
in 
terms 
of return 
periods , 
such 
as 
 100-year 
events 
and 
 250-year 
events . 
For 
example, 
a 
100-
 year PML is 
the estimated loss 
to the current 
in-force portfolio 
from a single 
event which has 
a 1 probability 
of 
 being exceeded in 
a twelve month 
period. 
In other words, it 
corresponds to a 
99 probability that 
the loss from 
 a 
single 
event 
will 
fall 
below 
the 
indicated 
PML. 
It 
is 
important 
to 
note 
that 
PMLs 
are 
estimates. 
Modeled 
 events are 
hypothetical events 
produced by 
a stochastic 
model. 
As a result, 
there can be 
no assurance 
that any 
 actual event 
will align 
with the 
modeled event 
or that 
actual losses 
from events 
similar to 
the modeled 
events 
 will not vary materially from the modeled event 
PML. 

 From 
an 
enterprise 
risk 
management 
perspective, 
management 
sets 
limits 
on 
the 
levels 
of 
catastrophe 
loss 
 exposure we 
may underwrite. 
The limits are 
revised periodically 
based on a 
variety of factors, 
including but not 
 limited 
to 
our 
financial 
resources 
and 
expected 
earnings 
and 
risk/reward 
analyses 
of 
the 
business 
being 
 underwritten. 
 Management estimates 
that the projected 
net economic loss 
from its largest 
100-year event in 
a given zone is 
to 
 an 
Earthquake 
event 
affecting 
California 
which 
represents 
approximately 
6.9 
of 
its 
December 
31, 
2022 
 shareholders 
equity. 
Economic 
loss 
is the 
PML 
exposure, 
net of 
third 
party 
reinsurance 
including 
catastrophe 
 industry loss 
warranty 
cover, 
reduced by 
estimated 
reinstatement 
premiums 
to renew 
coverage 
and estimated 

63 
 income taxes. 
The impact 
of income 
taxes 
on the 
PML depends 
on the 
distribution 
of the 
losses 
by corporate 
 entity, 
which is 
also affected 
by 
inter-affiliate 
reinsurance. 
Management 
also monitors 
and controls 
its largest 
 PMLs at 
multiple points 
along the 
loss distribution 
curve, such 
as loss 
amounts at 
the 20, 
50, 100, 
250, and 
500 
 year return 
periods. 
This process 
enables management 
to identify 
and control 
exposure 
accumulations 
and to 
 integrate such exposures 
into enterprise risk, underwriting and capital 
management decisions. 

 Our 
catastrophe 
loss 
projections, 
segmented 
by 
risk 
zones, 
are 
updated 
quarterly 
and 
reviewed 
as 
part 
of 
a 
 formal risk management review 
process. 

 We 
believe 
that our 
greatest 
worldwide 1 
in 100 
year 
exposure 
to a 
single catastrophic 
event 
is to 
a hurricane 
 event 
affecting 
Southeast 
U.S., 
where 
we 
estimate 
we 
have 
a 
PML 
exposure, 
net 
of 
third 
party 
reinsurance 
 including catastrophe 
industry loss warranty 
cover, 
of 878 million. See also 
table under ITEM 
1, Business - 
Risk 
 Management of Underwriting and Retrocession 
Arrangements . 

 If such a single catastrophe 
loss were to occur, 
management estimates that 
the net economic loss to us would be 
 approximately 
 515 
million. 
The 
estimate 
involves 
multiple 
variables, 
including 
which 
Everest 
entity 
would 
 experience the loss, and as a result there can be no 
assurance that this amount would not be exceeded. 
 We may 
purchase reinsurance 
to cover specific 
business written 
or the potential 
accumulation or aggregation 
of 
 exposures 
across 
some or 
all of 
our operations. 
Reinsurance 
purchasing 
decisions 
consider 
both 
the 
potential 
 coverage 
and 
market 
conditions 
including 
the 
pricing, 
terms, 
conditions, 
availability 
and 
collectability 
of 
 coverage, with the 
aim of securing cost 
effective protection 
from financially secure counterparts. 
The amount of 
 reinsurance purchased has varied 
over 
time, reflecting our view of our exposures 
and the cost of reinsurance. 

 Information 
Technology. 
Everest s 
information 
technology 
is 
a 
key 
component 
of 
its 
business 
operations. 

 Information 
technology 
systems 
and 
services 
are 
hosted 
at 
public 
and 
private 
cloud 
service 
providers 
across 
 multiple 
datacenters 
with 
processing 
performed 
at 
the 
office 
locations 
of 
our 
operating 
subsidiaries 
and 
 branches. 
We have 
implemented security 
procedures, 
and regularly 
assess and 
enhance our 
security protocols, 
 to ensure 
that our 
key business 
systems 
are protected, 
secured and 
backed up 
at off-site 
locations so 
that they 
 can be restored 
promptly if necessary. 
We have business 
continuity plans and disaster 
recovery plans along with 
 periodic testing 
of those 
plans 
to 
ensure 
we are 
capable 
of providing 
uninterrupted 
technology 
services in 
the 
 event of major systems 
outages with alternative secure datacenters 
available in case of broader outages. 

 Our 
business 
operations 
depend 
on 
the 
proper 
functioning 
and 
availability 
of 
our 
information 
technology 
 platform, 
which 
includes 
data 
processing 
and 
related 
electronic 
communications. 
We 
communicate 
 electronically 
internally 
and 
externally 
with 
our 
brokers, 
program 
managers, 
clients, 
third-party 
vendors, 
 regulators, 
and 
others. 
These 
communications 
and 
the 
data 
we 
handle 
may 
include 
personal, 
confidential 
or 
 proprietary 
information. 
We 
ensure 
that 
all 
our 
systems, 
data 
and 
electronic 
transmissions 
are 
appropriately 
 protected with the latest technology 
safeguards and meet regulatory 
standards. 

 Despite these safeguards, 
a significant cyber incident, 
including system 
failure, security 
breach and disruption 
by 
 malware or other 
damage could 
interrupt or delay 
our operations 
and possibly our 
results. 
This type of incident 
 may result 
in a 
violation of 
applicable data 
security, 
privacy, 
or other 
laws, damage 
our reputation, 
cause a 
loss 
 of customers 
or give 
rise to 
regulatory 
scrutiny 
as well 
as monetary 
fines and 
other penalties. 
Management 
is 
 not aware of a cybersecurity incident that 
has had a material impact on our operations.

 (2)
 Loss and LAE reserves 
represent management s 
best estimate of 
losses from claim 
and related settlement 
costs. 
Both the amounts 
and timing of such 
payments are 
 estimates, and 
the inherent 
variability of 
resolving claims as 
well as 
changes in 
market conditions 
make the 
timing of 
cash flows 
uncertain. 
Therefore, 
the ultimate 
 amount and timing of loss and LAE payments could differ 
from our estimates. 

 The cash 
outflows for 
senior notes 
and long 
term notes 
are the 
responsibility 
of Holdings. 
We 
strive to 
ensure 
 that 
we 
have 
sufficient 
cash 
flow, 
liquidity, 
investments 
and 
access 
to 
capital 
markets 
to 
satisfy 
these 
 obligations. 
Holdings generally 
depends upon 
dividends from 
Everest 
Re, its 
operating 
insurance 
subsidiary for 
 its funding, 
capital contributions 
from Group 
or access 
to the 
capital markets. 
Our various 
operating 
insurance 
 and reinsurance 
subsidiaries 
have 
sufficient 
cash 
flow, 
liquidity 
and investments 
to settle 
outstanding 
reserves 
 for losses and LAE. 
Management believes that 
we, and each of our entities, 
have sufficient financial 
resources or 
 ready access thereto, to 
meet all obligations. 

 Dividends. 
 During 2022 
and 2021, 
we declared 
and paid 
common shareholder 
dividends 
of 255 
million and 
 247 million, 
 respectively. 
As 
an insurance 
holding 
company, 
we 
are 
partially 
dependent 
on dividends 
and other 
permitted 
 payments from 
our subsidiaries 
to pay 
cash dividends 
to our 
shareholders. 
The payment 
of dividends 
to Group 
 by 
Holdings 
Ireland 
and 
Everest 
Dublin

is 
subject 
to 
Irish 
corporate 
and

Management 
expects 
that, 
absent 
extraordinary 
 catastrophe 
losses, such restrictions 
should not affect 
Everest Re s 
ability to declare 
and pay 
dividends sufficient 
 to 
support

that

For the years 
ended December 31, 2022 
and 2021, Everest

 Market Sensitive Instruments. 

 The SEC s 
Financial Reporting 
Release 
#48 requires 
registrants 
to clarify 
and expand 
upon the 
existing 
financial 
 statement 
disclosure 
requirements 
for 
derivative 
financial 
instruments, 
derivative 
commodity 
instruments 
and 
 other financial instruments (collectively, 
 market sensitive 
instruments ). 
We do not generally 
enter into market 
 sensitive instruments for trading 
purposes. 

65 
 Our 
current 
investment 
strategy 
seeks 
to 
maximize 
after-tax 
income 
through 
a 
high 
quality, 
diversified, 
fixed 
 maturity 
portfolio, 
while 
maintaining 
an 
adequate 
level 
of 
liquidity. 
Our 
mix 
of 
investments 
is 
adjusted 
 periodically, 
consistent 
with 
our 
current 
and 
projected 
operating 
results 
and 
market 
conditions. 
The 
fixed 
 maturity 
securities 
in 
the 
investment 
portfolio 
are 
comprised 
of 
non-trading 
securities. 
Additionally, 
we 
have 
 invested in equity securities. 

 The 
overall 
investment 
strategy 
considers 
the 
scope 
of 
present 
and 
anticipated 
Company 
operations. 
In 
 particular, 
estimates 
of 
the 
financial 
impact 
resulting 
from 
non-investment 
asset 
and 
liability 
transactions, 
 together 
with our 
capital 
structure 
and other 
factors, 
are used 
to 
develop 
a net 
liability analysis. 
This analysis 
 includes estimated payout 
characteristics for 
which our investments 
provide liquidity. 
This analysis is considered 
 in the development of specific investment 
strategies for asset 
allocation, duration and 
credit quality. 
The change 
 in overall market sensitive 
risk exposure principally reflects 
the asset changes that took place during the period. 

 Interest Rate 
Risk. 
Our 29.9 billion investment 
portfolio at December 
31, 2022, is principally 
comprised of fixed 
 maturity 
securities, 
which 
are 
generally 
subject 
to 
interest 
rate 
risk 
and 
some 
foreign 
currency 
exchange 
rate 
 risk, and some equity securities, which are subject to price 
fluctuations and some foreign exchange 
rate risk. 
The 
 overall 
economic 
impact 
of 
the 
foreign 
exchange 
risks 
on 
the 
investment 
portfolio 
is 
partially 
mitigated 
by 
 changes 
in 
the 
dollar 
value 
of 
foreign 
currency 
denominated 
liabilities 
and 
their 
associated 
income 
statement 
 impact. 

 Interest 
rate 
risk is 
the potential 
change in 
value of 
the fixed 
maturity securities 
portfolio, 
including short-term 
 investments, 
from 
a 
change 
in 
market 
interest 
rates. 
In 
a 
declining 
interest 
rate 
environment, 
it 
includes 
 prepayment 
risk 
on 
the 
 4.0 billion 
of mortgage 
-backed 
securities 
in 
the 
 23.1 billion 
fixed 
maturity 
portfolio. 

 Prepayment risk results 
from potential accelerated 
principal payments that 
shorten the average 
life and thus 
the 
 expected yield of the security. 

 The tables below 
display the 
potential impact 
of market 
value fluctuations 
and after-tax 
unrealized appreciation 
 on our 
fixed maturity 
portfolio (including 
 1.0 billion 
of short-term 
investments) 
for the 
period indicated 
based 
 on 
upward 
and 
downward 
parallel 
and 
immediate 
100 
and 
200 
basis 
point 
shifts 
in 
interest 
rates. 
For 
legal 
 entities 
with 
a 
U.S. 
dollar 
functional 
currency, 
this 
modeling 
was 
performed 
on 
each 
security 
individually. 
To 
 generate appropriate 
price estimates on mortgage 
-backed securities, changes in prepayment 
expectations under 
 different interest 
rate environments 
were taken 
into account. 
For legal entities 
with a non-U.S. dollar 
functional 
 currency, 
the effective 
duration 
of the 
involved portfolio 
of securities 
was used 
as a 
proxy 
for the 
market 
value 
 change under the various interest 
rate change scenarios.

 We 
had 22.1 
billion and 
 19.0 billion 
of gross 
reserves for 
losses and 
LAE as 
of December 
31, 2022 
and 2021, 
 respectively. 
These 
amounts 
are 
recorded 
at 
their 
nominal 
value, 
as 
opposed 
to 
present 
value, 
which 
would 
 reflect a discount 
adjustment to reflect the 
time value of money. 
Since losses are paid 
out over a period of 
time, 
 the present 
value of 
the reserves 
is less 
than the 
nominal value. 
As interest 
rates 
rise, the 
present value 
of the 
 reserves decreases and, 
conversely, 
as interest rates 
decline, the present value 
increases. 
These movements are 
 the opposite of the interest 
rate impacts on the 
fair value of investments. 
While the difference between 
present 
 value and 
nominal value 
is not reflected 
in our financial 
statements, our 
financial results 
will include investment 
 income over 
time from 
the investment 
portfolio until 
the claims 
are paid. 
Our loss 
and loss 
reserve obligations 
 have 
an 
expected 
duration 
of 
approximately 
3.8 
years, 
which 
is 
reasonably 
consistent 
with 
our 
fixed 
income 
 portfolio. 
If 
we 
were 
to 
discount 
our 
loss 
and 
LAE 
reserves, 
net 
of 
ceded 
reserves, 
the 
discount 
would 
be 
 approximately 
 3.6 billion resulting 
in a discounted 
reserve balance 
of approximately 
 16.4 billion, 
representing 
 approximately 67.9 of the value 
of the fixed maturity investment 
portfolio funds. 

 Equity Risk. 
Equity risk is 
the potential change 
in fair and/or 
market value 
of the common 
stock, preferred 
stock 
 and mutual fund portfolios 
arising from changing prices. 
Our equity investments 
consist of a diversified 
portfolio 
 of individual 
securities and 
mutual funds, 
which invest 
principally in 
high quality 
common and 
preferred 
stocks 
 that are 
traded on 
the major exchanges. 
The primary 
objective of 
the equity 
portfolio is 
to obtain 
greater total 
 return relative to our core 
bonds over time through market 
appreciation and income. 

 The tables below display the impact on fair/market 
value and after-tax change 
in fair/market value 
of a 10 and

 Foreign Currency 
Risk. 
Foreign currency 
risk is the 
potential change 
in value, 
income and 
cash flow arising 
from 
 adverse 
changes 
in 
foreign 
currency 
exchange 
rates. 
Each 
of 
our 
non-U.S./Bermuda foreign 
operations 
 maintains 
capital 
in 
the 
currency 
of 
the 
country 
of 
its 
geographic 
location 
consistent 
with 
local 
regulatory 
 guidelines. 
Each 
foreign 
operation 
may 
conduct 
business in 
its local 
currency, 
as well 
as the 
currency 
of other 
 countries 
in 
which 
it 
operates. 
The 
primary 
foreign 
currency 
exposures 
for 
these 
foreign 
operations 
are 
the 
 Canadian 
Dollar, 
the 
Singapore 
Dollar, 
the 
British 
Pound 
Sterling 
and 
the 
Euro. 
We 
mitigate 
foreign 
exchange 
 exposure 
by 
generally 
matching 
the 
currency 
and 
duration 
of 
our 
assets 
to 
our 
corresponding 
operating 
 liabilities. 
In 
accordance 
with 
FASB 
guidance, 
the 
impact 
on 
the 
market 
value 
of 
available 
for 
sale 
fixed 
 maturities due 
to changes 
in foreign 
currency exchange 
rates, 
in relation 
to functional 
currency, 
is reflected 
as 
 part of 
other comprehensive 
income. 
Conversely, 
the impact 
of changes 
in foreign 
currency exchange 
rates, 
in 
 relation to functional 
currency, 
on other assets 
and liabilities is 
reflected through 
net income as 
a component 
of 
 other income 
(expense). 
In addition, 
we translate 
the assets, 
liabilities and income 
of non-U.S. 
dollar functional 
 currency 
legal 
entities 
to 
the 
U.S. 
dollar. 
This 
translation 
amount 
is 
reported 
as 
a 
component 
of 
other 
 comprehensive income. 

67 
 The tables below display 
the potential impact of a 
parallel and immediate 10 
and 20 increase and decrease 
in 
 foreign exchange 
rates 
on the 
valuation 
of invested 
assets subject 
to foreign 
currency exposure 
for the 
periods 
 indicated. 
This 
analysis 
includes 
the 
after-tax 
impact 
of 
translation 
from 
transactional 
currency 
to 
functional 
 currency 
as 
well 
as 
the 
after-tax 
impact 
of 
translation 
from 
functional 
currency 
to 
the 
U.S. 
dollar 
reporting 
 currency.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
 As 
required 
by 
Rule 
13a-15(b) 
of 
the 
Securities 
Exchange 
Act 
of 
1934 
(the 
 Exchange 
Act ), our 
management, 
 including our Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Financial Officer, 
has evaluated the effectiveness 
of our disclosure 
 controls 
and procedures 
(as defined 
in Rule 
13a-15(e) under 
the Exchange 
Act). 
Based on 
that evaluation, 
the 
 Chief 
Executive 
Officer 
and 
Chief 
Financial 
Officer 
have 
concluded 
that 
our disclosure 
controls 
and procedures 
 were effective as of the 
end of the period covered by this annual report. 
 Management s Report 
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 
 Our 
management 
is 
responsible 
for 
establishing 
and 
maintaining 
adequate 
internal 
controls 
over 
financial 
 reporting. 
Our 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
is designed 
to 
provide 
reasonable 
assurance 
regarding 
 the 
reliability 
of 
financial 
reporting 
and 
the 
preparation 
of 
our 
financial 
statements 
for 
external 
purposes 
in 
 accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. 

 Because 
of 
its 
inherent 
limitations, 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
may 
not 
prevent 
or 
detect 
 misstatements. 
Also, projections 
of any evaluation 
of effectiveness 
to future periods 
are subject to 
the risk that 
 controls 
may 
become inadequate 
because 
of changes 
in conditions, 
or that 
the degree 
of compliance 
with the 
 policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

 Management has 
assessed the 
effectiveness 
of our 
internal control 
over financial 
reporting as 
of December 
31, 
 2022. 
In making this assessment, we used the 
criteria set forth by the Committee 
of Sponsoring Organizations 
of 
 the Treadway 
Commission (COSO) 
in 
 Internal Control 
 Integrated 
Framework (2013)
 . 
Based on 
our assessment 
 we concluded 
that, as 
of December 
31, 2022, 
our internal 
control 
over financial 
reporting is

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Everest Re Group, 
Ltd. 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal 
Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance 
sheets of Everest Re Group, Ltd. and its subsidiaries 
 (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and 
the related consolidated statements of operations and 
 comprehensive income (loss), of changes in shareholders' 
equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in 
 the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related 
notes and financial statement schedules listed in the 
 index appearing on page F-1 (collectively referred to as 
the consolidated financial statements ). We also have 
 audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as 
of December 31, 2022, based on criteria 
 established in 
 Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
 Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to 
above present fairly, in all material respects, 
 the financial position of the Company as of December 
31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and 
 its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 
December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting 
 principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in 
 all material respects, effective internal control over financial 
reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on 
 criteria established in 
 Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 
(2013) issued by the COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated 
financial statements, for maintaining 
 effective internal control over financial reporting, and for 
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control 
 over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal 
Control over Financial Reporting 
 appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions 
on the Company s consolidated financial 
 statements and on the Company's internal control over financial 
reporting based on our audits. We are a public 
 accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting 
Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and 
 are required to be independent with respect to the Company in 
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws 
 and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards 
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan 
 and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements are 
 free of material misstatement, whether due to error or 
fraud, and whether effective internal control over 
 financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included 
performing procedures to assess the risks of 
 material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, 
whether due to error or fraud, and performing 
 procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures 
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding 
 the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the 
 accounting principles used and significant estimates made 
by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
 presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our 
audit of internal control over financial reporting 
 included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial 
reporting, assessing the risk that a 
 material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control 
 based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing 
such other procedures as we considered 
 necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits 
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control 
over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process 
designed to provide reasonable assurance 
 regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation 
of financial statements for external purposes 
 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
A company s internal control over financial 
 reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) 
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in 

F-3 
 reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions 
and dispositions of the assets of the company; 
 (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
 statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of 
 the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations 
of management and directors of the 
 company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized 
 acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets 
that could have a material effect on the financial 
 statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial 
reporting may not prevent or detect 
 misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness 
to future periods are subject to the risk that 
 controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 
 policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising 
from the current period audit of the 
 consolidated financial statements that was communicated 
or required to be communicated to the audit 
 committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures 
that are material to the consolidated financial 
 statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, 
or complex judgments. The communication 
 of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion 
on the consolidated financial statements, taken as 
 a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical 
audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the 
 critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to 
which it relates. 
 Valuation of the Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment 
Expenses 
 As described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial 
statements, the Company maintains reserves equal to 
 the estimated ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment 
expense for reported and unreported claims for 
 both insurance and reinsurance businesses. The Company s 
reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses as 
 of December 31, 2022 was 22.1 billion. Reserves are based 
on estimates of ultimate losses and loss adjustment 
 expenses by underwriting or accident year. Management 
uses a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to 
 monitor reserve adequacy over time, evaluate new information 
as it becomes known and adjust reserves as 
 warranted. Management considers many factors when setting reserves 
including (i) exposure base and projected 
 ultimate premium; (ii) expected loss ratios by product 
and class of business, which are developed collaboratively 
 by underwriters and actuaries; (iii) actuarial methodologies and 
assumptions which analyze loss reporting and 
 payment experience, reports from ceding companies and historical 
trends, such as reserving patterns, loss 
 payments and product mix; (iv) current legal interpretations 
of coverage and liability; and (v) economic 
 conditions. 

 The principal considerations for our determination that 
performing procedures relating to the valuation of the 
 reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses is a critical audit 
matter are the significant judgment by 
 management when developing their estimate; this in turn 
led to a high degree of auditor subjectivity, judgment 
 and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the audit 
evidence relating to the methodologies and the 
 significant assumptions related to expected loss ratios 
and historical trends, such as reserving patterns, loss 
 payments and product mix, and the audit effort involved 
the use of professionals with specialized skill and 
 knowledge. 

 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures 
and evaluating audit evidence in connection with 
 forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 
These procedures included testing the 
 effectiveness of controls relating to management s valuation 
of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment 
 expenses, including controls over the selection of methodologies and 
development of significant assumptions. 

 These procedures also included, among others, testing 
the completeness and accuracy of data provided by 
 management and the involvement of professionals with specialized 
skill and knowledge to assist in performing 
 procedures for a sample of products and lines of business 
including: (i) evaluating management s methodologies 
 and assumptions related to expected loss ratios and historical 
trends, such as, reserving patterns, loss payment 

F-4 
 and product mix used for determining reserves for losses and 
loss adjustment expenses; and (ii) developing an 
 independent estimate of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment 
expenses and comparing the independent 
 estimate to management s actuarially determined reserves.

The market value 
of securities for the single 
 issuer 
(the 
United 
States 
government) 
whose 
securities 
comprised 
the 
largest 
unrealized 
loss 
position 
at 
 December 31, 2022, 
did not exceed 
 
 of the 
overall market 
value of the 
Company s 
fixed maturity 
securities. 

 The market value of the securities 
for the issuer with the second largest 
unrealized loss comprised less 
than 

of the Company s 
fixed maturity 
securities. 
In addition, as indicated 
on the above table, 
there was no 
significant 
 concentration of unrealized 
losses in any one market 
sector. 
The 

billion of unrealized 
losses related to 
fixed 
 maturity securities that 
have been in an 
unrealized loss position 
for less than one 
year were generally 
comprised 
 of 
domestic 
and 
foreign 
corporate 
securities, 
asset-backed 
securities, 
agency 
residential 
mortgage-backed 
 securities and 
foreign 
government 
securities. 
Of these 
unrealized 
losses, 

billion were 
related 
to securities 
 that 
were 
rated 
investment 
grade 
by 
at 
least 
one 
nationally 
recognized 
statistical 
rating 
agency. 
The 

million of 
unrealized 
losses related 
to fixed 
maturity securities 
in an 
unrealized 
loss position 
for more 
than one 
 year 
related 
primarily 
to 
domestic 
and 
foreign 
corporate 
securities, 
agency 
residential 
mortgage-backed 
 securities and 
foreign government 
securities. 
Of these unrealized 
losses, 

million were 
related to 
securities 
 that were rated 
investment 
grade by 
at least one 
nationally recognized 
statistical 
rating agency. 
In all instances, 
 there 
were 
no projected 
cash 
flow shortfalls 
to 
recover 
the full 
book 
value 
of the 
investments 
and the 
related 
 interest obligations. 
The mortgage-backed securities still 
have excess credit coverage 
and are current on interest 
 and principal payments. 

 The 
Company, 
given 
the 
size 
of 
its 
investment 
portfolio 
and 
capital 
position, 
does 
not 
have 
the 
intent 
to 
sell 
 these securities; and it is more 
likely than not that 
the Company will not have 
to sell the security before 
recovery 
 of 
its 
cost 
basis.

 Variable Interest 
Entities 
 The 
Company 
is 
engaged 
with 
various 
special 
purpose 
entities 
and 
other 
entities 
that 
are 
deemed 
to 
be 
VIEs 
 primarily 
as 
an 
investor 
through 
normal 
investment 
activities 
but 
also 
as 
an 
investment 
manager. 
A 
VIE 
is 
an 
 entity that 
either has 
investors 
that lack 
certain essential 
characteristics 
of a 
controlling 
financial interest, 
such 
 as simple 
majority kick-out 
rights, or 
lacks sufficient 
funds to 
finance its 
own activities 
without financial 
support 
 provided 
by 
other 
entities. 
The 
Company 
performs 
ongoing 
qualitative 
assessments 
of 
its 
VIEs 
to 
determine 
 whether the Company has 
a controlling financial interest 
in the VIE and therefore 
is the primary beneficiary. 
The 
 Company 
is 
deemed to 
have 
a 
controlling 
financial 
interest 
when 
it 
has 
both 
the 
ability to 
direct 
the 
activities 
 that most 
significantly impact 
the economic 
performance of 
the VIE 
and the 
obligation to 
absorb losses 
or right 
 to 
receive 
benefits 
from 
the 
VIE 
that 
could 
potentially 
be 
significant 
to 
the 
VIE. 
Based 
on 
the 
Company s 
 assessment, 
if it 
determines 
it 
is 
the 
primary 
beneficiary, 
the 
Company 
consolidates 
the 
VIE 
in 
the 
Company s 
 Consolidated Financial Statements. 
As of December 31, 2022 and 
2021, the Company did 
 
 t hold any securities 
 for which it is the primary beneficiary. 
 The 
Company, 
through 
normal 
investment 
activities, 
makes 
passive 
investments 
in 
general 
and 
limited 
 partnerships 
and other 
alternative 
investments. 
For these 
non-consolidated 
VIEs, the 
Company has 
determined 
 it is not the 
primary beneficiary as 
it has no ability 
to direct activities 
that could significantly 
affect the economic 
 performance of the 
investments.

of December 31, 2022

Assets 
in 
the 
Company's 
 Consolidated 
Balance 
Sheets. 
As 
of 
December 31, 
2022, 
the 
Company 
has 
outstanding 
commitments 
totaling 

billion whereby the 
Company is committed 
to fund these investments 
and may be called 
by the partnership 
 during 
the 
commitment 
period 
to 
fund 
the 
purchase 
of 
new 
investments 
and 
partnership 
expenses. 
These 
 investments are generally 
of a passive nature in that the Company 
does not take an active role in management. 
 In 
addition, 
the 
Company 
makes 
passive 
investments 
in 
structured 
securities 
issued 
by 
VIEs 
for 
which 
the 
 Company 
is 
not 
the 
manager. 
These 
investments 
are 
included 
in 
asset-backed 
securities, 
which 
includes 
 collateralized 
loan obligations 
and are 
classified as 
fixed maturities. 
The Company 
has not 
provided financial 
or 
 other support 
with respect 
to these 
investments 
other than 
its original 
investment. 
For these 
investments, 
the 
 Company 
determined 
it is 
not 
the primary 
beneficiary 
due 
to 
the relative 
size 
of the 
Company s 
investment 
in 
 comparison 
to 
the 
principal 
amount 
of 
the 
structured 
securities 
issued 
by 
the 
VIEs, 
the 
level 
of 
credit 
 subordination 
which 
reduces 
the 
Company s 
obligation 
to 
absorb 
losses 
or 
right 
to 
receive 
benefits 
and 
the 
 Company s 
inability to 
direct the activities 
that most 
significantly impact 
the economic 
performance of 
the VIEs. 

 The 
Company s 
maximum 
exposure 
to 
loss 
on 
these 
investments 
is 
limited 
to 
the 
amount 
of 
the 
Company s 
 investment.

 Gross and 
net reserves 
increased in 
2022, reflecting 
an increase 
in underlying 
exposure due 
to earned 
premium 
 growth, year 
over year, 
the impact 
of 

million of 
incurred losses 
related to 
the Ukraine/Russia 
war, 
partially 
 offset by decrease of 

million in 2022 current year catastrophe 
losses compared to 2021. 

 The war in 
the Ukraine 
is ongoing 
and an evolving 
event. Economic 
and legal 
sanctions have 
been levied against 
 Russia, 
specific 
named 
individuals 
and 
entities 
connected 
to 
the 
Russian 
government, 
as 
well 
as 
businesses 
 located 
in 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
and/or 
owned 
by 
Russian 
nationals 
by 
numerous 
countries, 
including 
the 
 United States. 
The significant 
political and 
economic uncertainty 
surrounding 
the war 
and associated 
sanctions 
 have impacted economic and investment 
markets both within Russia and around 
the world. 
 The 
increase 
in 
current 
year 
incurred 
losses 
from 
2020 
to 
2021 
was 
primarily 
related 
to 
an 
increase 
of 

million in 
current year 
catastrophe 
losses and 
an increase 
of 

million in 
current year 
attritional losses. 
The 
 increase in 
current year 
attritional losses 
was mainly 
due to 
the growth 
in premiums 
earned, partially 
mitigated 
 by 

million of losses related to COVID-19 
in 2020 which did not recur in 2021. 

 Incurred prior years 
losses were ) million in 2022, million in 2021 and 

million in 2020. The favorable 
 development 
on 
prior 
year 
reserves 
of 
million 
in 
2022 
is 
primarily 
driven 
by 
better 
than 
expected 
loss 
 emergence in 
workers 
compensation and 
surety lines 
of business, as 
well as attritional 
property. 
The favorable 
 development 
on 
prior 
year 
reserves 
of 
million 
in 
2021 
is 
primarily 
driven 
by 
a 
commutation 
and 
reserve 
 releases 
within 
the 
reinsurance 
segment. 
The 
increase 
for 
2020 
primarily 
related 
to 
higher 
ultimate 
loss 
 estimates 
for 
long-tail 
casualty 
business 
in 
the 
reinsurance 
segment 
for 
accident 
years 
2015 
to 
2018, 
notably 
 general 
liability, 
professional 
lines, 
and 
auto 
liability. 
The 
reserve 
charge 
also 
includes 
actions 
on 
non-CAT 
 property 
lines, 
primarily 
for 
the 
2017 
to 
2019 
accident 
years 
and 
driven 
by 
a 
few 
large 
losses 
to

 programs.

exposure 
groupings 
to 
develop 
 reserve estimates. 
One of 
the key 
selection characteristics 
for the 
exposure groupings 
is the 
historical duration 
 of 
the 
claims 
settlement 
process. 
Business 
in 
which 
claims 
are 
reported 
and 
settled 
relatively 
quickly 
are 
 commonly 
referred 
to 
as 
short 
tail 
lines, 
principally 
property 
lines. 
Casualty 
claims 
tend 
to 
take 
longer 
to 
be 
 reported and settled and casualty 
lines are generally referred 
to as long tail lines. Estimates 
of ultimate losses for 
 shorter 
tail 
lines, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
loss 
estimates 
for 
large 
catastrophic 
events, 
generally 
exhibit 
less 
 volatility than those for the longer tail 
lines. 
 The 
Company 
uses 
a 
variety 
of 
actuarial 
methodologies, 
such 
as 
the 
expected 
loss 
ratio 
method, 
chain 
ladder 
 methods, 
and 
Bornhuetter-Ferguson 
methods, 
supplemented 
by 
judgment 
where 
appropriate, 
to 
estimate 
 ultimate loss and LAE for each exposure 
group. 
 Expected Loss Ratio Method: 
The expected loss ratio 
method uses earned premium 
times an expected 
loss ratio 
 to calculate 
ultimate losses for 
a given underwriting or 
accident year. 
This method relies entirely 
on expectation 
 to 
project 
ultimate 
losses 
with 
no 
consideration 
given 
to 
actual 
losses. 
As 
such, 
it 
may 
be 
appropriate 
for 
an 
 immature 
underwriting 
or 
accident 
year 
where 
few, 
if 
any, 
losses 
have 
been 
reported 
or 
paid, 
but 
less 
 appropriate for a more mature 
year. 
 Chain 
Ladder 
Method: 
Chain 
ladder 
methods 
use 
a 
standard 
loss 
development 
triangle 
to 
project 
ultimate 
 losses. 
Age-to-age 
development 
factors 
are 
selected 
for 
each 
development 
period 
and 
combined 
to 
calculate 
 age-to-ultimate 
development 
factors 
which 
are 
then 
applied 
to 
paid 
or 
reported 
losses 
to 
project 
ultimate 
 losses. 
This method relies 
entirely on 
actual paid or 
reported losses 
to project 
ultimate losses. 
No other factors 
 such as 
changes in 
pricing or 
other expectations 
are taken 
into 
account. 
It is 
most appropriate 
for groups 
with 
 homogeneous, stable 
experience where 
past development 
patterns are 
expected to 
continue in 
the future. 
It is 
 least appropriate for groups 
which have changed significantly 
over time or which are more volatile. 
 Bornhuetter-Ferguson 
Method: 
The Bornhuetter 
-Ferguson 
method is 
a combination 
of the 
expected 
loss 
ratio 
 method 
and 
the 
chain 
ladder 
method. 
Ultimate 
losses 
are 
projected 
based 
partly 
on 
actual 
paid 
or 
reported 
 losses 
and 
partly 
on 
expectation. 
Incurred 
but 
not 
reported 
(IBNR) 
reserves 
are 
calculated 
using 
earned 
 premium, an a priori loss ratio, 
and selected age-to-age development 
factors and added to actual 
reported (paid) 
 losses 
to 
determine 
ultimate 
losses. 
It 
is 
more 
responsive 
to 
actual 
reported 
or 
paid 
development 
than 
the 

F-30 

years 
ago. 
There 
are 
significant 
uncertainties 
surrounding

of the liabilities associated 
with 
 certain Mt. McKinley policies, which related 
entirely to A E business and had 
been reinsured by Bermuda Re. 
As 
 consideration 
for entering 
into the 
retrocession treaty, 
Everest 
Re Bermuda 
transferred 
cash of 

million, an 
 amount 
equal 
to 
the 
net 
loss 
reserves 
as 
of 
the 
closing 
date. 
The 
maximum 
liability 
retroceded 
under 
the 
 retrocession treaty 
will be 

million, equal to 
the retrocession 
payment plus 

million. 
The Company 
will 
 retain liability for any 
amounts exceeding the maximum liability 
retroceded under the retrocession 
treaty. 
 On December 20, 2019, the retrocession 
treaty was amended and 
included a partial commutation. 
As a result of 
 this amendment 
and partial 
commutation, gross 
A E reserves 
and correspondingly 
reinsurance receivable 
were 
 reduced by 

million. 
In addition, the maximum liability permitted to 
be retroceded increased to 

million. 

 In 2022 
the Company 
posted 
additional A E 
reserves of 

m, following 
a comprehensive 
actuarial reserving 
 review. 
This 
increase 
in 
reserves 
brings 
the 
Company 
A E 
position 
in 
line 
with 
the 
overall 
industry 
survival 
 ratios.

were 
valued 
by 
investment 
managers 
valuation 
committees 
and 
many 
of 
 these fair values were substantiated 
by valuations from independent third

The Company has procedures

At

manages 
a

which 
had 
a

at 
December

had a 
fair value 
of

31, 2022 and 
December 31, 2021, respectively. 
All prices for 
these securities were 
obtained 
 from publicly published sources or nationally 
recognized pricing vendors. 

 Equity 
securities 
denominated 
in 
U.S. 
currency 
with 
quoted 
prices 
in 
active 
markets 
for 
identical 
assets 
are 
 categorized 
as 
Level 
1 
since 
the 
quoted 
prices 
are 
directly 
observable. 
Equity 
securities 
traded 
on 
foreign 
 exchanges are 
categorized as 
Level 2 due to 
the added input of 
a foreign exchange 
conversion 
rate to determine 
 fair value. 
The Company uses foreign currency 
exchange rates 
published by nationally recognized sources. 

 Fixed maturity 
securities listed in 
the tables have 
been categorized 
as Level 2, since 
a particular security may 
not 
 have 
traded 
but 
the 
pricing 
services 
are 
able 
to 
use 
valuation 
models 
with 
observable 
market 
inputs 
such 
as 
 interest rate yield 
curves and prices for similar fixed 
maturity securities in terms of issuer, 
maturity and seniority. 

 For 
foreign 
government 
securities 
and 
foreign 
corporate 
securities, 
the 
fair 
values 
provided 
by 
the 
third 
party 
 pricing services 
in local 
currencies, and 
where applicable, 
are converted 
to U.S. 
dollars using 
currency exchange 
 rates from nationally recognized 
sources. 

 In 
addition 
to 
the 
valuations 
from 
investment 
managers, 
some

the 
fixed 
maturities 
with 
fair 
values 
 categorized 
as

when 
prices 
are 
not

from 
the

with 
unobservable 
inputs 
using 
 comparable 
market 
information

The 
investment 
managers 
 may obtain 
non-binding price 
quotes for 
the securities 
from brokers. 
The single

who 
are 
recognized 
as 
market 
participants 
in 
the

in 
which 
they 
are

The prices received from 
brokers are 
reviewed for 
reasonableness by the 
third party asset 
 managers 
and 
the

If 
the

Currently, 
however, 
no 
withholding 
tax 
has 
been 
 accrued 
with 
respect 
to 
such 
un-remitted 
earnings 
as 
management 
has 
no 
intention 
of 
remitting 
them. 
The 
 cumulative amount 
that would 
be subject 
to withholding 
tax, if 
distributed, 
is not 
practicable to

The 
 provision 
for 
income 
taxes 
in 
the 
consolidated 
statement 
of 
operations 
and 
comprehensive 
income 
(loss) 
has 
 been determined in 
accordance with the 
individual income of each 
entity and the respective 
applicable tax 
laws. 

 The provision reflects the permanent differences 
between financial and taxable income relevant 
to each entity. 

 The 
Coronavirus 
Aid, 
Relief, 
and 
Economic 
Security CARES 
Act, 
enacted 
on 
March 
27, 
2020, 
provided 
that 
 U.S. 
companies 
could 
carryback 
for 
five 
years 
net 
operating 
losses 
incurred 
in 
2018, 
2019 
and/or 
2020. 
This 
 beneficial 
tax 
provision 
in 
the 
CARES 
Act 
enabled 
the 
Company 
to 
carryback 
its 
significant 
2018 net 
operating 
 losses to prior tax years 
with higher effective tax 
rates of 
 
 versus 
 
 in 2018 and later years. 
As a result, the 
 Company 
was 
able 
to 
record 
a 
net 
income 
tax 
benefit 
from 
the 
five-year 
carryback 
of 

million 
and 
obtain 
 federal income tax cash 
refunds of 

million including interest in 2020. 

 On 
August 
16, 
2022, 
the 
Inflation 
Reduction 
Act 
of 
2022 IRA 
was 
enacted. 
We 
have 
evaluated 
the 
tax 
 provisions 
of 
the 
IRA, 
the 
most 
significant 
of 
which 
are 
the 
corporate 
alternative 
minimum 
tax 
and 
the 
share 
 repurchase excise tax 
and do not expect the legislation to have 
a material impact on our results 
of operations. As 
 the IRS issues additional guidance, we will evaluate 
any impact to our consolidated 
financial statements.

Valuation 
Allowance VA ), 
 respectively. 
The VA is a 
result of our conclusion 
under US GAAP accounting principles 
that the UK, Netherlands, 
 Ireland, Chile, Switzerland, 
France, Germany, 
Singapore, and 
U.S. jurisdictions could 
not demonstrate 
that it was 
 more likely 
than not 
that the 
related deferred 
tax assets 
will be realized. 
This was 
primarily due 
to factors 
such 
 as cumulative losses 
in recent years 
related to 
COVID 19 and 
market conditions 
and the inability 
to demonstrate 
 overall 
profitability 
within 
the 
specific 
jurisdiction. 
During 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022,

losses on 
 available

securities. 
The unrealized 
losses 
on available

 The tax benefits related to

 For 
the

the 
Company

 There 
are 
certain 
regulatory 
and 
contractual 
restrictions 
on 
the 
ability 
of 
Holdings 
operating 
subsidiaries 
to 
 transfer 
funds to 
Holdings in 
the form 
of cash 
dividends, loans 
or advances. 
The insurance 
laws of 
the State 
of 
 Delaware, where 
Holdings direct 
insurance subsidiaries 
are domiciled, require 
regulatory 
approval before 
those 
 subsidiaries can pay dividends or make 
loans or advances to Holdings that exceed 
certain statutory thresholds. 
 Capital Restrictions.
 In 
Bermuda, 
Bermuda 
Re 
is 
subject 
to 
the 
BSCR administered 
by 
the 
BMA. 
No regulatory 
action 
is taken 
if an 
 insurer s 
capital 
and 
surplus 
is equal 
to 
or 
in 
excess 
of their 
enhanced 
capital 
requirement 
determined 
by 
the 
 BSCR model. 
In addition, 
the BMA 
has 
established 
a target 
capital 
level for 
each insurer, 
which is 
 
 of 
the 
 enhanced capital requirement. 
 In 
the 
United 
States, 
Everest 
Re 
is 
subject 
to 
the 
RBC developed 
by 
the 
NAIC 
which 
determines 
an 
authorized 
 control 
level risk-based 
capital. 
As long 
as the 
total adjusted 
capital 
is 
 
 or 
more of 
the authorized 
control 
 level capital, no action is required by 
the Company. 
 The regulatory targeted 
capital and the actual statutory 
capital for Bermuda Re and Everest 
Re were as follows:

Actual capital 

(1)
 
 of the RBC authorized control level calculation for the applicable 
year. 
 (3)
 The 2022 BSCR calculation is not yet due to be completed; however, 
the Company anticipates that Bermuda Re's December 31, 2022 actual capital 
will exceed the targeted capital 
 level.

 , promptly issue the Letter of Credit

Days 
after 
its 
receipt 
of 
the 
Application 
therefor) by issuing the original

 Bank 
and

Inquiries, 
communications 
and 
instructions 
 (whether written, facsimile or in other electronic form approved by Bank) regarding a 
 Letter of Credit, an Application and this Agreement are each referred to herein as 
 
 Instructions
 . 

 Bank s 
records 
of 
the 
content 
of 
any 
Instruction 
will 
be 
conclusiv
 e, 
absent manifest error. 
Further, except 
as required by the terms of this 
 Agreement, and except as may be provided in a Letter of Credit or otherwise 
 specifically agreed to in writing by Bank in its sole discretion, Bank shall have no duty 
 to: (i) issue a replacement Letter of Credit on or before the expiry date of any Letter 
 of Credit or the end of such term; (ii) issue or refrain from issuing any notice, if a 
 Letter Credit permits it to do so, of its election to terminate or cancel the Letter 
 Credit prior to its stated expiry date; (iii) issue or refrain from issuing any notice of its 
 election to refuse to reinstate the amount of any drawing under a Letter of Credit; or 
 (iv) otherwise amend or modify a Letter of Credit. 

(b) 

 General Payment Obligations. 
 For each Letter of Credit, the Account Party shall, as 
 to 
 clause (i) 
below, 
reimburse 
Bank, 
and 
as 
to 
all 
other 
clauses 
below, 
pay 
Bank, 

 in each 
case in Dollars (unless Bank agrees otherwise with Account Party): 

14 
 Confidential 
 (i) 
with respect to a drawing under any Letter of Credit, the amount of each 
 drawing paid by Bank thereunder (such date of payment hereinafter referred to 
 as the 
 Draw Date) no later than the first succeeding Business Day after the 
 Account Party s receipt of notice of such payment by Bank (the 
 Due Date), 
 with 
interest as provided below on the amount so paid by Bank (to the extent 
 not reimbursed prior to 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the Draw Date) for the 
 period from the Draw Date to the date the reimbursement obligation created 
 thereby is satisfied in full (the 
 Payment Date). If the Payment Date is on or 
 prior to the Due Date, such interest shall 
be 
payable 
at 
the 
Base 
 Rate as 
in 
effect 
from 
time 
to 
time 

 during 
the period from the Draw Date to the Payment Date. If the Payment 
 Date is after the Due Date, such interest shall be payable (x) as provided in the 
 preceding sentence during the period from and including the Draw Date to and 
 not including the Due Date, and (y) at the Base Rate as in effect from time to 
 time plus 2 from and including the Due Date to and not including the 
 Payment Date; 

(ii) 

 [ ]

(iii) 
except as otherwise provided in clause (i) above and clause (iv) below, 
 interest on 
 each amount 
payable 
by 
the 
Account 
Party 
under 
the 
applicable 
Credit 

 Documents for each 
day 
from 
and 
including 
the 
date 
such 
payment 
is 
due 
 to and 
not 
including the date of payment, on demand, at a rate per annum 
 equal to the Base Rate as in effect from time to time plus 2 ; 

(iv) 
within ten (10) days of demand, Bank s documented out-of-pocket costs and 
 expenses (including the reasonable and documented legal fees, charges and 
 disbursements of outside counsel to Bank incurred in connection with the 
 protection or enforcement of Bank s rights against 
the Account Party under this 
 Agreement and the other applicable Credit Documents and any correspondent 
 bank s documented 
charges 
related 
thereto), 
with 
interest 
from 
the 
date 
of 

demand by Bank to and not including the date of payment by the Account Party, 
 at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate as in effect from time to time 
 plus 
2 ; 

(v) 
if as a result of any Change in Law, Bank determines that the cost to Bank of 
 issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit is increased (excluding, for purposes 
 of this clause (a)(v), any such increased costs resulting from (A) income taxes, 
 franchise 
taxes 
and 
similar 
taxes 
imposed 
on 
Bank 
by 
any 
taxing 
authorit
 y, any U.S. 
federal withholding taxes imposed under FATCA 
and Other Taxes (in 
 each case as 
to 
which 

 Section 

 2(c) 
 shall 
govern) 
and 
(B) 
changes 
in 
the 

 basis 
of 
taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the U.S. or by 
 the foreign jurisdiction or state under the laws of which Bank is organized or has 
 its lending office or any political subdivision thereof), then the Account Party 
 will pay to Bank, from time to time, within ten (10) days after demand by Bank, 
 which 

15 
 Confidential 
 demand shall 
include 
a 
statement 
of 
the 
basis 
for 
such 
demand 
and 
a 

 calculation 
in reasonable detail of the amount demanded, additional amounts 
 sufficient to compensate Bank for such increased cost. A certificate as to the 
 amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Account Party by Bank, shall be 
 conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error; and 

(vi) 
if Bank determines that any Change in Law affecting Bank or any lending office 
 of Bank or Bank s holding company regarding capital or liquidity requirements 
 has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on Bank s 
capital or 
 on the capital of Bank s holding company as a consequence of this Agreement 
 or the Letters of Credit issued by Bank to a level below that which Bank or 
 Bank s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking 
 into consideration Bank s or its holding company s 
policies with respect to 
 capital adequacy), then from time to time the Account Party will pay to Bank 
 within 
ten (10) days after demand by Bank, which demand shall include a 
 statement of the basis for such demand and a calculation in reasonable detail of 
 the amount 
 demanded, such 
additional 
amount 
or 
amounts 
as 
will 
compensate 
Bank 
or 

 Bank s holding company 
for 
any 
such 
reduction 
suffered. 
A 
certificate 
as 

 to 
such 
amounts submitted to the Account Party by Bank shall be conclusive 
 and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. Bank shall use reasonable 
 efforts to designate a different lending office if such designation will avoid (or 
 reduce the cost to the Account Party of) any event described in the preceding 
 sentence and such designation will not, in Bank s 
good faith judgment, subject 
 Bank to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be 
 disadvantageous to Bank. 

 Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (v) or (vi) above or 
 Section 
 2(c) 
 below 
 (and without limiting the immediately preceding paragraph), Bank shall not be 
 entitled to compensation from the Account Party for any amount arising prior to 
 the date which is 180 days before the date on which Bank notifies the Account 
 Party of such event or circumstance (except that if such event or circumstance is 
 retroactive, then such 180-day period shall be extended to include the period of 
 retroactive effect thereof). 

 Any payments received 
by 
Bank 
pursuant 
to 
the 
Credit 
Documents after 1:00
 
p.m. Eastern shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding 
 Business Day for all purposes under the Credit Documents. 

 (c) 

 Immediately Available Funds; No Withholding. 
 All reimbursements and payments by or 
 on behalf of the Account Party shall be made in immediately available funds, free and 
 clear of and without deduction for any present or future Taxes, set-off 
or other 
 liabilities, to such location as Bank may reasonably designate from time to time. The 
 Account Party shall pay all withholding taxes and Other Taxes 
imposed by any taxing 
 authority on 
 reimbursement or 
payment 
under 
any 
Letter 
of 
Credit 
and 
any 
Credit 
Document, 
a
 nd 
shall indemnify Bank against all liabilities, costs, claims and expenses resulting from 
 Bank having to 
pay 
or 
from 
any 
omission 
to 
pay 
or 
delay 
in 
paying 
any 
 such taxes, 
except 
to 
the extent that such taxes are determined by a court of 
 competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the 

16 
 Confidential 
 gross negligence or willful misconduct of Bank. Any such indemnification payment shall 
 be made within ten (10) days from the date Bank makes written demand therefor. 
 
 Taxes
 means all taxes, fees, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or 
 withholdings of any kind (other than income taxes, franchise taxes and similar taxes 
 imposed on Bank by any taxing authority and any U.S. federal withholding taxes 
 imposed under FATCA). 
 
 Other Taxes
 means all present or future stamp, documentary, 
 excise, property or similar taxes, charges or levies that arise from any payment made 
 hereunder or from the execution, delivery or registration of, 
performance under, or 
 otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any other Credit Document. 

(d) 

 Automatic Debit and Set-Off. 
 Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any 
 Event of Default with respect to the Account Party, 
Bank (which term shall include 
 Bank s branches and affiliates for purposes of this paragraph) may 
(but shall not be 
 required to), without demand for reimbursement or payment or notice to the Account 
 Party, 
and in addition to any other right of set-off that Bank may have, debit any 
 account or accounts, irrespective of the currency of such account or accounts, 
 maintained by 
the 
Account 

 Party 
with 
any 
office 
of 
Bank 
(now 
or 
in 
the 
future) 
and

 balance or deposits (general, special, time, demand, provisional, final, matured or 
 absolute) in the account(s) and (ii) any sums due or payable from Bank, to the payment 
 of any and all Obligations owed by the Account Party to Bank, irrespective of whether 
 Bank shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such Obligations 
 may be contingent or unmatured. 
Bank agrees promptly to notify the Account 
 Party after 

 any 
such 
set-off 
and 
application; 
provided, 
however, 
that 
the 
failure 
to 
give 
such 
 notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. 

(e) 

 Obligations Absolute. 
 The Account Party s reimbursement and payment obligations 
 under this 
 Section 
 2 
 are absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and shall be 
 performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all

 by a Person or a transferee 
 of such 
Person 
purporting

by 
Bank, 
shall 
be 
conclusive 
and 
binding 
for 
all 
purposes, 
absent 
 manifest error; and 
 (vi) 
if Bank determines that any Change in Law affecting Bank or any lending office of Bank or 
 Bank s holding company regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or 
would have the 
 effect of reducing 
the rate 
of return on 
Bank s capital 
or on the capital 
of Bank s 
holding 
 company as a consequence of this Agreement or the Letters of Credit issued 
by Bank to a 
 level below that which Bank or Bank s holding company could have 
achieved but for such 
 Change 
in 
Law 
(taking 
into 
consideration 
Bank s 
or 
its 
holding 
company s 
policies 
with 
 respect to 
capital adequacy), 
then from time 
to time the

detail 
of 
the

 demanded, such 
additional amount 
or amounts 
as will 
compensate Bank or 
Bank s holding 
 company for any such reduction 
suffered. 
A certificate as to such amounts 
submitted 
to 
 the 
Account 
Party 
by 
Bank 
shall 
be 
conclusive 
and 
binding 
for 
all 
purposes, 
absent 
 manifest error. 
 Bank 
shall 
use 
reasonable 
efforts 
to 
designate 
a 
different 
lending 
office 
if 
such 
 designation will avoid (or reduce the cost to the Account Party 
of) any event described in 
 the 
preceding 
sentence 
and 
such 
designation 
will 
not, 
in 
Bank s good 
faith 
judgment, 
 subject 
Bank 
to 
any 
unreimbursed 
cost 
or 
expense 
and 
would 
not 
otherwise 
be 
 disadvantageous to Bank.

on 
which 
Bank 
notifies 
the 
Account 
Party 
of 
such 
event 
or 
 circumstance (except that if such event or circumstance 
is retroactive, then such 180-day 
 period shall be extended to include the period of retroactive 
effect thereof). 
 Any payments received by Bank 
pursuant to the Credit

are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by 
 a 
final 
and 
nonappealable

may be determined by a court of competent 
jurisdiction by a 
 final and nonappealable judgment against 
Bank following reimbursement 
and/or payment 
of the 
 Obligations. 
 (f) 
 Computation 
of Interest

 All computations 
of interest 
and fees 
to be 
 made 
hereunder

any 
other

in excess 
of the 
 maximum lawful rate or (ii)

 that the Account Party not pay or contract to pay, and that Bank not 
receive or contract to receive,

 Final 
Maturity 
Date; 
provided, 
however, 
if 
the 
Account 
Party 
so 
requests 
in 
any 
applicable 
 Application, Bank agrees to 
issue a Letter 
of Credit that 
provides 
for the 
automatic

the beneficiary of

later than 
 60 days 
prior to 
the stated 
maturity 
date specified in such Letter of 
Credit (such time, the 
 Non-
 Extension 
Notice 
Date). 
The 
Account 
Party 
acknowledges 
that 
Bank 
shall 
not 
be 
required 
to 
 extend any Letter of 
Credit if 
Bank has 
determined that 
it would have 
no obligation 
at such 
time 
 to issue such Letter of Credit (as extended) 
under the terms hereof. 

17 
 Confidential 
 (h) 
 Permanent 
Reduction 
of Commitment. 
 The Account 
Party 
shall have 
the right 
at 
any 
time and 
 from time to 
time, upon at least 
three Business Days 
prior irrevocable written 
notice to Bank, 
to 
 permanently reduce, 
without premium 
or penalty, 
(i) the

from time 
to time, 
in an 
aggregate principal 
amount not 
less than 
 3,000,000 or any 
whole multiple of 
 1,000,000 in excess thereof. 
All Commitment Fees accrued
