PART I 
 
 Item 1. Business 
 Overview 
 We are a leading online education platform company. Our mission is to expand access to high-quality education and unlock human potential. As a trusted partner to top-ranked nonprofit universities and other leading organizations, we deliver technology and services that enable our clients to bring their educational offerings online at scale. Through edX, our best-in-class education consumer marketplace with 48 million registered learners, we host a comprehensive range of education offerings, from free courses to degree programs. 
 We serve more than 230 top-ranked global universities and other leading organizations and, together, we offer more than 4,000 high-quality online learning opportunities, including open courses, executive education offerings, boot camps, micro-credentials, professional certificates as well as undergraduate and graduate degree programs. Our offerings cover a wide range of topics including technology, business, healthcare, science, education, social work, and sustainability. Many of our offerings are stackable, providing learners with an affordable pathway to achieve both short-term and long-term professional and educational goals. Our platform provides our clients with the digital infrastructure to launch world-class online education offerings and allows students to easily access high-quality, job-relevant education without the barriers of cost or location. 
 Business Segments 
 We have two reportable segments: the Degree Program Segment and the Alternative Credential Segment. 
 In our Degree Program Segment, we provide technology and services to nonprofit colleges and universities to enable the online delivery of degree programs. Students enrolled in these programs are generally seeking an undergraduate or graduate degree of the same quality they would receive on campus. 
 In our Alternative Credential Segment, we provide premium online open courses, executive education programs, technical, skills-based boot camps and micro-credential programs through relationships with nonprofit colleges and universities and other leading organizations. Students enrolled in these offerings are generally seeking to reskill or upskill for career advancement or personal development through shorter duration, lower-priced offerings. In addition to selling these offerings directly to individuals, we also sell to organizations and institutions, including employers, non-profits, governments and governmental entities to enable upskilling and reskilling of their workforces. 
 Our Platform 
 Our platform consists of a seamlessly integrated ecosystem of technology, people and data. Through our platform, we provide the tools and services our clients need to bring their education offerings online, at scale and we provide learners with flexible, high-quality learning opportunities across an expansive range of topics to support their educational and career goals. 
 edX 
 edX.org provides access to the full catalog of online offerings that we enable, ranging from free offerings to graduate degrees. This thriving marketplace allows us to connect a large base of learners with our comprehensive range of high-quality education offerings and identify new high-intent learners efficiently. 
 Our Technology and Technology-Enabled Services 
 In the Degree Program Segment, we offer our university clients a broad set of technology and services spanning the student journey from pre-enrollment through graduation. Clients can utilize the entire bundle of technology and services that we offer, or a more flexible set of services under our flexible degree model. In the Alternative Credential Segment, we provide technology and services to enable our clients to provide a range of non-degree credentials and other courses to learners. 
 Our Technology 
 Learning Technology For many of our offerings, including all of our open course and micro-credential offerings, our clients leverage an open source learning technology platform (the Open edX Platform ). We have customized this learner-centric, scalable learning platform to enable our clients to easily build and launch offerings on edX. For certain degree, executive education and boot camp offerings, we use other learning platforms that provide an integrated hub for students to access coursework and learning modules, interact with tutors and peers, attend live classes, and review assignment grading and tutor feedback. Our STEM-based education tools and collaborative annotation technology significantly enhance the learning experience for students and the instruction capabilities for faculty.

Integrated Learning and Business Systems We use a variety of proprietary technologies to streamline the launch of our degree programs at scale across multiple schools. Prior to the launch of new degree programs, we also tightly integrate our systems with our university clients systems by building integrations and data connections. These integrations facilitate the secure bi-directional exchange of data to support our degree programs and to automate a variety of processes on an ongoing basis, including admissions and live class scheduling. We also integrate our systems with those of our enterprise clients to allow for secure access to our catalog of offerings directly through our clients corporate learning management systems. 
 Data and Analytics Support Our platform enables us to measure user interactions from their first introduction to the program all the way through completion. This allows us to analyze and understand the types of offerings a given student will be most successful in and helps us determine the level of support they need. In addition, instructors and faculty are able to leverage platform tools so they can better understand how their students are performing and who may need additional help. 
 Our Technology-Enabled Services 
 Student Engagement Services . We provide a broad scope of services to support students at each stage of their learning journey from the enrollment process through post-completion career services. 
 Pre-Enrollment We provide prospective students with transparent information regarding admissions and enrollment requirements, the application process, curriculum, tuition, and time to completion. 
 Student Support In many offerings, we provide students with best-in-class support by assigning a dedicated advisor that is focused on retention and graduation. These advisors provide individualized non-academic support throughout their program by using data analysis and proprietary tools to create personalized coaching plans for students, and ensure student questions on asynchronous content or coursework receive a timely response from an advisor or teaching assistant. 
 Post-Completion We provide students and alumni of our clients offerings with access to industry-aligned resources designed to support students in achieving their career goals following program completion through our Career Engagement Network. These services include resume and interview tools, live coaching and workshops as well as career fairs and employer referrals to our strong network of employer partnerships around the world. 
 Curriculum and Learning Services. Our platform enables faculty of our university clients to author and publish high-quality content for their offerings efficiently. We provide course strategy and design consultation services and other self-help resources to assist faculty in creating engaging course content. For certain offerings, our learning design and development experts collaborate with faculty to produce high-quality, engaging, online coursework and content for our university clients offerings. We use a variety of technology tools that allow us to scale our curriculum and learning services, including a learning management system to author and host asynchronous learning activities and make real-time updates in certain quickly evolving fields. We also use tools to streamline scheduling, grading and student collaboration in the virtual learning environment for students and professors. We also recruit, hire and train faculty to teach the executive education and boot camp offerings for our clients. 
 Marketing Services. Our marketing efforts center on using the strength of the edX brand and the popularity of edX.org to enable learners to find our offerings through free or low-cost acquisition channels. The edX platform gives us access to a large global audience, a comprehensive library of educational content, and a trusted brand with significant consumer recognition. Through data analytics and machine learning techniques, we connect learners with the appropriate high-quality learning experiences based on their skill sets and learning goals. We also deploy program-specific marketing campaigns, primarily for our university clients degree programs. These campaigns leverage our university clients brands and approved messaging to generate interest in a particular program. 
 University Faculty Support Services . We provide a range of other services to enable the success of our university clients online degree programs and allow them to focus on their core academic functions. 
 Admissions While our university clients are solely responsible for setting admissions standards and making admissions decisions, we provide technology-enabled services to streamline the admissions process by assisting prospective students in the application process and organizing and routing completed student application packages to the university s admissions office. 
 Placement Using our global network of clinics, hospitals, schools and other sites, our field placement team secures local placements for students enrolled in degree programs such as nursing, social work, teaching and 
 5 

Table of Contents 

other programs that require field placements to satisfy curriculum and accreditation requirements. We have integrated placements into our learning technology to enable students, faculty and field placement supervisors to monitor completion of student field work directly from our platform. 
 Faculty Success We provide a dedicated team to support and train university administration and faculty on how to use our platform to facilitate high-quality live instruction. In addition, we help our university clients succeed by assisting with faculty recruiting efforts, including attracting, cultivating and vetting a pool of faculty candidates for our university clients. 
 Key Benefits of our Platform 
 We believe our platform provides the following key benefits: 
 Extend Institutional Reach and Impact . Our platform enables our clients to extend their brands and increase their impact by delivering high-quality education offerings to students anywhere in the world at a wide range of prices and credential levels. 
 Comprehensive Scope of Offerings . We provide a broad range of education offerings to students that range from free open courses to graduate degree programs. Our breadth of offerings allows students to gain the skills and credentials they need to reach their career and personal goals and provides the flexibility to stack credentials to progress towards a more advanced credential or degree. 
 Marketing Reach and Trusted Brand . We believe edX.org, together with its strong consumer-facing brand, enables our clients to efficiently reach a large audience of potential students. As we continue to expand the scope of offerings on edX, we believe we will generate additional interest in our offerings among students and incentivize clients to create additional offerings ranging from free-to-degree. 
 Outcomes. Our platform allows students to pursue a wide range of high-quality education offerings provided by leading universities and other top-tier institutions. Through these offerings, students obtain valuable skills and credentials that can create upward career mobility, facilitate a transition to a new field and lead to personal enrichment. 
 Turnkey Solution . Our platform provides a broad set of capabilities that would otherwise require universities to purchase multiple, disparate point solutions, and significantly increase headcount in marketing, data analytics, technology and other areas, particularly with respect to degree offerings. 
 Scalable Support. High-quality student support is central to our services. We provide student support that is tailored to student needs and offering type. For many of our offerings our support teams work with prospective students prior to enrollment as they consider and apply to a particular offering. Once enrolled, we augment the academic experience by assigning a dedicated advisor to provide ongoing individualized non-academic support and career guidance for certain offerings. 
 Low Financial Risk for Clients . We make many of the initial investments required to launch new offerings across our portfolio. In our Degree Program Segment, in particular, we make significant investments in technology, integration, content production, marketing, student and faculty support, and other services. Our revenue-share model, combined with long contractual terms in this segment, enables us to make these investments without significant financial risk to our university clients. 
 Our Growth Strategy 
 We intend to continue our industry leadership as a provider of a digital education platform that enables our clients to deliver high-quality online education at scale and provides students with lifelong learning opportunities to unlock their potential. Our approach to growth is disciplined and focused on long-term success. The principal elements of our strategy are: 
 Adding Offerings and Increasing Enrollments . We intend to add additional top-tier universities and other entities to our client base and to increase the number of offerings we power on behalf of our existing client base. edX allows potential students to search for and find courses of interest from free-to-degree efficiently. 
 Adding New Offering Types. We intend to continue evolving our offering portfolio to meet the demands of lifelong learners particularly in rapidly evolving fields. This evolution could include new offering types, course bundles or stacks, or additional credentialing options. 
 Broadening Enterprise Channel. We believe continuing to expand our enterprise channel presents a significant opportunity for us. Our deep catalog of over 4,000 high-quality free-to-degree offerings enables us to partner with a 
 6 

Table of Contents 

wide range of institutions seeking to upskill and train employees at any level of their organizations in job-relevant subject areas. We also intend to expand our work with governments, local workforce agencies as well as corporations and nonprofits to provide lifelong learning and skills training to fill pressing workforce needs often in technology focused fields. 
 Expanding Globally. edX generates significant global web traffic and has a large non-US learner base. We believe this creates a significant opportunity to expand our offerings with top-tier international universities and other entities and to attract additional non-US learners to our existing offerings. We also intend to grow our geographic reach by adding offerings to edX from other digital education providers that have a strong non-U.S. university client base. 
 Clients 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had more than 230 clients with more than 4,000 offerings. Our clients are nonprofit colleges and universities as well as leading corporations and non-profit entities. 
 Competition 
 The overall market for technology solutions that enable higher education providers to deliver education online is highly fragmented, rapidly evolving and subject to changing technology, shifting needs of students, faculty and clients and frequent introductions of new delivery methods. 
 We face competition from various companies in the online education sector, including companies that provide direct-to-consumer online education offerings, corporate training programs and technology solutions and services to universities that offer online learning programs. Many of these companies provide components of the technology and services we provide, and these companies may choose to pursue some of the institutions we target. Moreover, nonprofit colleges and universities may elect to continue using or develop their own online learning solutions in-house. 
 We expect that the competitive landscape will continue to expand as the market for online education offerings at nonprofit institutions matures. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following: 
 quality and reputation of university client base and track record of performance; 
 robustness and evolution of technology solutions and marketplace capabilities; 
 scope and quality of educational content; 
 strength of brand awareness and reputation among consumers; 
 ability of online education offerings to deliver desired student outcomes; 
 breadth and depth of service offering; 
 ability to make significant investments in launching and operating degree programs; 
 expertise in marketing, student acquisition and student retention; 
 student and faculty experience; 
 ease of deployment and use of technology solutions; and 
 level of customization, configurability, integration, security, scalability and reliability of technology solutions. 
 We believe we compete favorably on the basis of these factors. Our ability to remain competitive will depend, to a great extent, on our ability to consistently deliver high-quality offerings; attract, support and retain students; and deliver desired student, faculty and client outcomes.

Seasonality 
 We experience seasonality in our marketing and sales expense in both our Degree Program Segment and our Alternative Credential Segment. We typically reduce our paid search and other marketing and sales efforts during late November and December because of less demand during the holiday season. We generally do not experience pronounced seasonality in our revenue, although revenue can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to variations driven by the varying academic schedules of our offerings and university clients. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We protect our intellectual property by relying on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and contractual agreements. For example, we rely on trademark protection in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions to protect our rights to various marks, including 2U, NO BACK ROW, GETSMARTER, EDX and other distinctive logos associated with our brand. We continue to evaluate developing and expanding our intellectual property rights in patents, trademarks and copyrights, as available through registration in the United States and internationally. 
 We ensure that we own intellectual property created for us by signing agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants, companies, and any other third party that creates intellectual property for us that assign any intellectual property rights to us. 
 We have also established business procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, including the use of confidentiality agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants and companies with which we conduct business. 
 We also purchase or license technology and other intellectual property that we incorporate into our technology or services. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our technology and services, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. 
 For important additional information related to our intellectual property position, please review the information set forth in Risk Factors Risks Related to Intellectual Property. 
 Education Laws and Regulations 
 The higher education industry is heavily regulated. Institutions of higher education that award degrees and certificates to signify the successful completion of an academic program are subject to regulation from three primary entities: the U.S. Department of Education, or DOE, accrediting agencies and state licensing authorities. Each of these entities promulgates and enforces its own laws, regulations, guidance and standards, which we refer to collectively as education laws. 
 We contract with postsecondary institutions that are subject to education laws. In addition, we ourselves are required to comply with certain education laws as a result of our role as a service provider to institutions of higher education, either directly or indirectly through our contractual arrangements with university clients. Our failure, or that of our university clients, to comply with education laws could adversely impact our operations. As a result, we work closely with our university clients to maintain compliance with education laws. 
 Federal Laws and Regulations 
 Under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, or the HEA, institutions offering postsecondary education must comply with certain laws and related regulations promulgated by the DOE in order to participate in the Title IV federal student financial assistance programs. Most of our university clients participate in the Title IV programs. 
 The HEA and the regulations promulgated thereunder are frequently revised, repealed or expanded. Congress historically has reauthorized and amended the HEA at regular intervals but has failed to do so in recent years. The reauthorization process and congressional oversight of the DOE is nonetheless ongoing, such as oversight and investigations of the education sector and DOE conducted on behalf of Congress by the Government Accountability Office, or GAO. 
 The reauthorization of the HEA, or other legislation, could alter the regulatory landscape of the higher education industry, and thereby impact the manner in which we conduct business and serve our university clients. In addition, the DOE frequently conducts rulemakings that may impact our business and we expect each incoming administration to change the DOE rules in accordance with its policy priorities regardless of whether the HEA is reauthorized by Congress. The DOE also issues formal and informal guidance instructing institutions of higher education and other covered entities how to comply with various federal laws and regulations. DOE guidance is subject to change and such changes may impact our business model.

Although we are not considered an institution of higher education and we do not directly participate in Title IV programs, we are required to comply with certain regulations and guidance promulgated by the DOE as a result of our role as a service provider to institutions that do participate in Title IV programs. These include, for example, regulations governing student privacy under Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA, and the DOE s recent guidance regarding third-party servicers. While online executive education courses and boot camps are typically not eligible for Title IV aid, when offered by or on behalf of Title IV eligible institutions, many education laws, such as FERPA, remain applicable to us or our university clients even in the Alternative Credential Segment. 
 Current DOE rules material to our business include the incentive compensation rule, the misrepresentation rule, the written arrangements rules and state authorization requirements, which are discussed in further detail below. 
 Incentive Compensation Rule 
 The HEA provides that any institution that participates in the Title IV federal student financial assistance programs must agree with the DOE that the institution will not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment to any person or entity engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities as those terms and activities are defined in DOE regulations and policy guidance. 
 Under DOE s incentive compensation regulations, each higher education institution agrees that it will not provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based in any part, directly or indirectly, upon success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid, to any person or entity who is engaged in any student recruitment or admission activity, or in making decisions regarding the award of Title IV, HEA program funds. Pursuant to this rule, we are prohibited from offering our covered employees, who are those involved with or responsible for recruiting or admissions activities, any bonus or incentive-based compensation based on the successful recruitment, admission or enrollment of students into a postsecondary institution. 
 At the time the incentive compensation rule was last revised, in July 2011, the revised rule initially raised a question as to whether entities could be prohibited from entering into tuition revenue-sharing arrangements with university clients. On March 17, 2011, the DOE issued official agency guidance, known as a Dear Colleague Letter, or the DCL, providing guidance on this point. The DCL states that [t]he Department generally views payment based on the amount of tuition generated as an indirect payment of incentive compensation based on success in recruitment and therefore a prohibited basis upon which to measure the value of the services provided and that [t]his is true regardless of the manner in which the entity compensates its employees. But the DCL also provides an important exception to the ban on tuition revenue-sharing arrangements between institutions and third parties. According to the DCL, the DOE does not consider payment based on the amount of tuition generated by an institution to violate the incentive compensation ban if the payment compensates an unaffiliated third party that provides a set of bundled services that includes recruitment services, such as those we provide. Example 2-B in the DCL is described as a possible business model developed with the statutory mandate in mind. Example 2-B describes the following as a possible business model: 
 A third party that is not affiliated with the institution it serves and is not affiliated with any other institution that provides educational services, provides bundled services to the institution including marketing, enrollment application assistance, recruitment services, course support for online delivery of courses, the provision of technology, placement services for internships, and student career counseling. The institution may pay the entity an amount based on tuition generated for the institution by the entity s activities for all the bundled services that are offered and provided collectively, as long as the entity does not make prohibited compensation payments to its employees, and the institution does not pay the entity separately for student recruitment services provided by the entity. 
 The DCL guidance indicates that an arrangement that complies with Example 2-B will be deemed to be in compliance with the incentive compensation provisions of the HEA and the DOE s regulations. Our business model and contractual arrangements with our university clients closely follow Example 2-B in the DCL. In addition, we assure that none of our covered employees are paid any bonus or other incentive compensation in violation of the rule. 
 Because the bundled services rule was promulgated in the form of agency guidance issued by the DOE in the form of a DCL and is not codified by statute or regulation, the rule could technically be altered or removed without customary administrative procedural requirements, such as adequate prior notice, that accompany formal agency rulemaking. Similarly, a court could invalidate the rule in an action involving our company or our university clients, or in an action that does not involve us at all. Finally, while most states defer to DOE regulations, different versions of the federal incentive compensation rule exist under state law, and such statutes or rules, or their interpretation, may change at any time. The revision, removal or invalidation of the bundled services rule by Congress, the DOE or a court could require us to change our business model, and separate revisions at the state level could require us to amend certain of our contracts.

Misrepresentation Rule 
 The HEA prohibits an institution that participates in the Title IV programs from engaging in any substantial misrepresentation regarding three broad subject areas: (i) the nature of the school s education programs, (ii) the school s financial charges and (iii) the employability of the school s graduates. 
 Under the DOE rule, misrepresentation is defined broadly as any false, erroneous or misleading statement, written, visual or oral. This may include even statements that have the likelihood or tendency to deceive. Therefore, a statement need not be intentionally deceitful to qualify as a misrepresentation. Substantial misrepresentation is defined loosely as a misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person s detriment. 
 The regulation also covers statements made by any representative of an institution, including agents, employees and subcontractors, and statements made directly or indirectly to any third party, including state agencies, government officials or the public, and not just statements made to students or prospective students. 
 Violations of the misrepresentation rule are subject to various sanctions by the DOE and violations may be used as a basis for legal action by third parties or as a defense to the obligation to repay student loans. In 2022, DOE completed changes to related borrower defense to repayment regulations including new definitions of aggressive recruitment and misrepresentation (including omission of fact). The new rules could make it significantly easier for students to obtain student loan discharges, in some cases at the institution s expense, and may trigger further scrutiny of marketing or recruiting practices. In addition, the DOE has designated an investigations unit to enforce rules related to deceptive student marketing, which is expected to work with other federal agencies. 
 Similar rules apply under state laws or are incorporated in institutional accreditation standards, and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, applies similar rules that prohibit any unfair or deceptive marketing practices by vendors in the education sector. As a result, we and our employees and subcontractors, as agents of our university clients, must use a high degree of care to comply with such rules and are prohibited by contract from making any false, erroneous or misleading statements about our university clients. To avoid an issue under the misrepresentation rule and similar state and federal rules, we assure that all marketing materials are approved in advance by our university clients before they are used by our employees. 
 Accreditation Rules and Standards 
 Accrediting agencies primarily examine the academic quality of the instructional programs of an educational institution, and a grant of accreditation is typically viewed as confirmation that an institution or an institution s programs meet generally accepted academic standards. Accrediting agencies also review the administrative and financial operations of the institutions they accredit to ensure that each institution has the resources to perform its educational mission. The DOE also relies on accrediting agencies to determine whether institutions qualify to participate in Title IV programs. 
 In addition to institutional accreditation, colleges and universities may require specialized programmatic accreditation for particular educational programs. Many states and professional associations require professional programs to be accredited, and require individuals to have graduated from accredited programs in order to sit for professional license exams. Programmatic accreditation, while not a sufficient basis for institutional Title IV Program certification by the DOE, assists graduates to practice or otherwise secure appropriate employment in their chosen field. Common fields of study subject to programmatic accreditation include teaching and nursing. 
 Although we are not an accredited institution and are not required to maintain accreditation, accrediting agencies are responsible for reviewing an accredited institution s third-party contracts with service providers like us and may require an institution to obtain approval from or to notify the accreditor in connection with such arrangements. One purpose of the notification and approval requirements is to verify that the accredited institution remains responsible for providing academic instruction leading to a credential and provides oversight of other activities undertaken by third parties like us that are within the scope of its accreditation. We work closely with our university clients to assure that the standards of their respective accreditors are met and are not adversely impacted by us. 
 Accrediting agencies are also responsible for assuring that any written arrangements to outsource academic instruction meet accreditation standards and related regulations of the DOE. Our operations are generally not subject to such written arrangements rules because academic instruction is provided by our university client institutions and not by us; however, the written arrangements rules may apply to online programs in the Alternative Credential Segment to the extent such courses are outsourced by university clients.

State Laws and Regulations 
 Each state has at least one licensing agency responsible for the oversight of educational institutions operating within its jurisdiction. Continued approval by such agencies is necessary for an institution to operate and grant degrees, diplomas or certificates in those states. Moreover, under the HEA, approval by such agencies is necessary to maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. State attorneys general are also active in enforcing education laws, and the level of regulatory oversight varies substantially from state to state. 
 We and our university clients may be subject to regulation in each state in which we or they own facilities, provide distance education or recruit students. State laws establish standards for, among other things, student instruction, qualifications of faculty, location and nature of facilities, recruiting practices and financial policies. The need to comply with applicable state laws and regulations may limit or delay our ability to market or expand our offerings. In addition, the interpretation of state authorization regulations is subject to substantial discretion by the state agency responsible for enforcing the regulations. 
 DOE requires, among other things, that an institution offering distance learning or online programs secure the approval of those states which require such approval and provide evidence of such approval to the DOE upon request. This regulation increases the importance of state authorization because failure to obtain the necessary state authorization for online programs (which may also be obtained through participation in a state authorization reciprocity agreement) could result in an obligation to return federal funds received by an institution. The federal state authorization rules were updated in July 2020 to, among other things, require more detailed disclosure requirements about whether particular states have authorized programs that may lead to professional licensure, which created an additional compliance burden for many of our partner institutions. The DOE is currently considering further changes to its state authorization requirements. 
 All states except California now participate in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement, or SARA, governing the licensing of online offerings. All SARA-member institutions may provide online offerings in SARA states without obtaining separate state authorization (this includes externships, recruiting, local advertising, and faculty presence). SARA-member institutions must still obtain a separate authorization in order to open a physical location in another state and are also required to obtain any additional approvals that may be required for offerings leading to professional licensure in a state (e.g., nursing, teaching, or counseling). Most of our university clients are SARA members and the DOE accepts participation in a reciprocity agreement as evidence of state approval. SARA policies and procedures change frequently and must reflect changes in policy instituted by accreditation agencies and the DOE. 
 Finally, many programs leading to professional licensure, such as graduate degree programs in nursing or teaching, also require approval from, and are subject to ongoing oversight by separate state agencies such as state nursing boards. Membership in SARA does not encompass approvals by professional licensing boards, which must be obtained separately. 
 We monitor state law developments closely and work closely with our university clients to assist them with obtaining any required approvals. 
 Other Laws 
 Our activities or those of our university clients are also subject to other federal and state laws. These regulations include, but are not limited to, consumer marketing and unfair trade practices laws and regulations, including those promulgated and enforced by the FTC, state and federal consumer lending laws, including those enforced by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or state agencies, student accessibility requirements, federal and state data protection and privacy requirements and foreign and U.S. anti-corruption regulations.

Our Culture 
 2U was founded on a set of guiding principles that are core to our culture and guide big and small decisions every day. New employees are introduced to the guiding principles in orientation and are expected to bring these guiding principles to life as they work with their teams, interact with our university clients and students or otherwise represent 2U in the community. 
 Cherish each opportunity . Life is short, so treasure every moment. 
 Give a damn . Care about what you do each day. 
 Strive for excellence . Don t settle for second best. 
 Be bold and fearless . Question the status quo and embrace change. 
 Be candid, honest and open . Listen to others and offer respectful feedback. 
 Have fun . Fun is important. Fun is simply better. 
 Make service your mission . Give the highest level of support to our partners and to one another. 
 Don t let the skeptic win . No is easy. Yes is hard. Fight for yes. 
 Relationships matter . Invest the time, build trust, and value differences. 
 Human Capital Measures and Objectives 
 2U is dedicated to eliminating the back row in higher education and our employees are critical to achieving this mission. We believe that when our employees feel appreciated and included they can be more creative, innovative, and better serve our university clients and students. Human capital measures and objectives that we focus on in managing our business include talent acquisition and retention, diversity and inclusion, employee development and training, community involvement and employee engagement and wellness. 
 Talent Acquisition and Retention . We seek to recruit, retain and incentivize highly talented employees and our compensation and benefits programs are aligned with these goals. We are committed to providing total rewards programs for our employees that are market-competitive and based on each employee s contribution and performance. To foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of employees with stockholders, we provide equity compensation in the form of performance and service-based restricted stock units to eligible employees. We also offer eligible employees the ability to participate in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which enables them to purchase shares of our stock at a discount. We also provide comprehensive benefits for employees and their families, which are tailored to the various geographies in which we operate. Depending on the jurisdiction, our benefits may include health insurance coverage, 401(k) matching, paid parental leave, and unlimited paid time off. 
 Diversity and Inclusion . We believe an equitable and inclusive environment with diverse teams produces more creative solutions and results in better outcomes for our university clients and students. We strive to attract, retain and promote diverse talent at all levels of the organization. Our Board is 27 women and 27 people of color and our executive team is comprised of 19 women and 25 people of color. We have established a diversity and inclusion committee, known as Mosaic that serves as a liaison with management on diversity and inclusion issues and we maintain executive-sponsored business resource networks BRNs that offer a forum for employees to network and engage in professional development activities. As of December 31, 2022 we had 7 BRNs focused on the following groups: Black/African American, Women, LGBTQ+, Asian Pacific Islander, Latinx, People Who Are Differently Abled and Parents and Caregivers. To further support our diversity and inclusion goals, starting in 2020 the Company bonus plan included a diversity and inclusion component for our employees at and above the vice president level. 
 Employee Development and Training . We provide a range of mandatory and optional employee development programs and opportunities for employees to develop the skills they need to be successful. Our learning and development teams create and teach a variety of live courses and our employees also have free access to a library of learning resources via LinkedIn Learning. Our diversity and inclusion principles are also reflected in our employee training programs. We require all managers to complete trainings on allyship, unconscious bias, cultural communication and thriving across differences and we offer additional training on emotional intelligence and leading with empathy. In addition, we offer a subscription to edX for employees, which allows eligible employees and a family member to access certain of our offerings.

Community Involvement . We are committed to making an impact in our local communities through volunteering, financial donations, scholarships and other forms of engagement. Our corporate social responsibility program, 2U Engage , supports local non-profit organizations in each location where we have an office with a focus on organizations that are aligned with our mission to provide access to quality education. Employees are encouraged to volunteer for these organizations throughout the year and we provide employees with 24 hours of Volunteer Time Off annually to support nonprofit organizations of their choice. We also organize company sponsored community service events for volunteerism and fundraising. We also endeavor to support the local community through scholarship initiatives, which focus on reaching the Black, Latinx and indigenous communities, as well as women and individuals from low income households. As part of our global community involvement, we partnered with the International Rescue Committee to support a 2U-sponsored scholarship program for its employees. 
 Employee Engagement and Wellness . We strive to create employee programs that promote our guiding principles, support employee wellness and enable employees to work productively. These efforts include providing access to free wellness resources such as meditation and mental health support, a family support benefit to cover fertility treatments, adoptions, surrogacy and a travel benefit for eligible reproductive care services. We regularly survey our employees to assess wellness and additional support needs. A large portion of our full-time workforce is remote or has a hybrid working arrangement, and we are committed to supporting our employees in doing their best work no matter where they are located.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in the Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Risk Factors Summary 
 Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in this section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and summarized below. This risk factor summary does not contain all of the information that may be important to you, and you should read the risk factor summary together with the more detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties set forth following this section as well as elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Risks Related to Our Business Model 
 We have incurred significant net losses since inception and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. 
 Our financial performance depends heavily on our ability to recruit potential students for our offerings, and our ability to do so may be affected by circumstances beyond our control. 
 Our business depends heavily on the adoption by colleges and universities of online delivery of their educational offerings. 
 To launch a new degree program, we typically must incur significant expense in technology and content development, as well as in marketing and sales to identify and attract prospective students, and it may be several years, if ever, before we generate revenue from a new program sufficient to recover our costs. 
 If new offerings do not scale efficiently and in the time frames we expect, our reputation and our revenue will suffer. 
 Our financial performance depends heavily on student retention within our offerings, and factors influencing student retention may be out of our control. 
 Risks Related to Our Operations and Our Growth Strategy 
 Our student acquisition efforts depend in large part upon a limited number of third-party advertising platforms. 
 If our security measures or those of our third-party service providers are breached or fail and result in unauthorized disclosure of data, we could lose clients, fail to attract new clients and be exposed to protracted and costly litigation. 
 Disruption to or failures of our platform could reduce client and student satisfaction with our offerings and could harm our reputation. 
 We face competition from established and emerging companies, which could divert clients or students to our competitors, result in pricing pressure and significantly reduce our revenue. 
 If we do not retain our senior management team and key employees, we may not be able to sustain our growth or achieve our business objectives. 
 If we are unable to maintain and enhance our brand, our reputation and business may suffer. 
 Implementation of our 2022 Strategic Realignment Plan (as defined below) may not be successful, which could affect our ability to increase our profitability. 
 If students do not expand beyond the free offerings available on our platform, our ability to grow our business and improve our results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Capital Structure 
 Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk and prevent us from meeting our obligations with respect to our indebtedness. 
 Despite current indebtedness levels and existing restrictive covenants, we may still incur additional indebtedness that could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial financial leverage. 
 14 

Table of Contents 

To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. 
 We may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Convertible Notes (as defined below) for cash following a fundamental change, or to pay any cash amounts due upon conversion, and our other indebtedness may limit our ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes or pay cash upon their conversion. 
 Conversion of the Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock. 
 We may need additional capital in the future to pursue our business objectives. Additional capital may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, which could compromise our ability to grow our business. 
 Risks Related to Regulation of Our Business and That of Our University Clients 
 Our business model relies on university client institutions complying with federal and state laws and regulations. 
 Our activities are subject to federal and state laws and regulations and other requirements. 
 Activities of the U.S. Congress or DOE could result in adverse legislation or regulatory actions or investigations. 
 Our business model, which depends in part on our ability to receive a share of tuition revenue as payment from our university clients, has been validated by a DOE dear colleague letter, but such validation is not codified by statute or regulation and may be subject to change. 
 If we or our subcontractors or agents violate the incentive compensation rule, we could be liable to our university clients for substantial fines, sanctions or other liabilities. 
 Our future growth could be impaired if our university clients fail to obtain timely approval from applicable regulatory agencies to offer new programs, make substantive changes to existing programs or expand their programs into or within certain states. 
 Evolving regulations and legal obligations related to data privacy, data protection and information security and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations, could have an adverse effect on our business. 
 Risk Factors 
 Risks Related to Our Business Model 
 The evolving scope of our offerings and changes to our operating model make it difficult to predict our future financial and operating results, and we may not achieve our expected financial and operating results in the future. 
 From 2008 to 2017, our offerings generally only consisted of graduate degree programs. In July 2017, we expanded our offerings to include premium online executive education programs and in May 2019, we further expanded our offerings to include skills-based boot camps. In 2020 we launched our first undergraduate degree program and in November 2021 expanded our offerings to include open courses and micro-credentials and added a consumer facing marketplace. Given the significant evolution of our current scope of our offerings and changes to our operating model, our ability to forecast our future operating results, including revenue, cash flows and profitability, is limited and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties are incorrect or change, or if we do not manage these risks successfully, our operating and financial results may differ materially from our expectations and our business may suffer. 
 We have incurred significant net losses since inception and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. 
 We incurred net losses of 322.2 million, 194.8 million and 216.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels and/or reduce operating expenditures in future periods to become profitable, and, even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase our profitability. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, substantial financial and other resources in developing our platform, including expanding our platform offerings, developing or acquiring new platform features and services, expanding into new markets and geographies, developing new content, and on our sales and marketing efforts. Our efforts to grow our business may be more costly than we expect, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability or to increase our revenue enough to offset our operating expenses. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown events. As a result, we may be unable to achieve and maintain profitability, and the value of our company and our common stock could decline significantly.

Our financial performance depends heavily on our ability to recruit potential students for our offerings, and our ability to do so may be affected by circumstances beyond our control. 
 Building awareness of our offerings is critical to our ability to recruit prospective students for our university clients offerings and generate revenue. A substantial portion of our expenses is attributable to marketing and sales efforts dedicated to attracting potential students to our offerings. Because we generate revenue based on a portion of the tuition and fees that students pay, it is critical to our success that we identify prospective students for our offerings in a cost-effective manner, and that enrolled students remain active in our offerings until graduation or completion. 
 We have experienced, and may in the future experience, fluctuations in our student enrollments based on a variety of factors. For example, student enrollments have declined, and may decline in the future, due to our university clients changing their admissions standards and the COVID-19 pandemic led to significant fluctuations in student enrollment across our offerings. 
 The following factors, many of which are largely outside of our control, may prevent us from successfully driving and maintaining student enrollment in our offerings in a cost-effective manner or at all, which would adversely affect our revenue and ability to achieve profitability: 
 Negative perceptions about online learning programs. Online offerings that we or our competitors provide may not be successful or operate efficiently, and new entrants to the market also may not perform well. Such underperformance could create the perception that online offerings in general are not an effective way to educate students, whether or not our offerings achieve satisfactory performance. 
 Unsuccessful marketing efforts. We invest substantial resources in developing and implementing data-driven marketing strategies that focus on identifying the right potential student at the right time. In connection with our platform-based and product-level marketing efforts, we make substantial use of search engine optimization, paid search, social media and custom website development and deployment and we rely on a small number of internet search engines and marketing partners. The effectiveness and cost of our marketing efforts has varied over time and from offering to offering based on economic conditions, competition, advertising prices, offerings type, university client reputation and other factors, including the effectiveness of our marketing partners to identify students and learners. 
 Damage to university client reputation. Because we often use a university client s brand in connection with our marketing efforts for their offerings, our university clients reputations are critical to our ability to enroll students. Many factors affecting our university clients reputations are beyond our control, including ranking among nonprofit educational institutions, internal university matters, changes in university leadership positions and other matters that impact the public perception of our university clients. 
 Lack of interest in an offering. We may encounter difficulties attracting students for offerings that are not highly desired or that are relatively new within their fields. Macroeconomic conditions beyond our control may diminish interest in employment in a field, which could contribute to a lack of interest in offerings related to that field. 
 Reduced support from our university clients. Our ability to grow our revenue from a particular offering depends on the growth of enrollment in that offering. Our university clients could limit enrollment in certain offerings, cease providing the offerings altogether or significantly curtail or inhibit our ability to promote their offerings, any of which would negatively impact our revenue. 
 Our lack of control over our university clients admissions standards and admissions decisions for degree programs. Even if we identify prospective students for a degree program, there is no guarantee that our university clients will admit these students to that program. Our university clients retain complete discretion over setting admissions standards and making admissions decisions, and university clients may change admissions standards or inconsistently apply admissions standards. 
 Inability to maintain sufficient high-quality content from our clients. Our success depends on our ability to provide students with high-quality learning experiences. For certain of our offerings, including our degree programs, while our clients are primarily responsible for curriculum development our learning design and development experts collaborate with faculty to ensure the final course content is engaging and digestible in an online format. For other offerings, including our open course and micro-credential offerings, our clients are solely responsible for curriculum development and we provide limited self-help resources. If the course content in our offerings is not high-quality and students are dissatisfied with their experience in an offering on our platform or do not find the content of our offerings appealing, they may stop accessing our content. In turn, if clients perceive that our platform lacks an adequate learner 
 16 

Table of Contents 

audience, clients may be less willing to provide content to offer on our platform, and the experience of students could be further negatively impacted. 
 Inability of students to secure funding. Like on-campus college and university students, many of the students in our university clients offerings, in particular degree programs and boot camps, rely on the availability of third-party financing to pay for tuition and other costs of their education. This may include federal or private student loans, scholarships and grants, or benefits or reimbursement provided by an employer. Any developments that reduce the availability or increase the cost of financial aid for higher education generally, or for our university clients offerings, could impair students abilities to meet their financial obligations and could negatively impact future enrollment in our offerings. 
 General economic conditions. Student enrollment in our offerings may be affected by changes in global economic conditions. An improvement in economic conditions and, in particular, an improvement in the economic conditions in the U.S. and the U.S. unemployment rate, may reduce demand among potential students for educational services, as they may find adequate employment without additional education. Conversely, a worsening of economic and employment conditions may reduce the willingness of employers to sponsor educational opportunities for their employees or discourage existing or potential students from pursuing additional education due to a perception that there are insufficient job opportunities, increased economic uncertainty or other factors. 
 Our business depends heavily on the adoption by colleges and universities of online delivery of their educational offerings. If we fail to attract new university clients, or if new leadership at existing university clients does not have an interest in continuing or expanding online delivery of their educational offerings, our revenue growth and profitability may suffer. 
 The success of our business depends in large part on our ability to enter into agreements with additional nonprofit colleges and universities to provide their offerings online. In particular, to engage new university clients, we need to convince potential university clients, many of which have been educating students only in on-campus programs for hundreds of years, to invest significant time and resources to introduce a new teaching modality. The delivery of online education at leading nonprofit colleges and universities is evolving, but many administrators and faculty members continue to have concern regarding the perceived loss of control over the education process that might result from offering content online, as well as skepticism regarding the ability of colleges and universities to provide high-quality education online that maintains the standards they set for their on-campus programs. It may be difficult to overcome this resistance, and online offerings of the kind we develop with our university clients may not achieve significant market acceptance. In addition, our university clients have regular turnover in their leadership positions, and there is no guarantee that any new leader will have an interest in continuing or expanding online delivery of the university s educational offerings. If new leaders at our university clients do not embrace online delivery of educational offerings, we may not be able to add additional offerings with the university client and the university client may attempt to terminate or may not renew their relationship with us. 
 The market for our offerings may be limited due to exclusivity provisions in certain of our contracts with university clients. We have agreed to incur, and we may incur in the future, costs to terminate some or all of the exclusivity obligations in certain of our university client contracts. 
 Certain of our contracts with our university clients limit our ability to enable competitive offerings with other schools. In our Degree Program Segment, we have determined that enabling some of these contractually prohibited competitive programs may be part of our business strategy. We have in the past agreed and may in the future agree with certain university clients to do some or all of the following to reduce or eliminate certain exclusivity obligations: make fixed and contingent cash payments over time, reduce our revenue share over time, and/or make minimum investments in marketing under certain conditions. 
 In addition, in order to maintain good relations with our university clients, we may decide not to approach certain institutions that our university clients regard as their direct competitors to offer similar programs or courses, even if we are allowed to do so under our contracts. A limited number of our contracts with our university clients include provisions that may result in pricing adjustments in limited circumstances. If we need to incur contingent costs in connection with enabling competitive offerings or if we determine not to approach certain institutions, or if we have to adjust our pricing provisions, our ability to grow our business and achieve profitability would be impaired. 
 To launch a new degree program, we generally incur significant expense in technology and content development, as well as in marketing and sales to identify and attract prospective students, and it may be several years, if ever, before we generate revenue from a new program sufficient to recover our costs. 
 To launch a new degree program, we generally integrate components of our platform with the various student information and other operating systems our university clients use to manage functions within their institutions. In addition, for these degree programs, our content development staff work closely with the university client s faculty members to produce engaging online coursework and content, and we must commence student acquisition activities. This process is time-consuming and costly and,

under our agreements with our university clients, we are primarily responsible for the significant costs of this effort for most of our degree programs, even before we generate any revenue and there is no guarantee we will ever recoup these costs. 
 In exchange for the upfront investments we make in our university clients degree programs, our university client agreements generally provide that we receive a fixed percentage of the tuition that the university clients receive from the students enrolled in their degree programs. We only begin to recover these upfront costs once students are enrolled and our university clients begin billing students for tuition and fees. The time that it takes for us to recover our investment in a new degree program depends on a variety of factors, primarily our content development costs, student acquisition costs, the rate of growth in student enrollment in the program, and the tuition of the program. We estimate that, on average, it takes approximately three years after signing an agreement with a university client to fully recover our investment in that university client s new degree program. Because of the lengthy period required to recoup our investment in these new degree programs, unexpected developments beyond our control could occur that result in the university client ceasing or significantly curtailing a degree program before we are able to fully recoup our investment. As a result, we may ultimately be unable to recover the full investment that we make in a new degree program or achieve our expected level of profitability for the degree program. 
 If new offerings do not scale efficiently and in the time frames we expect, our reputation and our revenue will suffer. 
 Our continued growth and ability to achieve profitability depends on our and our university clients ability to successfully scale newly launched offerings. Our ability to scale new offerings in the time frame we expect has varied over time and from offering to offering. If we are not successful in recruiting potential students for our offerings, it would adversely impact our ability to generate revenue, and our university clients and the students in their offerings could lose confidence in the knowledge and capability of our employees. If we cannot quickly and efficiently scale our technology to handle growing student enrollment and new offerings, our university clients and their students experiences may suffer, which could damage our reputation among colleges and universities and their faculty and students and impact our ability to acquire new university clients. 
 In addition, in our Degree Program Segment, if our university clients cannot quickly develop the infrastructure and hire sufficient faculty and administrators to handle growing student enrollments, our university clients and their students experiences with our platform may suffer, which could damage our reputation among colleges and universities and their faculty and students. 
 Our ability to efficiently scale new offerings may depend on a number of factors, including our ability to: 
 satisfy existing students in, and attract and enroll new students for, our offerings; 
 assist our university clients in recruiting qualified faculty to support their expanding enrollments; 
 assist our university clients in developing and producing an increased volume of course content; 
 successfully introduce new features and enhancements and maintain a high level of functionality in our platform; and 
 deliver high-quality support to our university clients and their faculty and students. 
 If student enrollments in our offerings do not increase, if we are unable to launch new offerings in a cost-effective manner or if we are otherwise unable to manage new offerings effectively, our ability to grow our business and achieve profitability would be impaired, and the quality of our platform and the satisfaction of our university clients and their students could suffer. 
 Our financial performance depends heavily on student retention within our offerings, and factors influencing student retention may be out of our control. 
 Once a student is enrolled in an offering, we and our university client must retain the student over the life of the offering to generate ongoing revenue. Our strategy involves offering high-quality support to students enrolled in these offerings to support their retention. If we are unable to help students quickly resolve any educational, technological or logistical issues they encounter, otherwise provide effective ongoing support to students or deliver high-quality, engaging educational content, students may withdraw from the offering, which would negatively impact our revenue. 
 In addition, student retention could be compromised by the following factors, many of which are largely outside of our control: 
 Lack of support from faculty members in our university clients degree programs. It takes a significant time commitment and dedication from our university clients faculty members to work with us to develop or to independently develop course content for their degree programs and other courses designed for an online learning environment. Our university clients faculty may be unfamiliar with the development and production process, may not

understand the time commitment involved, or may otherwise be resistant to changing the ways in which they present the same content in an on-campus class. Our ability to maintain high student retention will depend in part on our ability to convince our university clients faculty of the value in the time and effort they will spend developing the course content. Lack of support from faculty could cause the quality of our degree programs to decline, which could contribute to decreased student satisfaction and retention in our Degree Program Segment. 
 Student dissatisfaction. Enrolled students may drop out of our offerings based on their individual perceptions of the value they are getting from the offering. For example, we may face retention challenges as a result of students dissatisfaction with our university clients faculty, changing views of the value of our offerings and perceptions of employment prospects following completion of the offering. 
 Personal factors. Personal factors, such as ability to continue to pay tuition, ability to meet the rigorous demands of the offering, and lack of time to continue classes, all of which are generally beyond our control, may impact a student s willingness and ability to stay enrolled in an offering. 
 If student retention is compromised by any of these factors, it could significantly reduce the revenue that we generate from our offerings, which would negatively impact our return on investment for the particular offering and could compromise our ability to grow our business and achieve profitability. 
 The loss, or material underperformance, of any one of our offerings could harm our reputation, which could in turn affect our future revenue growth. 
 We rely on our reputation for delivering high-quality online educational offerings and recommendations from existing university clients to attract potential new university clients. Therefore, the loss of any single offering, or the failure of any university client to renew its agreement with us upon expiration, could harm our reputation and impair our ability to pursue our growth strategy and ultimately to become profitable. 
 The recent significant decline in the market price of our common stock and the impairment of intangible assets and goodwill arising from our acquisitions could continue to negatively impact and affect our net income and shareholders equity. 
 We review goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of goodwill or an indefinite-lived asset below its carrying value. We experienced a significant decline in the market price of our common stock subsequent to February 9, 2022 that resulted in a triggering event for assessing our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset balances. When we acquire a business, a substantial portion of the purchase price of the acquisition may be allocated to goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we recorded impairment charges of 28.8 million and 30.0 million to goodwill and the indefinite-lived intangible asset, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded impairment charges of 50.2 million and 29.3 million to goodwill and the indefinite-lived intangible asset, respectively. 
 Future declines in the results of our acquisitions and other factors could cause us to record an impairment of all or a portion of the relevant goodwill in the future. We may not be able to achieve our business targets for businesses we previously acquired or will acquire in the future, which could result in our incurring additional goodwill and other intangible assets impairment charges. Further declines in our market capitalization increase the risk that we may be required to perform another impairment analysis, which could result in an impairment of up to the entire balance of our goodwill and other intangible assets based on the quantitative assessment performed. 
 Risks Related to Our Operations and Our Growth Strategy 
 Our student acquisition efforts depend in large part upon a limited number of third-party advertising platforms. 
 Our platform and program-level marketing efforts make substantial use of paid search, social media, search engine optimization and custom website development and deployment and we rely on advertising through a limited number of third-party advertising platforms such as Google, Meta Platforms and LinkedIn, to direct traffic to, and recruit new students for, our offerings. Changes in the way these platforms operate - whether due to changes in law, changes in the practices of mobile operating system providers, or otherwise - or changes in their advertising prices, data use practices, or other terms have impacted the cost and efficiency of our student acquisition efforts in the past and could in the future make marketing our offerings more expensive, or less effective. In addition, the elimination of a particular medium or platform on which we advertise, could limit our ability to direct traffic to our offerings and recruit new students on a cost-effective basis, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

If internet search engines methodologies are modified, our search engine optimization capability in connection with our student recruiting efforts could be harmed. 
 Our search engine optimization capability in connection with our student acquisition efforts substantially depends on various internet search engines, such as Google, to direct a significant amount of traffic to our marketplace at edX.org and other websites related to our offerings. Our ability to influence the number of visitors directed to these websites through search engines is not entirely within our control. For example, search engines frequently revise their algorithms in an attempt to optimize their search result listings. In this respect, we have experienced fluctuations in our search result listings and website traffic based on changes to search engine algorithms, and future algorithm changes by Google or any other search engines could cause edX.org and other websites for our offerings to receive less favorable placements, which could reduce the number of prospective students who visit these websites and impact our ability to effectively utilize search engine optimization as part of our student acquisition strategies in the long-term. Further, if our competitors search engine optimization efforts are more successful than ours, fewer prospective students may be directed to our websites. 
 The U.S. Department of Justice brought several antitrust lawsuits against Google claiming, among other things, that Google improperly uses its monopoly over internet search to impede competition and harm consumers. We cannot predict the impact that these lawsuits may have on advertising costs or Google s future operations. Any reduction in the number of prospective students directed to our websites could negatively affect our ability to generate prospective students, and ultimately revenue, through our student acquisition activities. 
 If our security measures or those of our third-party service providers are breached or fail, resulting in unauthorized disclosure of data, we could lose clients, fail to attract new clients and be exposed to protracted and costly litigation. 
 Our platforms and computer systems store and transmit proprietary and confidential client, student, and company information, which may include personal information of students, prospective students, faculty and employees, subject to stringent legal and regulatory obligations. As a technology company, we have faced and continue to face an increasing number of threats to our platforms and computer systems, including unauthorized activity and access, system viruses, worms, malicious code, denial of service attacks, phishing attacks, ransomware attacks, social engineering attacks, and organized cyberattacks, any of which could breach our security, or threaten an open source platform that we do not control and create a data exfiltration condition and/or disrupt our platform and our clients offerings. The techniques used by computer hackers and cyber criminals to obtain unauthorized access to data or to sabotage computer systems are growing in sophistication, change frequently and generally are not detected until after an incident has occurred. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, an increasing number of cybersecurity threats to our platform and computer systems and to the systems of our third-party service providers and our efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our platform, and the cybersecurity measures taken by our third-party service providers, may be unable to anticipate, detect or prevent all attempts to compromise our systems. While there can be no assurances of effectiveness, we have implemented certain safeguards and processes to thwart hackers, and all related activity, and protect the data in our platforms and computer systems. If our, or our third-party service providers , security measures are breached or fail as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, it could result in the loss or misuse of proprietary and confidential university, student (including prospective student), employee or company information, which could subject us to material liability, or materially interrupt our business, potentially over an extended period of time. Any such event could harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to attract new clients and students, cause existing clients to scale back their offerings or elect not to renew their agreements, cause prospective students not to enroll or existing students to not stay enrolled in our offerings, or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability. Further, any reputational damage resulting from breach of our security measures could create distrust of our company by prospective clients or students. In addition, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover losses associated with such events, and in any case, such insurance may not cover all costs, expenses or losses we could incur to respond to and remediate a security breach. As a result, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of these disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such disruptions or breaches. 
 Data protection laws in jurisdictions around the world require companies and institutions to notify impacted individuals of certain data breach incidents, usually in writing. Under the terms of our contracts with our university clients, we would be responsible for the costs of investigating and disclosing data breaches to the university clients students, if required by law. In addition to costs associated with investigating, disclosing, and remediating a data breach, we could be required to compensate victims by providing identity protection or monitoring services. We also could be subject to substantial monetary fines or private claims by affected parties and our reputation would likely be harmed.

Disruption to or failures of our online learning platforms could reduce university client and student satisfaction with our offerings and could harm our reputation. 
 The performance and reliability of our online learning platforms is critical to our operations, reputation and ability to attract new university clients, as well as our student acquisition and retention efforts. Our university clients rely on our platforms to provide their offerings online, and students access our platforms on a frequent basis as an important part of their educational experience. Because our platforms are complex and incorporates a variety of hardware and proprietary and third-party software, our platforms may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our university clients and students. Web- and mobile- based applications frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released, and we have from time to time found errors and defects in our technology and new errors and defects may be detected in the future. In addition, we have experienced and may in the future experience temporary system interruptions to our platforms for a variety of reasons, including network failures, power failures, problems with third-party firmware and software updates, as well as an overwhelming number of users trying to access our platforms. Any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our platforms could damage our or our university clients reputations, decrease student satisfaction and retention and impact our ability to attract new students and university clients. If any of these problems occur, our university clients could attempt to terminate their agreements with us or make indemnification or other claims against us. In addition, sustained or recurring disruptions in our platforms could adversely affect our and our university clients compliance with applicable regulations and accrediting body standards. 
 We rely upon Amazon Web Services to host certain aspects of our platform and any disruption of or interference with our use of Amazon Web Services could impair our ability to deliver our platform to clients and students, resulting in client and student dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation, and harm to our business. 
 Our online learning platform and certain of our other technology and services are hosted on data centers provided by Amazon Web Services, or AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud provider, any disruption of, or interference with our use of, AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted. AWS may terminate its agreement with us upon 30 days notice. Additionally, AWS has the right to terminate the agreement immediately with notice to us in certain scenarios, such as if AWS believes providing the services could create a substantial economic or technical burden or material security risk for AWS, or in order to comply with the law or requests of governmental entities. If any of our arrangements with AWS is terminated, we could experience interruptions in our platform as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging new facilities and services. 
 Our operations depend, in part, on AWS s abilities to protect their data center hosting facilities against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, criminal acts and similar events. The occurrence of spikes in usage volume, a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, vandalism or sabotage, a decision to close a facility without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems at a facility could result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of our platform, which would result in harm to our business. In the event of a system failure, the backup systems and disaster recovery services provided by AWS may be insufficient or fail. Also, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. These factors in turn could further reduce our revenue, subject us to liability or cause our clients to fail to renew or terminate their contracts, any of which could harm our business. 
 Our internal information technology systems are critical to our business. System integration and implementation issues could disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business or result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls. 
 We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems, including systems for billing, human resources, enterprise resource planning, and customer relationship management. As our business has grown in size and complexity, the growth has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our internal information technology systems. To effectively manage this growth, we must commit significant financial resources and personnel to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop or acquire new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in our business and information-processing technology as well as evolving industry, regulatory, and accounting standards. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses is determined to be inaccurate or unreliable, or if we fail to properly maintain or enhance our internal information technology systems, we could have operational disruptions, significant deficiencies, or material weaknesses in our internal controls, incur increased operating and administrative expenses, lose our ability to produce timely and accurate financial reports, or suffer other adverse consequences.

If the mobile solutions available to our students and clients are not effective, the use of our platform could decline. 
 Students have been increasingly accessing our offerings and marketplace on mobile devices through our mobile applications in recent years. The smaller screen size and reduced functionality associated with some mobile devices may make the use of our platform more difficult or our clients may believe that online learning through such mobile devices is not effective. If we are not able to provide our clients with the functionality to deliver a rewarding experience on mobile devices, our ability to attract students to our offerings may be harmed and, consequently, our business may suffer. 
 As new mobile devices and mobile features are released, we may encounter problems in developing or supporting apps for them. In addition, supporting new devices and mobile device operating systems may require substantial time and resources. 
 The success of our mobile apps could also be harmed by factors outside our control, such as: 
 actions taken by mobile app distributors; 
 unfavorable treatment received by our mobile apps, especially as compared to competing apps, such as the placement of our mobile apps in a mobile app download store; 
 increased costs in the distribution and use of our mobile apps; or 
 changes in mobile operating systems, such as iOS and Android, that degrade functionality of our mobile website or mobile apps or that give preferential treatment to competitive offerings. 
 If our clients or students encounter difficulty accessing or using, or if they choose not to use, our mobile platform, our growth prospects and our business may be adversely affected. 
 If we fail to manage our growth or changes to our business operations effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service or address competitive challenges adequately. 
 We have experienced rapid growth and changes to our business operations in a relatively short period of time, which has placed, and will continue to place, a significant strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure and may require us to expand personnel on certain teams, as well as our facilities and infrastructure. We will also be required to refine our operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures. If we fail to manage our growth or changes in our business operations efficiently, our costs and expenses may increase more than we plan and we may not successfully expand our university client base, enhance our platform, develop new offerings with new and existing university clients, attract a sufficient number of students in a cost-effective manner, satisfy the requirements of our existing university clients, respond to competitive challenges or otherwise execute our business plan. 
 Our ability to manage any growth or changes in our business operations effectively will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to: 
 effectively recruit, integrate, train and motivate any new employees, while retaining existing employees; 
 maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture and effectively execute our business plan; 
 implement systems enhancements and continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls; 
 protect and further develop our strategic assets, including our intellectual property rights; and 
 make sound business decisions in light of the scrutiny associated with operating as a public company. 
 These activities will require significant capital expenditures and place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. 
 We may not be able to effectively manage any future growth in a cost-effective or timely manner, or at all, which could negatively affect the quality of our platform, our reputation, results of operations and overall business. 
 We may expand by acquiring or investing in other companies or technologies, which may divert our management s attention, result in dilution to our shareholders and consume resources that are necessary to sustain our business. 
 We have in the past acquired and may in the future acquire complementary products, services, technologies or businesses. Negotiating these transactions can be time-consuming, difficult and expensive, and our ability to complete these transactions may be subject to conditions or approvals that are beyond our control. In addition, we may not be able to identify desirable 
 22 

Table of Contents 

acquisition targets, may incorrectly estimate the value of an acquisition target or may not be successful in entering into an agreement with any particular target. Consequently, these transactions, even if undertaken and announced, may not close. 
 An acquisition, investment, or new business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, expenditures and integration challenges including the following: 
 diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns and performance; 
 managing a larger combined company; 
 maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees; 
 retaining existing business and operational relationships and attracting new business and operational relationships; 
 consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations and inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies; 
 coordinating geographically separate organizations; 
 unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; 
 undetected errors or unauthorized use of a third party s code in the products of the acquired companies or in the technology acquired; 
 breaches of our cybersecurity measures if there are cybersecurity issues we are not aware of at the time of the acquisition; 
 entry into highly competitive markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors have stronger market positions; and 
 exposure to unknown liabilities, including claims and disputes by third parties against the companies we acquire. 
 Many of these factors will be outside of the combined company s control and any one of them could result in delays, increased costs, decreased revenue and diversion of management s time and energy, which could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 If we experience difficulties with the integration process following an acquisition, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Moreover, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment, or business relationship may not be realized. 
 In addition, in connection with an acquisition, investment or new business relationship we may: 
 issue additional equity securities that would dilute current shareholders; 
 use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business; 
 incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay or that may place burdensome restrictions on our operations; 
 incur large charges or substantial liabilities; or 
 become subject to adverse tax consequences. 
 Any of these outcomes could harm our business and operating results. In addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we have acquired and may acquire in the future may be allocated to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. If our acquisitions do not ultimately yield expected returns, we may be required to make changes to our operating results based on our impairment assessment process. For example, during the three months ended March 31, 2022, we recorded impairment charges of 28.8 million and 30.0 million to goodwill and the indefinite-lived intangible asset, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded impairment charges of 50.2 million and 29.3 million to goodwill and the indefinite-lived intangible asset, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, our goodwill balance was 734.6 million and indefinite-lived intangible asset balance was 195.7 million, a significant portion of which relate to the acquisition of edX completed in November 2021 (the edX Acquisition ).

We face competition from established and emerging companies, which could divert clients or students to our competitors, result in pricing pressure and significantly reduce our revenue. 
 We expect that the online learning market will continue to expand and that the number of degree and non-degree offerings available online will proliferate. 
 In the Degree Program Segment, the number of new competitive entrants into the online learning market has expanded rapidly in recent years. As the number of online degree programs expands, we face increasing competition to enroll students in our offerings. This expansion has also resulted in an increase in the number of regional online degree program offerings for potential students. In addition to making enrollment decisions based on factors such as program quality and university brand strength, we have observed potential students giving preference to universities located in their region, which has further impacted the competitive landscape in our Degree Program Segment. 
 In our Alternative Credential Segment, which has a lower barrier to entry, we face increasing competition from other providers of massive open online courses, which directly compete with our open course offerings, but have also expanded their offerings to include certificate offerings, nano-degrees and similar non-degree alternatives. We also face competition from companies that provide corporate training programs and online courses taught outside the university environment (e.g., by experts in various fields). 
 We expect existing competitors and new entrants to the online learning market to revise and improve their business models constantly in response to challenges from competing businesses, including ours. If these or other market participants introduce new or improved delivery of online education and technology-enabled services that we cannot match or exceed in a timely or cost-effective manner, our ability to grow our revenue and achieve profitability could be compromised. 
 Some of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do. Increased competition may result in pricing pressure for us in terms of the percentage of tuition and fees we are able to negotiate to receive. The competitive landscape may also result in longer and more complex sales cycles with a prospective university client or a decrease in our market share among select nonprofit colleges and universities seeking to offer online educational offerings, any of which could negatively affect our revenue and future operating results and our ability to grow our business. 
 A number of competitive factors could cause us to lose potential client and student opportunities or force us to offer our platform on less favorable economic terms, including: 
 competitors may develop service offerings that our potential clients or students find to be more compelling than ours; 
 competitors may adopt more aggressive pricing policies and offer more attractive sales terms, adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in client and student requirements, and devote greater resources to the acquisition of students than we can; 
 current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products and expand their markets, and our industry is likely to see an increasing number of new entrants and increased consolidation. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share; and 
 colleges and universities may choose to continue using or to develop their own online learning solutions in-house, rather than pay for our platform. 
 We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. In addition, competition may intensify as our competitors raise additional capital and as established companies in other market segments or geographic markets expand into our market segments or geographic markets. If we cannot compete successfully against our competitors, our ability to grow our business and achieve profitability could be impaired. 
 If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our reputation and business may suffer. 
 We believe that maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand recognition is important to attract and retain students and clients, and that the importance of our reputation and brand recognition will continue to increase as competition in the markets in which we operate continues to develop. Our success in this arena will depend on a range of factors, both within and beyond our control. The following factors, many of which are beyond our control, may affect our reputation and brand recognition: 
 our ability to market our platform effectively and efficiently; 
 our ability to maintain a useful, innovative, and reliable platform; 
 24 

Table of Contents 

our ability to maintain a high satisfaction among students and partners; 
 our ability to provide high quality, valuable content for our platform; 
 our ability to successfully differentiate our platform from competing offerings; 
 our ability to maintain a consistently high level of customer service; 
 our ability to prevent any actual or perceived data security breach or incident or data loss, or misuse or perceived misuse of our platform; 
 the actions of competitors or other third parties; 
 positive or negative publicity, including with respect to events or activities attributed to us, our employees or our clients; 
 interruptions, delays, or attacks on our platform; and 
 litigation or legal developments. 
 Damage to our reputation and brand, from the factors listed above or otherwise, may reduce demand for our platform and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Moreover, any attempts to rehabilitate our reputation and brand recognition may be costly and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that any such efforts will ultimately be successful. 
 If for-profit postsecondary institutions, which offer online education alternatives different from ours, or online program management providers perform poorly or continue to attract negative publicity, it could tarnish our reputation or the reputation of online education as a whole, which could impair our ability to grow our business. 
 For-profit postsecondary institutions, many of which provide course offerings predominantly online, remain under intense regulatory and other scrutiny, which has led to media attention that has portrayed that sector in an unflattering light. Some for-profit online school operators have been subject to governmental investigations alleging the misuse of public funds, financial irregularities, exaggerated promises to students, and failure to achieve positive outcomes for students, including the inability to obtain employment in their fields. These allegations have attracted significant adverse media coverage and have prompted ongoing legislative hearings and actions as well as regulatory responses at both the state and federal level. These investigations have focused on specific companies and individuals, and the entire industry in the case of marketing and recruiting practices by for-profit higher education companies. Even though we do not market our platform to for-profit institutions, and have a different business model from them, this negative media attention has nevertheless fostered skepticism about online program management companies, online higher education generally and our company specifically. Allegations of abuse of federal financial aid funds and other statutory violations against higher education companies, even if unfounded, could negatively impact our opportunity to succeed due to increased regulation or decreased demand for our offerings. Our company has been the subject of articles and inquiries by critics of for-profit education models generally, and such critics continue to advocate for changes in law and regulation at the state and federal level that would be adverse to our business model and have sought information and increased oversight regarding the business practices of online program management companies. For example, such critics have sometimes compared our business to that of entities that were formally for-profit institutions and that subsequently converted to non-profit status, and the conflation of these newer business models with our own likely increased scrutiny of our business by Congress, DOE or other regulatory agencies. Any of these factors could negatively impact our ability to increase our university client base and grow our offerings and our revenue, which would make it difficult to continue to grow our business. 
 If we do not retain our senior management team and key employees, we may not be able to sustain our growth or achieve our business objectives. 
 Our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management team. In this respect, our senior management team is heavily involved in the university client identification and sales process, and their expertise is critical in navigating the complex approval processes of large nonprofit colleges and universities. We do not maintain key-person insurance on any of our employees, including our senior management team. The loss of the services of any individual on our senior management team, or failure to find a suitable successor, could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. 
 Our future success also depends heavily on the retention of our marketing and sales, technology and content development and support teams to continue to attract and retain students, thereby generating revenue for us. In particular, our highly-skilled technology and content development employees provide the technical expertise underlying our technology and technology- 
 25 

Table of Contents 

enabled services that support our university clients offerings and the students enrolled in these offerings. We have experienced intense competition for these employees, and we may be unable to attract or retain these key personnel that are critical to our success, resulting in harm to our relationships with university clients, loss of expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. 
 In addition, as a result of business acquisitions and our Strategic Realignment Plan, our current and prospective employees and employees of any acquired company may experience uncertainty about their future roles following the acquisition or announcement of the Strategic Realignment Plan. If our employees or the employees of any acquired company depart because of issues relating to uncertainty or perceived difficulties of integration, our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition could be adversely impacted. 
 We have employees outside of the United States, have international residents that apply to and enroll in our offerings and plan to expand our international business, which exposes us to risks inherent in international operations. 
 Since 2017, and more recently as a result of the edX Acquisition, we have significantly increased our international operations, including the number of international applicants and students in our offerings. One element of our growth strategy is to continue expanding our international operations and to continue expanding our global student and client base. Our current international operations and future initiatives will involve a variety of risks that could constrain our operations and compromise our growth prospects, including: 
 the need to localize and adapt online offerings for specific countries, including translation into foreign languages and ensuring that these offerings enable our university clients to comply with local education laws and regulations; 
 difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including different pricing environments, longer sales cycles, longer accounts receivable payment cycles and collections issues; 
 lack of familiarity with and unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements; 
 challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs; 
 new and different sources of competition, and practices which may favor local competitors; 
 weaker protection for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the United States and practical difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and other rights outside of the United States; 
 compliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including labor and employment, tax, education, privacy and data protection, and anti-bribery laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act; 
 increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; 
 restrictions on the transfer of funds; 
 adverse tax consequences, including liabilities for indirect taxes or the potential for required withholding taxes for our overseas employees; 
 terrorist attacks, public health crises, acts of violence or war and adverse environmental conditions; 
 unstable regional, economic or political conditions; and 
 fluctuations in currency exchange rates or restrictions on foreign currency and resulting effects on our revenue and expenses. 
 Our expansion efforts may not be successful. Our experience with attracting university clients and students in the U.S. may not be relevant to our ability to attract clients and students in other markets. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to attract university clients and students successfully and in a timely manner, our business and operating results will be harmed.

Our operations in South Africa expose us to risks that could have an adverse effect on our business. 
 We have a significant employee base in South Africa. We may incur costs complying with labor laws, rules and regulations in South Africa, including laws that regulate work time, provide for mandatory compensation in the event of termination of employment for operational reasons, and impose monetary penalties for non-compliance with administrative and reporting requirements in respect of affirmative action policies. Our reliance on a workforce in South Africa also exposes us to disruptions in the business, political, and economic environment in that region, as well as natural disasters, public health crises, power outages and other environmental conditions. Maintenance of a stable political environment is important to our operations in South Africa, and terrorist attacks and acts of violence or war may directly affect our physical facilities and workforce or contribute to general instability. Our operations in South Africa require us to comply with complex local laws and regulatory requirements and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. The economy of South Africa in the past has been, and in the future may continue to be, characterized by rates of inflation and interest rates that are substantially higher than those prevailing in the United States, which could increase our South-African-based costs and decrease our operating margins. Our operations in South Africa may also subject us to trade restrictions, exchange control limitations, reduced or inadequate protection for intellectual property rights, security breaches, and other factors that may adversely affect our business. Negative developments in any of these areas could increase our costs of operations or otherwise harm our business. 
 We engage some individuals classified as independent contractors, not employees, and if U.S. or international regulatory authorities mandate that they be classified as employees, our business would be adversely impacted. 
 We engage independent contractors and are subject to U.S. and international regulations and guidelines regarding independent contractor classification. These regulations and guidelines are subject to judicial and agency interpretation, and it could be determined that our current or former independent contractor classifications are inapplicable. Further, if legal standards for classification of independent contractors change, it may be necessary to modify our compensation structure for these personnel, including by paying additional compensation or reimbursing expenses. In addition, if our independent contractors are determined to have been misclassified as independent contractors, we would incur additional exposure under U.S. and international law, workers compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings. Any of these outcomes could result in substantial costs to us, could significantly impair our financial condition and our ability to conduct our business as we choose, and could damage our reputation and our ability to attract and retain other personnel. 
 We rely on certain third-party providers of software and services integral to the operations of our business. 
 We rely on software that we license from third parties and services provided by third parties to offer certain components of our technology and services. In addition, we may need to obtain future licenses or services from third parties necessary for the continued provision of our technology and services, which might not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If our agreements with third-party software or services vendors are not renewed or the third-party software or services become obsolete, fail to function properly, are defective or otherwise fail to provide quality service or address our or our clients needs, there is no assurance that we would be able to replace the functionality provided by the third-party software or service provider with software or services from alternative providers. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. 
 Implementation of our 2022 Strategic Realignment Plan may not be successful, which could affect our ability to increase our profitability. 
 On July 28, 2022, we announced a plan to accelerate our transition to a platform company (the 2022 Strategic Realignment Plan ). The plan was designed to reorient the company around a single platform allowing us to pursue a portfolio-based marketing strategy that drives traffic to the edX marketplace. As part of the plan, the Company optimized marketing spend, simplified its executive structure to reduce silos, reduced employee headcount, and rationalized its real estate footprint. We expect to record in the aggregate approximately 35 million to 40 million in restructuring charges associated with the 2022 Strategic Realignment Plan. The plan was substantially completed by December 31, 2022 with cash expenditures relating to the employee headcount reduction continuing through the first quarter of 2024 and cash expenditures related to real estate continuing through the duration of lease terms ranging from 1 to 9 years. Although we believe that the 2022 Strategic Realignment Plan will reduce overhead costs, enhance operational efficiency, and result in improved profitability, we cannot guarantee that the 2022 Strategic Realignment Plan will achieve or sustain the expected benefits, or that the benefits, even if achieved, will be adequate to meet our long-term profitability and operational expectations. Risks associated with the impact of the 2022 Strategic Realignment Plan also include additional unexpected costs and negative impacts on our cash flows from operations and liquidity, employee attrition beyond our intended reductions and adverse effects on employee morale, diversion of management attention, adverse effects to our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficult for us to hire and retain employees in the future, and potential failure or delays to meet operational and growth targets due to the loss of qualified employees and the potential negative impact on our reputation among our university clients. If we do not realize the expected

benefits or synergies of the 2022 Strategic Realignment Plan, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be negatively impacted. 
 If students do not expand beyond the free offerings available on our platform, our ability to grow our business and improve our results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 Many of our students initially access the free or audit track of the open courses available on our platform. Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to increase the number of registered learners on our platform and to persuade those learners to enroll in the paid certificate track of the open courses available on our platform or in one of our paid offerings. If students do not expand beyond free offerings, our ability to grow our business may be adversely affected. 
 Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Capital Structure 
 Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk and prevent us from meeting our obligations with respect to our indebtedness. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 953.8 million of indebtedness on a consolidated basis, including 380 million of 2.25 Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes issued pursuant to an indenture between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association (the 2025 Indenture ). Additionally, on January 11, 2023, we issued 147 million of 4.50 Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes due 2030 (the 2030 Notes and together with the 2025 Notes, the Convertible Notes pursuant to an indenture between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association (the 2030 Indenture and together with the 2025 Indenture, the Indentures ), and amended, extended and paid down the Term Loan Credit and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of June 28, 2021, by entering into the Extension Amendment, Second Amendment and First Incremental Agreement to Credit and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of January 9, 2023 (the Second Amended Credit Agreement reducing the amount of term loans outstanding under such instrument to 380 million and adding a revolving credit facility in an amount not to exceed 40 million. See Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could: 
 limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and other general corporate purposes; 
 require a substantial portion of our cash from operating activities to be dedicated to debt service payments and reduce the amount of cash available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; 
 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to certain of our competitors who have less debt; 
 hinder our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions; 
 limit our ability to secure adequate bank financing in the future with reasonable terms and conditions; and 
 increase our vulnerability to, and limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to, a potential downturn in general economic conditions or in one or more of our businesses. 
 The Indentures and the Second Amended Credit Agreement contain, and the agreements governing indebtedness we may incur in the future may contain, affirmative and negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt. 
 Despite current indebtedness levels and existing restrictive covenants, we may still incur additional indebtedness that could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial financial leverage. 
 We may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future under the agreements governing our indebtedness. We are subject to limited restriction under the terms of the Indentures from incurring additional unsecured debt. Although the Second Amended Credit Agreement contains, and any future indebtedness may contain, restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of thresholds, qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Additionally, these restrictions could permit us to incur obligations that, although preferential to our common stock in terms of payment, do not constitute indebtedness.

The Second Amended Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that may limit our operational flexibility. 
 The Second Amended Credit Agreement requires us to comply with several financial covenants and other restrictive covenants, such as maintaining minimum recurring revenues, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio and a maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio, maintaining insurance coverage, and restricting our ability to make certain investments. In addition, the 2030 Notes also contain financial covenants consistent with the Second Amended Credit Agreement. Compliance with these covenants may limit our ability to engage in new lines of business, make certain investments, pay dividends, or enter into various transactions. 
 These covenants may limit the flexibility of our operations, and lack of compliance could result in a default under the Second Amended Credit Agreement. If such a default were to occur, the lenders would have the right to terminate their commitments to provide loans under the Second Amended Credit Agreement and declare any and all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, the lenders would have the right to proceed against the collateral in which we granted a first priority security interest to them, which consists of substantially all our assets. Additionally, the scheduled maturity date of the loans under the Second Amended Credit Agreement may be accelerated to (i) in the case of the term loan facility, January 30, 2025 in the event more than 40 million of 2025 Notes remain outstanding on such date and (ii) in the case of the revolving facility, January 1, 2025, in the event more than 50 million of 2025 Notes remain outstanding on such date. If the debt under the Second Amended Credit Agreement were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the debt or sell sufficient assets to repay the debt, including the Convertible Notes which have cross-acceleration provisions to the Second Amended Credit Agreement, which could immediately materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Furthermore, the Second Amended Credit Agreement restricts, and any future indebtedness may similarly restrict or prohibit, us from making any cash payments to settle a conversion, repurchase, mandatory redemption or maturity payment in respect of the Convertible Notes. Our inability to make cash payments upon the conversion or repurchase of the Convertible Notes could result in dilution to our stockholders and limit our operational flexibility, respectively, and, in respect of a payment in connection with a mandatory redemption or maturity, would permit holders of the Convertible Notes to accelerate our obligations under the Convertible Notes. In addition, any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital or make payments under our other indebtedness. If we fail to comply with such covenants or to make payments under our indebtedness when due, then we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. 
 To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. 
 Our ability to make cash payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend upon our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. 
 If we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operating activities or are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or amounts payable upon maturity or a mandatory redemption of the Convertible Notes, or if we fail to comply with the various covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness and we are unable to obtain waivers from the required lenders or noteholders, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of our indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. As a result, we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. 
 We may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Convertible Notes for cash following a fundamental change, or to pay any cash amounts due upon conversion, and our other indebtedness may limit our ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes or pay cash upon their conversion. 
 Holders of the Convertible Notes may, subject to certain exceptions, require us to repurchase their Convertible Notes following a fundamental change (as defined in the applicable Indenture) at a cash repurchase price generally equal to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion, we will satisfy part or all of our conversion obligations in cash unless we elect to settle conversions solely in shares of our common stock. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase the Convertible Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. In addition, applicable law, regulatory authorities and the agreements governing our other indebtedness may restrict our ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. Our failure to repurchase Convertible Notes or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion when required will constitute a default under the Indentures. A default under the Indentures or the fundamental 
 29 

Table of Contents 

change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our other indebtedness, which may result in that other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all amounts due under the other indebtedness and the Convertible Notes. 
 Conversion of the Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock. 
 The conversion of some or all of the Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon any conversion of the Convertible Notes. The make-whole conversion provisions under the Indentures governing the Convertible Notes may also further dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. In addition, the Indentures governing the Convertible Notes provide for customary anti-dilution provisions, which may result in the issuance of additional shares of our common stock. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Convertible Notes could be used to satisfy short positions. The anticipated conversion of the Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock could also depress the price of our common stock. 
 Provisions in the Convertible Notes, Indentures and in the Second Amended Credit Agreement could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover of us. 
 Certain provisions in the Convertible Notes and in the Indentures could make a third-party attempt to acquire us more difficult or expensive. For example, if a takeover constitutes a fundamental change (as defined in the applicable Indenture), then noteholders will have the right to require us to repurchase their Convertible Notes for cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the applicable Indenture), then we may be required to temporarily increase the conversion rate. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the Convertible Notes and the Indentures, as well as the Second Amended Credit Agreement, under which a change of control is an event of default resulting in acceleration of all indebtedness thereunder, could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, including in a transaction that noteholders or holders of our common stock may view as favorable. 
 The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Convertible Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results. 
 In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contract in an Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) ASU 2020-06 ), which amends the accounting standards for convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion. ASU 2020-06 eliminates requirements to separately account for liability and equity components of such convertible debt instruments and eliminates the ability to use the treasury stock method for calculating diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments whose principal amount may be settled using shares. Instead, ASU 2020-06 requires (i) the entire amount of the security to be presented as a liability on the balance sheet and (ii) application of the if-converted method for calculating diluted earnings per share. Under the if-converted method, diluted earnings per share will generally be calculated assuming that all the Convertible Notes were converted solely into shares of common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive, which could adversely affect our diluted earnings per share. 
 We adopted ASU 2020-06 in the first quarter of 2022, using the modified retrospective basis, effective as of January 1, 2022. Following adoption of this ASU, we no longer separate the liability and equity components of the Convertible Notes on our balance sheet. 
 The capped call transactions may affect the value of our common stock. 
 In connection with the 2025 Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of the 2025 Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2025 Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. 
 The option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions from time to time (and are likely to do so following any conversion of the 2025 Notes, any repurchase of the 2025 Notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date, any redemption date or any other date on which the 2025 Notes are retired by us, in each case, if we exercise our option to terminate the relevant portion of the capped call transactions). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock. 
 30 

Table of Contents 

In addition, if any such capped call transactions are terminated for any reason, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may unwind their hedge positions with respect to our common stock, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. 
 Furthermore, the option counterparties are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the capped call transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Past global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of a number of financial institutions. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the capped call transactions with such option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties. 
 We might not be able to utilize a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards, which could adversely affect our profitability. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses, which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2029. Our gross state net operating loss carryforwards are equal to or less than the federal net operating loss carryforwards and expire over various periods based on individual state tax laws. These net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our profitability. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, which is generally defined as a greater than 50 change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, we determined that such an ownership change occurred. Absent a subsequent ownership change, however, all of our historical net operating losses should be available. Therefore, the occurrence of the ownership change during the three-year period ended December 31, 2016 is not expected to limit our ability to carry forward historical net operating losses before expiration. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. If a future ownership change occurs and limits our ability to use our historical net operating loss carryforwards, it would harm our future financial statement results by increasing our future tax obligations. We also have net operating loss carryforwards in South Africa and the United Kingdom and there is no guarantee that entities in these countries will generate enough taxable income to fully utilize them. 
 We may need additional capital in the future to pursue our business objectives. Additional capital may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, which could compromise our ability to grow our business. 
 We may need to raise additional funds to respond to business challenges or opportunities, accelerate our growth, develop new offerings or enhance our platform. Our continued access to sources of liquidity depends on multiple factors, including global economic conditions, the condition of global financial markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing and our operating performance, all of which may be impacted by the recent growth in inflation. If we seek to raise additional capital, it may not be available on favorable terms or may not be available at all. In addition, under our Second Amended Credit Agreement, we may be restricted from using the net proceeds of financing transactions for our operating objectives. Lack of sufficient capital resources could significantly limit our ability to manage our business and to take advantage of business and strategic opportunities. Additionally, if we fail to refinance our 2025 Notes (i) prior to January 30, 2025, then the maturity on the term loan facility under the Second Amended Credit Agreement will be accelerated, and (ii) prior to January 1, 2025, then the maturity on the revolving facility under the Second Amended Credit Agreement will be accelerated. Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity or debt securities with an equity component would dilute our stock ownership. If adequate additional funds are not available if and when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate material parts of our business strategy.

Risks Related to Regulation of Our Business and That of Our University Clients 
 Our business model relies on university client institutions complying with federal and state laws and regulations. 
 Higher education is heavily regulated. All of our university clients in the United States and certain university clients outside of the United States participate in Title IV federal student financial assistance programs under the HEA of 1965, as amended, or HEA, and are subject to extensive regulation by the DOE, as well as various state agencies, licensing boards and accrediting commissions. To participate in the Title IV programs, an institution must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agencies, be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by the DOE, and be certified by the DOE as an eligible institution. If a university client participating in Title IV was found to be in non-compliance with any of these laws, regulations, standards or policies, the university client could lose some or all of its access to Title IV program funds, lose the ability to offer certain programs or lose its ability to operate in certain states, any of which could cause our revenue from that university client s program to decline. 
 The regulations, standards, guidance and policies applicable to our university clients change frequently and are often subject to interpretation. Changes in, or new interpretations of, applicable laws, regulations, guidance or standards could compromise our university clients accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, permissible activities or use of federal funds under Title IV programs. We cannot predict with certainty how the requirements applied by our university clients regulators will be interpreted, or whether our university clients will be able to comply with these requirements in the future. 
 Certain requirements of Title II and Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act apply to us and our university clients and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1974 applies to our university clients that receive federal funding. Further, in the absence of definitive federal rulemaking, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1, a set of recommendations and technical standards for making websites accessible to individuals with disabilities published by the World Wide Web Consortium, have become the effective standard for learner-facing aspects of our platform. We may not be successful in ensuring that our offerings and services comply with these changing statutory and regulatory requirements, which could make our solutions less attractive to our clients and students, and we expect to incur ongoing costs of compliance. 
 Our activities are subject to federal and state laws and regulations and other requirements. 
 Although we are not an institution of higher education, we are required to comply with certain education laws and regulations as a result of our role as a service provider to higher education institutions, either directly or indirectly through our contractual arrangements with university clients. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in breach of contract and indemnification claims and could cause damage to our reputation and impair our ability to grow our business and achieve profitability. 
 Activities of the U.S. Congress or Department of Education could result in adverse legislation or regulatory actions or investigations. 
 The process of reauthorization of the HEA is expected to continue until the HEA is updated. Congressional hearings may be scheduled by the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and the Workforce and other Congressional committees regarding various aspects of the education industry, including accreditation matters, student debt, student recruiting, cost of tuition, distance learning, competency-based learning, student success and outcomes and other matters. Future hearings may include a discussion of the role of online program management companies. 
 The increased scrutiny and results-based accountability initiatives in the education sector, as well as ongoing policy differences in Congress regarding spending levels and other issues, could lead to significant changes in connection with the reauthorization of the HEA or otherwise. These changes may result in new or additional regulatory burdens on postsecondary schools generally, and specific initiatives may be targeted at or have an impact upon companies like us that serve higher education. The adoption of any laws or regulations that limit our ability to provide our services to our university clients could compromise our ability to drive revenue through their programs or make our platform less attractive to them. Congress could also enact laws, authorize regulations or revise guidance that requires us to modify our practices in ways that could increase our costs or decrease our revenues. 
 In addition, ongoing regulatory activities and initiatives of the DOE may have similar consequences for our business even in the absence of Congressional action. For example, DOE completed new rulemaking processes in 2022 that may impact our partners. While the most recent regulatory changes do not impact our business model, DOE has released a new rulemaking agenda, issued new guidance and indicated it intends to consider future regulatory and guidance changes in 2023, some of which may impact us or our partners. We cannot predict with certainty what these future changes will be, or whether they will lead to any additional reports that may impact our business in the future.

Our business model, which depends on our ability to receive a share of tuition revenue as payment from our university clients, has been validated by a DOE dear colleague letter, but such validation is not codified by statute or regulation and may be subject to change. 
 Each institution that participates in Title IV programs agrees it will not provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based in any part, directly or indirectly, upon success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid, to any person or entity who is engaged in any student recruitment or admission activity, or in making decisions regarding the award of Title IV, HEA program funds. Virtually all of our university clients participate in Title IV Programs. 
 Although this rule, referred to as the incentive compensation rule, generally prohibits entities or individuals from receiving incentive-based compensation payments for the successful recruitment, admission or enrollment of students, the DOE provided official policy guidance in 2011 permitting tuition revenue-sharing arrangements known as the bundled services rule. Our current business model relies in part on the bundled services rule to enter into tuition revenue-sharing agreements with our university clients. 
 Because the bundled services rule was promulgated in the form of agency guidance issued by the DOE in the form of a dear colleague letter, or DCL, and is not codified by statute or regulation, there is risk that the rule could be altered or removed without customary administrative procedural requirements, such as adequate prior notice, that accompany formal agency rulemaking. Although the DCL remains the longstanding policy, the DOE has provided notice that they intend to review the bundled services rule in March 2023 with the intent to improve the guidance on the incentive compensation rule with respect to bundled services. 
 In addition, the legal weight the DCL would carry in any litigation over the propriety of any specific compensation or revenue sharing arrangements under the HEA or the incentive compensation rule is uncertain. We can offer no assurances as to how the DCL would be interpreted by a court. The revision, removal or invalidation of the bundled services rule by Congress, the DOE or a court, whether in an action involving our company or our university clients, or in an action that does not involve us, could require us to change our business model and renegotiate the terms of many of our university client contracts and could compromise our ability to generate revenue or otherwise adversely impact our business. 
 If we or our subcontractors or agents violate the incentive compensation rule, we could be liable to our university clients for substantial fines, sanctions or other liabilities. 
 Even though the DCL issued in 2011 clarifies that tuition revenue-sharing arrangements with our university clients are permissible, we are still subject to other provisions of the incentive compensation rule that prohibit us from offering to our employees who are involved with or responsible for recruiting or admissions activities any bonus or incentive-based compensation based on the successful identification, admission or enrollment of students into any institution. If we or our subcontractors or agents violate the incentive compensation rule, we could be liable to our university clients for substantial fines, sanctions or other liabilities, including liabilities related to whistleblower claims under the federal False Claims Act. Any such claims, even if without merit, could require us to incur significant costs to defend the claim, distract management s attention and damage our reputation. 
 If we or our university clients fail to meet DOE s third party servicer requirements, we may incur liabilities, or be fined, limited, suspended or terminated from participating as a third-party servicer of Title IV programs. 
 The DOE has issued revised guidance indicating that entities like ours performing the functions of student recruiting and retention, the provision of software products and services involving Title IV administration activities, and the provision of educational content and instruction, among other things, are now deemed third-party servicers . Institutions of higher education that contract with third party servicers are subject to reporting requirements with respect to such entities, and the entities themselves are subject to annual audits of the Title IV-relevant functions they perform, if such functions are covered by the DOE audit guide then in effect. If the DOE determines that a third party servicer has not met DOE regulations or has violated its fiduciary duty, the DOE may fine the third-party servicer or limit, suspend or terminate the third party servicer s participation in Title IV programs. In addition, third party servicers and their institutional partners are jointly and severally liable for violating Title IV requirements. 
 If we or our subcontractors or agents violate the misrepresentation rule, or similar international, federal and state regulatory requirements, we could face fines, sanctions and other liabilities. 
 We are required to comply with other regulations promulgated by the DOE that affect our student acquisition activities, including the misrepresentation rule. The misrepresentation rule is broad in scope and applies to statements our employees, subcontractors or agents may make about the nature of a university client s program, a university client s financial charges or the employability of a university client s program graduates. A violation of this rule, FTC rules or other international, federal or state regulations applicable to our marketing activities by our university client, an employee,

Table of Contents 

subcontractor or agent performing services for clients could lead to governmental investigations and sanctions, hurt our reputation, result in the termination of university client contracts, require us to pay fines or other monetary penalties or require us to pay the costs associated with indemnifying a university client from private claims or government investigations. 
 If our university clients fail to maintain their state authorizations, or we or our university clients violate other state laws and regulations, students in their offerings could be adversely affected and we could lose our ability to operate in that state and provide services to these university clients. 
 Our university clients must be authorized in certain states to offer online educational offerings, engage in recruiting and operate externships, internships, clinical training or other forms of field experience, depending on state law. The loss of or failure to obtain state authorization would, among other things, limit the ability of a university client to enroll students in that state, render the university client and its students ineligible to participate in Title IV programs in that state, diminish the attractiveness of the university client s offering and ultimately compromise our ability to generate revenue and become profitable. 
 In addition, if we or any of our university clients fail to comply with any state agency s rules, regulations or standards beyond authorizations, the state agency or state attorney general could limit the ability of the university client to offer educational offerings in that state or limit our ability to perform our contractual obligations to our university client in that state. 
 If our university clients fail to maintain institutional or programmatic accreditation for their offerings, our revenue could be materially affected. 
 The loss or suspension of a university client s accreditation or other adverse action by the university client s institutional or programmatic accreditor would render the institution or its offerings ineligible to participate in Title IV programs, could prevent the university client from offering certain educational offerings and, for certain degree-granting programs, could make it impossible for the graduates of the university client s program to obtain employment in the profession for which they trained. If any of these results occurs, it could hurt our ability to generate revenue from that offering. 
 Our future growth could be impaired if our university clients fail to obtain timely approval from applicable regulatory agencies to offer new programs, make substantive changes to existing programs or expand their programs into or within certain states. 
 Our university clients are required to obtain the appropriate approvals from the DOE and applicable state and accrediting regulatory agencies for new programs or locations, which may be conditioned, delayed or denied in a manner that could impair our strategic plans and future growth. Regulatory constraints have resulted in delays to various approvals our university clients are requesting, and such delays could in turn delay the timing of our ability to generate revenue from our university clients programs. 
 If more state agencies require specialized approval of our university clients offerings, our operating costs could increase significantly, approval times could lag, or we could be prohibited from operating in certain states. 
 In addition to state licensing agencies, our university clients may be required to obtain approval from professional licensing boards in certain states to offer specialized programs in specific fields of study. Currently, relatively few states require institutions to obtain professional board approval for their online educational offerings. However, more states could pass laws requiring our university clients offerings, such as graduate programs in teaching or nursing, to obtain approval from state professional boards. If a significant number of states pass additional laws requiring schools to obtain professional board approval, the cost of obtaining all necessary state approvals could dramatically increase, which could make our platform less attractive to university clients, and these university clients could be barred from operating in some states entirely. 
 Evolving regulations and legal obligations related to data privacy, data protection and information security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations, could have an adverse effect on our business. 
 The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data security is rapidly evolving and likely is to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. In providing our platform to university clients and in operating our business, we collect and process regulated personal information from students, faculty, prospective students and employees. Our handling of this personal information is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, which have been adopted by federal, state and foreign governments to regulate the collection, distribution, use and storage of personal information. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with these data protection laws and regulations or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of this personal information in our possession, could result in government enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity, all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. 
 Various federal, state and foreign legislative, regulatory or other governmental bodies have adopted laws or regulations concerning privacy, security, data storage and data protection that could materially adversely impact our business. Moreover, 
 34

much of the personal information we collect and process is regulated by multiple privacy laws across various jurisdictions. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR ), which took effect in May 2018, introduced robust requirements for the protection of personal data of individuals in the European Union EU and substantial fines for non-compliance, including fines up to 4 of a Company s annual global revenue. However, with the withdrawal of the United Kingdom UK from the EU in 2020, we must also now comply with the local laws of that jurisdiction such as the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK General Data Protection Regulation. This introduces the risk of possible enforcement from a separate data protection authority, with its distinct power to impose substantial fines for non-compliance. As another example, in July 2020, South Africa s privacy law known as the Protection of Personal Information Act became effective, mandating new requirements for processing of personal information by entities domiciled in South Africa, and our Company must comply with these laws. 
 We are also subject to evolving EU rules on data transfer, as we may transfer personal data from the European Economic Area to other jurisdictions. The invalidation of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework in July 2020 and introduction of updated Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) in 2021 for alternative means of cross-border data transfer, results in additional complexity and risk to our compliance measures. 
 Moreover, other new regulations, such as the Digital Services Act, which entered into force in the UK on November 16, 2022, and California s Age Appropriate Design Code, passed in August 2022 and going into effect in July 2024, place additional obligations on online platforms and the ways in which they handle, share and disclose data. 
 In the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA took effect in January 2020. Pursuant to the CCPA, we are required, among other things, to meet certain enhanced notice requirements to California residents regarding our use or disclosure of their personal information, allow California residents to opt-out of certain uses and disclosures of their personal information without penalty, and provide Californians with other choices related to personal data in our possession. The California Attorney General may seek substantial monetary penalties and injunctive relief in the event of our non-compliance with the CCPA. The CCPA also allows for private lawsuits from Californians in the event of certain data breaches. The CCPA was amended by the California Privacy Rights Act CPRA ), which went into effect on January 1, 2023 (regulations pending). CPRA places additional obligations on covered businesses regarding consumer opt-out rights and use of sensitive data, among other requirements. Moreover, Virginia, Utah, Connecticut and Colorado all have passed new privacy laws that either went into effect in 2022 or will go into effect in 2023. Without an overarching federal law driving privacy compliance in the U.S., the risk is high of a patchwork of privacy legislation formed by individual state laws, similar to the states approach to breach notification obligations. This could not only increase costs for compliance but also raise the risk of enforcement by individual state attorneys general. 
 We also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations, rulings and industry standards concerning privacy, security, data storage and data protection in the U.S., the EU and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations, rulings and standards may have on our business. For example, the European ePrivacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC, as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC), which obliges EU member states to introduce certain national laws regulating privacy in the electronic communications sector, will soon be replaced by the ePrivacy Regulation. As the text of the ePrivacy Regulation is still under development and in draft form, and as further guidance is issued and interpretations of both the ePrivacy Regulation and the GDPR develop, it is difficult to assess the impact of either on our business or operations, but it may require us to modify our data practices and policies. In addition, in 2021 new privacy laws were passed in China, Brazil and other jurisdictions, and many countries are considering updates to their current data protection regulations, including Australia and India. 
 Complying with these and other changing requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs, or require us to change our business practices, any of which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results. 
 We are required to comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA, and failure to do so could harm our reputation and negatively affect our business. 
 FERPA generally prohibits an institution of higher education participating in Title IV programs from disclosing personally identifiable information from a student s education records without the student s consent. Our university clients and their students disclose to us certain information that originates from or comprises a student education record under FERPA. As an entity that provides services to institutions participating in Title IV programs, we are indirectly subject to FERPA, and we may not transfer or otherwise disclose any personally identifiable information from a student record to another party other than in a manner permitted under the statute. If we violate FERPA, it could result in a material breach of contract with one or more of our 
 35 

Table of Contents 

university clients and could harm our reputation. Further, in the event that we disclose student information in violation of FERPA, the DOE could require a university client to suspend our access to its student information for at least five years. 
 In our Alternative Credential Segment, we are subject to risks and compliance rules and regulations related to the third-party credit card payment processing platform integrated within our websites or otherwise used by our business. 
 Students typically use a credit or debit card to pay application and enrollment fees and to make tuition payments for the offerings in our Alternative Credential Segment that are not free. We are subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. We believe that we and the payment processing service providers we use are compliant in all material respects with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. However, there is no guarantee that such compliance will be maintained or that compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our systems that are integrated with our payment processing providers. If we or any of the third-party payment processors we use fail to be in compliance with applicable credit card rules and regulations, we may be required to migrate to an alternate payment processor which could result in transaction downtime during the migration and/or a loss of students and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We are subject to governmental export, import and sanctions controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. 
 Our business activities are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export and similar laws and regulations, including the U.S. Department of Commerce s Export Administration Regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. The U.S. export control laws and U.S. economic sanctions laws include restrictions or prohibitions on the sale of certain services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons, and entities. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain technology and have enacted or could enact laws that could limit our ability to provide students access to our platform or could limit our students ability to access or use our services in those countries. 
 Changes in our platform, or future changes in export and import regulations, may prevent our international students from utilizing our platform or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our platform to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions, or related legislation or changes in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our platform by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell subscriptions to our platform to, existing or potential students internationally. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial results. 
 Risks Related to Intellectual Property 
 We operate in an industry with extensive intellectual property litigation. Claims of infringement against us may hurt our business. 
 Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to avoid infringing intellectual property rights owned by others and being able to resolve claims of intellectual property infringement without major financial expenditures or adverse consequences. The technology and software fields generally are characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and many companies that own, or claim to own, intellectual property have aggressively asserted their rights. In addition, we face potential copyright and trademark infringement from the content we produce in connection with our marketing activities, including in websites related to our offerings. From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others, and we expect that third parties will assert intellectual property claims against us, particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business. In addition, our university client agreements require us to indemnify our university clients against claims that our platform infringes the intellectual property rights of third parties. 
 Future litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves or our university clients from intellectual property infringement claims or to establish our proprietary rights. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do and would be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could. In addition, patent holding companies that focus solely on extracting royalties and settlements by enforcing patent rights 
 36 

Table of Contents 

may target us. Regardless of whether claims that we are infringing patents or other intellectual property rights have any merit, these claims are time-consuming and costly to evaluate and defend and could: 
 hurt our reputation; 
 adversely affect our relationships with our current or future university clients; 
 cause delays or stoppages in providing our platform; 
 divert management s attention and resources; 
 require technology changes to our software that could cause us to incur substantial cost; 
 subject us to significant liabilities; and 
 require us to cease some or all of our activities. 
 In addition to liability for monetary damages against us, which may include attorneys fees, treble damages in the event of a finding of willful infringement, or, in some circumstances, damages against our university clients, we may be prohibited from developing, commercializing or continuing to provide some or all of our bundled technology-enabled platform unless we obtain licenses from, and pay royalties to, the holders of the patents or other intellectual property rights, which may not be available on commercially favorable terms, or at all. 
 We may incur liability, or our reputation may be harmed, as a result of the activities of our university clients and students or the content in our online learning platforms. 
 We may be subject to potential liability for the activities of our university clients or students in connection with the data they post or store in our online learning platforms. For example, university personnel or students, or our employees or independent contractors, may post to our online learning platforms various articles or other third-party content for use in class discussions or within asynchronous lessons. 
 Various U.S. federal statutes may apply to us with respect to these activities. For example, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, or DMCA and the Communications Decency Act, or CDA, have provisions that limit our liability for certain content posted by third parties on our platforms. 
 Although statutes and case law in the U.S. have generally shielded us from liability for these activities to date, court rulings in pending or future litigation may narrow the scope of protection afforded us under these laws. In addition, laws governing these activities are unsettled in many international jurisdictions. As a result, we could incur liability to third parties for the unauthorized duplication, distribution or other use of third-party content. Any such claims could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether the claims have merit. Our various liability insurance coverages may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to alter or cease our uses of such material, which may include changing or removing content from courses or altering the functionality of our online learning platform, or to pay monetary damages. 
 Additionally, university personnel or students, or our employees or independent contractors could use our online learning platform to store or process regulated personal information without our knowledge. In the event that our systems experience a data security incident, or an individual or entity accesses information without, or in excess of, proper authorization, we could be subject to data security incident notification laws, as described elsewhere, which may require prompt remediation and notification to individuals. If we are unaware of the data and information stored on our systems, we may be unable to appropriately comply with all legal obligations, and we may be exposed to governmental enforcement or prosecution actions, private litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity and these incidents could harm our reputation and business. 
 Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our platform, weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue. 
 We regard the protection of our intellectual property, which includes trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and domain names, as critical to our success. We protect our proprietary information from unauthorized use and disclosure by entering into confidentiality agreements with any party that may come in contact with such information. We also seek to ensure that we own intellectual property created for us by signing agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants, companies and any other third party that may create intellectual property for us that assigns any copyright and patent rights to us. However, these arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information or deter independent development of similar technologies by others. 
 37 

Table of Contents 

We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in jurisdictions outside the United States. However, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe on our trademark or service mark rights, third parties may challenge our trademark or service mark rights, and pending or future trademark or service mark applications may not be approved. In addition, effective trademark protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate. In any or all cases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense to prevent infringement or enforce our rights. 
 Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. Our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. Further, we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Our competitors may also independently develop similar technology. In addition, the laws of many countries may not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Further, the laws in the United States and elsewhere change rapidly, and any future changes could adversely affect us and our intellectual property rights. Our failure to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could result in competitors offering services that incorporate our most technologically advanced features, which could seriously reduce demand for our platform. In addition, we may in the future need to initiate litigation such as infringement or administrative proceedings, to protect our intellectual property rights. Litigation, whether we are a plaintiff or a defendant, can be expensive, time-consuming and may divert the efforts of our technical staff and managerial personnel, whether or not such litigation results in a determination that is unfavorable to us. In addition, litigation is inherently uncertain, and thus we may not be able to stop our competitors from infringing upon our intellectual property rights. 
 The use of open source software in our platform could negatively affect our ability to offer our platform and subject us to possible litigation. 
 A portion of our platform incorporates so-called open source software, and we may incorporate additional open source software in the future. Certain open source licenses may, in certain circumstances, require us to offer our platform that incorporates the open source software for no cost, to make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software and to license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. Our efforts to monitor the use of open source software in our platform to ensure that no open source software is used in such a way as to require us to disclose our source code when we do not wish to do so, may be unable to prevent such use from occurring. In addition, if a third-party software provider has incorporated certain types of open source software into software we license from such third party without our knowledge, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to comply with the foregoing conditions. If an author or other third party that distributes open source software that we use were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, including being enjoined from offering the component of our platform that contained the open source software and being required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt our ability to offer certain components of our platform. 
 We could also be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. The terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts. Accordingly, there is a risk that those licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to offer our platform. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition and require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products. 
 Individuals that appear in content hosted on our online learning platform may claim violation of their rights. 
 Faculty and students that appear in video segments hosted on our online learning platform may claim that proper assignments, licenses, consents and releases were not obtained for use of their likenesses, images or other contributed content. Our contracts typically require that our university clients ensure that proper assignments, licenses, consents and releases are obtained for their course material, but we cannot know with certainty that they have obtained all necessary rights. Moreover, the laws governing rights of publicity and privacy, and the laws governing faculty ownership of course content, are imprecise and adjudicated on a case-by-case basis, such that the enforcement of agreements to transfer the necessary rights is unclear. As a result, we could incur liability to third parties for the unauthorized duplication, display, distribution or other use of this material. Any such claims could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether the claims have merit. Our various liability insurance coverages may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to alter or cease our use of such material, which may include changing or removing content from courses, or to pay monetary damages. Moreover, claims by faculty and students could damage our reputation, regardless of whether such claims have merit.

We do not control and may be unable to predict the future path of the Open edX Platform. 
 Certain of our offerings are hosted on the Open edX Platform that is owned by the non-profit entity that survived the edX Acquisition. We do not own the Open edX Platform and we do not control and may be unable to predict the future path of open source technology development of the Open edX Platform, including the ongoing development of open source components used in the Open edX Platform, which could reduce the appeal of our offerings hosted on the Open edX Platform and damage our reputation. If open source software programmers, many of whom we do not employ, or our own internal programmers do not continue to develop and enhance the Open edX Platform, we may be unable to meet student or university requirements. 
 Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock 
 Our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future, which could cause our stock price to decline. 
 Our operating results have historically fluctuated due to seasonality and changes in our business, and our future operating results may vary significantly due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. You should not rely on period-to-period comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our operating results include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 the timing of our costs incurred in connection with the launch of new degree programs and the delay in receiving revenue from these new programs, which delay may last for several years; 
 seasonal variation driven by the semester schedules for our university clients degree programs and seasonal engagement patterns of students on the edX marketplace, which may vary from year to year; 
 changes in the student enrollment and retention levels in our university clients offerings; 
 changes in our key metrics or the methods used to calculate our key metrics; 
 changes in tuition rates; 
 the timing and amount of our marketing and sales expenses; 
 costs necessary to improve and maintain our platform; 
 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; 
 the impact of pandemics, including on the global economy, educational institutions and our results of operations; 
 costs related to any acquisition and integration of business and technology; 
 our ability to effectively integrate businesses and technologies that we acquire; 
 impairment of goodwill or intangible assets; and 
 changes in the prospects of the economy generally, which could alter current or prospective university clients or students spending priorities or could increase the time it takes us to launch new offerings. 
 Our operating results may fall below the expectations of market analysts and investors in some future periods, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline substantially. 
 The trading price of the shares of our common stock may be volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses. 
 The trading price of the shares of our common stock may be volatile. The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price paid for the shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including: 
 actual or anticipated variations in our operating results; 
 variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community; 
 changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock or our failure to meet these financial estimates; 
 conditions or trends in our industry, the stock market or the economy; 
 39 

Table of Contents 

the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock; 
 stock market price and volume fluctuations of comparable companies and, in particular, those that operate in the software and information technology industries; 
 announcements by us or our competitors of new product or service offerings, significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures; 
 announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us; 
 capital commitments; 
 investors general perception of our company and our business; 
 actions instituted by activist shareholders or others; 
 lawsuits threatened or filed against us; 
 recruitment or departure of key personnel; 
 sales of our common stock, including sales by our directors and officers or specific stockholders; and 
 other factors such as political or social unrest, terrorist attacks, other hostilities, natural disasters and potential public health crises, such as COVID-19. 
 Activist shareholders who disagree with the composition of our board of directors, our strategy or the way we are managed may seek to effect change through various strategies that range from private engagement to publicity campaigns, proxy contests, efforts to force transactions not supported by our board of directors and litigation. Responding to these actions may be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, divert the attention of our board of directors, management and employees and interfere with the execution of our strategic plan. A contested election could also require us to incur substantial legal and public relations fees and proxy solicitation expenses. The perceived uncertainty as to our future direction resulting from activist strategies could also affect the market price and volatility of our common stock. 
 As described in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, certain stockholders and consumers have initiated class action lawsuits against us and certain of our employees and directors. Our defense against this litigation has caused and will continue to cause us to incur additional expenses and continue to divert management s attention and resources from our business. 
 Provisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to change our management and hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a result. 
 Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may make it difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change in control is considered favorable by you and other stockholders. For example, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The board of directors can fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders. An issuance of shares of preferred stock may result in the loss of voting control to other stockholders, which could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. As a result, the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our stockholders may be adversely affected. 
 Our charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, including: 
 our board of directors is divided into three classes, with each class serving three-year staggered terms, until our 2025 annual meeting of shareholders; 
 stockholders are not entitled to remove directors other than by a 66 2/3 vote and only for cause; 
 stockholders are not permitted to take actions by written consent; 
 stockholders are not permitted to call a special meeting of stockholders; 
 our board of directors is allowed to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws; and 
 stockholders are required to give us advance notice of their intention to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings. 
 40 

Table of Contents 

In addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law DGCL ), which regulates corporate acquisitions by prohibiting Delaware corporations from engaging in specified business combinations with particular stockholders of those companies. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock, including transactions that may be in your best interests. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management or limit the price that investors are willing to pay for our stock. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware are the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, stockholders, or employees and, in turn, discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers, or employees. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another state or federal court in the State of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, stockholders, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders; any action arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our bylaws; and any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision would not apply to any action brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts of the United States have exclusive jurisdiction. 
 This exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our current or former directors, officers, stockholders, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our current and former directors, officers, stockholders, and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Concentration of ownership of our common stock among our existing executive officers, directors and large stockholders may prevent smaller stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions. 
 Our executive officers, directors and current beneficial owners of 5 or more of our common stock and their respective affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially own a substantial percentage of our outstanding common stock. These persons, acting together, are able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors, any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other significant corporate transaction. The interests of this group of stockholders may not coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders. 
 Because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gains and you may never receive a return on your investment. 
 We have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock to date. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of our Term Loan Agreement preclude, and the terms of any future debt agreements are likely to similarly preclude, us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.

General Risk Factors 
 Increased scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, customers, employees, and others regarding our environmental, social and governance practices and reporting could cause us to incur additional costs, devote additional resources and expose us to additional risks, which could adversely impact our reputation, customer acquisition and retention, access to capital and employee retention. 
 Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their environmental, social and governance, or ESG, practices and reporting. Investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders have focused increasingly on ESG practices and placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments, purchases and other interactions with companies. For example, many investment funds focus on positive ESG business practices and sustainability scores when making investments and may consider a company s ESG or sustainability scores as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision. In addition, investors, particularly institutional investors, use these scores to benchmark companies against their peers and if a company is perceived as lagging, these investors may engage with such company to improve ESG disclosure or performance and may also make voting decisions on this basis. With this increased focus and demand, public reporting regarding ESG practices is becoming more broadly expected. If our ESG practices and reporting do not meet investor, customer, or employee expectations, which continue to evolve, our brand and reputation may be negatively impacted. Any disclosure we make may include our policies and practices on a variety of ESG matters, including corporate governance, environmental compliance, employee health and safety practices, human capital management, and workforce inclusion and diversity. It is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG reporting, our ESG practices or our speed of adoption. We could also incur additional costs and devote additional resources to monitor, report and implement various ESG practices. If we fail, or are perceived to be failing, to meet the standards included in any sustainability disclosure or the expectations of our various stakeholders, it could negatively impact our reputation, access to capital and employee retention. 
 If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired. 
 We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our Form 10-K filing for that year, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This may require us to incur substantial additional professional fees and internal costs to further expand our accounting and finance functions and expend significant management efforts. 
 We may in the future discover material weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements. In addition, our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to errors or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected. 
 If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. If that were to happen, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, or other regulatory authorities. 
 Our results of operations could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, political or geopolitical crises, the physical effects of climate changes or other catastrophic events. 
 Our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected in the event of droughts, floods, fires, telecommunications failures, blackouts or other power losses, break-ins, acts of terrorism, an outbreak of hostilities, political or geopolitical crises such as Russia's recent invasion of the Ukraine, inclement weather, the physical effects of climate change, public health crises, pandemics or endemics, or other catastrophic events. For example, the uncertain nature, magnitude, and duration of hostilities stemming from Russia s recent military invasion of the Ukraine, including the potential effects of sanctions and retaliatory cyber-attacks on the world economy and markets, have contributed to increased market volatility and uncertainty, which could negatively impact our results of operations.

 Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 Our common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market since March 28, 2014, under the symbol TWOU. 
 As of February 15, 2023, there were 45 stockholders of record of our common stock. The actual number of stockholders is greater than this number of record holders and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners but whose shares are held in street name by brokers and other nominees. This number of holders of record also does not include stockholders whose shares may be held in trust by other entities. 
 Stock Performance Graph 
 The graph set forth below compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with that of the Nasdaq Composite Index, the Russell 3000 Index and the S P North American Technology Software Index for the five years ended December 31, 2022. The graph assumes that 100 was invested at the close of market on the last trading day of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 in the common stock of 2U, Inc., the Nasdaq Composite Index, the Russell 3000 Index and the S P North American Technology Software Index. We have not paid any cash dividends and, therefore, the cumulative total return calculation on our common stock is based solely upon our stock price appreciation or depreciation and does not include any reinvestment of cash dividends. The data for the Nasdaq Composite Index, the Russell 3000 Index and the S P North American Technology Software Index assumes reinvestments of gross dividends. The comparisons shown in the graph below are based upon historical data, and are not necessarily indicative of, nor intended to forecast, the potential future stock performance of our common stock.

 Overview 
 We are a leading online education platform company. Our mission is to expand access to high-quality education and unlock human potential. As a trusted partner to top-ranked nonprofit universities and other leading organizations, we deliver technology and services that enable our clients to bring their educational offerings online at scale. Through edX, our best-in-class education consumer marketplace with 48 million registered learners, we host a comprehensive range of education offerings, from free courses to degree programs. 
 We serve more than 230 top-ranked global universities and other leading organizations and, together, we offer more than 4,000 high-quality online learning opportunities, including open courses, executive education offerings, boot camps, micro-credentials, professional certificates as well as undergraduate and graduate degree programs. Our offerings cover a wide range of topics including technology, business, healthcare, science, education, social work, and sustainability. Many of our offerings are stackable, providing learners with an affordable pathway to achieve both short-term and long-term professional and educational goals. Our platform provides our clients with the digital infrastructure to launch world-class online education offerings and allow students to easily access high-quality, job-relevant education without the barriers of cost or location. 
 We have two reportable segments: the Degree Program Segment and the Alternative Credential Segment. 
 In our Degree Program Segment, we provide technology and services to nonprofit colleges and universities to enable the online delivery of degree programs. Students enrolled in these programs are generally seeking an undergraduate or graduate degree of the same quality they would receive on campus. 
 In our Alternative Credential Segment, we provide premium online open courses, executive education programs, technical, skills-based boot camps and micro-credential programs through relationships with nonprofit colleges and universities and other leading organizations. Students enrolled in these offerings are generally seeking to reskill or upskill for career advancement or personal development through shorter duration, lower-priced offerings. In addition to selling these offerings directly to individuals, we also sell to organizations and institutions, including employers, non-profits, governments and governmental entities to enable upskilling and reskilling of their workforces. 
 Subsequent Event 
 In January 2023, we entered into an agreement to amend our First Amended Term Loan Agreement to, among other things, extend the maturity date from December 2024 to December 2026. In connection with amending the terms and extending the maturities under the First Amended Term Loan Agreement, we issued the 2030 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of 147.0 million. We used cash on hand and the 127.1 million of net proceeds from the 2030 Notes to reduce the outstanding principal amount of secured debt under the Amended Term Loan Facilities from 567 million to 380 million. As part of the refinancing transaction, in addition to extending the maturity date, the lenders provided us with a senior secured first lien revolving loan facility in the principal amount of 40 million. Refer to Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our debt. 
 2022 Strategic Realignment Plan 
 During the second quarter of 2022, we accelerated our planned transition to a platform company (the 2022 Strategic Realignment Plan ). The plan was designed to reorient the company around a single platform allowing us to pursue a portfolio-based marketing strategy that drives traffic to the edX marketplace. As part of the plan, we simplified our executive structure, reduced employee headcount, rationalized our real estate footprint and implemented steps to optimize marketing spend. 
 45 

Table of Contents 

As a result of the plan, in addition to marketing efficiencies, we expect to generate approximately 70 million in annual cost savings. We anticipate that we will incur aggregate restructuring charges associated with the 2022 Strategic Realignment Plan of approximately 35 million to 40 million. We recorded 30.7 million in restructuring charges related to the 2022 Strategic Realignment Plan for the year ended December 31, 2022. The majority of the estimated remaining restructuring charges relate to leased facilities, and will be recognized as expense over the remaining lease terms ranging from 1 to 9 years. 
 Certain Trends and Uncertainties 
 The following represents a summary of certain trends and uncertainties, which could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations. This summary is not intended to be a complete list of potential trends and uncertainties and should be considered along with the factors identified in the section titled Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and elsewhere in this report. 
 The risk of a data security breach or service disruption has increased as the frequency, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. While we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our services and computer systems, our cybersecurity measures and the cybersecurity measures taken by our third-party software and service providers may be unable to anticipate, detect or prevent all attempts to compromise our systems. In particular, the risk of cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents may be heightened because many of our employees and third-party service providers work remotely from networks that may be less secure. 
 We and our university clients are subject to certain education laws, regulations and guidance that are frequently revised, repealed or expanded. Any administration may change certain DOE rules, guidance or policies in accordance with its policy priorities. The outcome of the process to re-authorize the HEA, any DOE rulemakings, or other law, guidance or policy changes may alter the regulatory landscape of the higher education industry, and thereby impact the manner in which we conduct business and serve our university clients. 
 A general slowdown in the global economy, including a recession, inflation or a tightening of the credit markets could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Demand for our offerings from students can be impacted by the labor market and general economic conditions. For example, in a strong job market, demand for our offerings may decrease. Macroeconomic weakness and uncertainty may also make it more difficult to access capital markets and to forecast our future operating results including revenue, cash flows, and profitability. 
 During the second quarter of 2022, we implemented the 2022 Strategic Realignment Plan, accelerating our transition to a platform company. We believe the implementation of the 2022 Strategic Realignment Plan will strengthen our business by driving profitability and cash flow. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits of the 2022 Strategic Realignment Plan, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 Our Business Model and Components of Operating Results 
 The key elements of our business model and components of our operating results are described below. 
 Revenue Drivers 
 In our Degree Program Segment, we derive substantially all of our revenue from revenue-share arrangements with our university clients under which we receive a contractually specified percentage of the amounts students pay them to enroll in degree programs. In our Alternative Credential Segment, we derive substantially all of our revenue from tuition and fees from students taking our executive education programs, boot camps, and premium online open courses. Revenue in each segment is primarily driven by the number of student enrollments in our offerings. 
 Operating Expense 
 Marketing and Sales 
 Our most significant expense relates to marketing and sales activities to attract students to our offerings across both of our segments. This includes the cost of Search Engine Optimization, Search Engine Marketing and Social Media Optimization, as well as personnel and personnel-related expense for our marketing and recruiting teams. 
 In our Degree Program Segment, our marketing and sales expense in any period generates student enrollments eight months later, on average. We then generate revenue as students progress through their programs, which generally occurs over a two-year period following initial enrollment. Accordingly, our marketing and sales expense in any period is an investment to generate revenue in future periods. Therefore, we do not believe it is meaningful to directly compare current period revenue to current period marketing and sales expense. Further, in this segment we believe that our marketing and sales expense in future 
 46 

Table of Contents 

periods will generally decline as a percentage of the revenue reported in those same periods as our revenue base from returning students in existing programs increases. 
 In our Alternative Credential Segment, our marketing and sales expense in any period generates student enrollments as much as 24 weeks later. We then generate revenue as students progress through their courses, which typically occurs over a two- to six-month period following initial enrollment. 
 Curriculum and Teaching 
 Curriculum and teaching expense consists primarily of amounts due to universities for licenses to use their brand names and other trademarks in connection with our executive education and boot camp offerings. The payments are based on contractually specified percentages of the tuition and fees we receive from students in those offerings. Curriculum and teaching expense also includes personnel and personnel-related expense for our executive education and boot camp instructional staff. 
 Servicing and Support 
 Servicing and support expense consists primarily of personnel and personnel-related expense associated with the management and operations of our educational offerings, as well as supporting students and faculty members. Servicing and support expense also includes expenses to support our platform, facilitate in-program field placements and student immersions, and assist with compliance requirements. 
 Technology and Content Development 
 Technology and content development expense consists primarily of personnel and personnel-related expense associated with the ongoing improvement and maintenance of our platform, as well as hosting and licensing expenses. Technology and content expense also includes the amortization of capitalized technology and content. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel and personnel-related expense for our centralized functions, including executive management, legal, finance, human resources, and other departments that do not provide direct operational services. General and administrative expense also includes professional fees and other corporate expenses. 
 Restructuring charges 
 Restructuring charges consist of severance and severance-related costs, costs associated with the exit of facilities, and costs associated with professional services. 
 Net Interest Income (Expense) 
 Net interest income (expense) consists primarily of interest expense from our long-term debt and interest income from our cash and cash equivalents. Interest expense also includes the amortization of debt issuance costs. 
 Loss on Debt Extinguishment 
 Loss on debt extinguishment consists of amounts recorded related to the retirement of our debt obligations. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency gains and losses, gains and losses related to the sale of investments and other non-operating income and expense. 
 Income Taxes 
 Our income tax provisions for all periods consist of U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes. Our effective tax rate for the period is based on a mix of higher-taxed and lower-taxed jurisdictions. On August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, implements a 15 minimum tax on book income of certain large corporations, a 1 excise tax on net stock repurchases and several tax incentives to promote clean energy. Currently, we do not believe this legislation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

 Revenue . Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 17.4 million, or 1.8 , to 963.1 million as compared to 945.7 million in 2021. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 includes 39.2 million of revenue from legacy edX offerings. 
 Revenue from our Degree Program Segment decreased 20.7 million, or 3.5 . Average revenue per full course equivalent FCE enrollment decreased from 2,497 to 2,447, or 2.0 , and FCE enrollments decreased by 3,610, or 1.5 . 
 Revenue from our Alternative Credential Segment increased 38.1 million, or 10.8 . FCE enrollments increased by 7,387, or 8.6 , and average revenue per FCE enrollment decreased from 4,105 to 3,897, or 5.1 . 
 Curriculum and Teaching. Curriculum and teaching expense decreased 0.9 million, or 0.7 , to 129.9 million as compared to 130.8 million in 2021. The 2022 expense includes 0.2 million of operating expense from edX. The remaining decrease of 1.1 million was primarily due to lower expense as a result of a reduction in amounts due to university clients driven by lower revenue in certain offerings in our Alternative Credential Segment. 
 Servicing and Support. Servicing and support expense increased 9.2 million, or 6.7 , to 147.8 million as compared to 138.5 million in 2021. The 2022 expense includes 10.8 million of operating expense from edX, an increase of 9.1 million. The remaining increase of 0.1 million was primarily due to a 1.9 million increase in other student support costs, partially offset by a 1.8 million decrease in personnel and personnel-related expense. 
 Technology and Content Development. Technology and content development expense increased 11.4 million, or 6.4 , to 190.5 million as compared to 179.1 million in 2021. The 2022 expense includes 21.2 million of operating expense from 
 48 

Table of Contents 

edX, an increase of 17.1 million. The remaining decrease of 5.7 million was primarily due to an 8.0 million decrease in personnel and personnel-related expense driven by headcount reductions in connection with the 2022 Strategic Realignment Plan and lower performance-based compensation. This decrease was partially offset by a 3.0 million increase in expenses to support our platform and software applications. 
 Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expense decreased 33.9 million, or 7.4 , to 422.1 million as compared to 456.1 million in 2021. The 2022 expense includes 29.4 million of operating expense from edX, an increase of 24.4 million. The remaining decrease of 58.3 million was primarily due to a 51.1 million decrease in marketing expense from the implementation of a more efficient marketing framework and a 13.0 million decrease in personnel and personnel-related expense driven by headcount reductions in connection with the 2022 Strategic Realignment Plan and lower performance-based compensation. These decreases were partially offset by a 4.1 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense. 
 General and Administrative. General and administrative expense decreased 40.6 million, or 20.3 , to 159.4 million as compared to 200.1 million in 2021. The 2022 expense includes 6.4 million of operating expense from edX, an increase of 2.8 million. The remaining decrease of 43.4 million was primarily due to a 27.0 million decrease in personnel and personnel-related expense driven by headcount reductions in connection with the 2022 Strategic Realignment Plan and lower performance-based compensation, a 13.9 million decrease in transaction and integration expense, and a 2.7 million decrease in certain litigation-related expense. 
 Restructuring Charges. Restructuring charges increased 24.7 million, or 289.0 , to 33.2 million as compared to 8.5 million in 2021. Restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2022 include 15.4 million in severance and severance-related expense, 12.3 million in lease and facility exit costs, 2.0 million in professional and other fees relating to restructuring activities, and 1.0 million in acceleration of certain technology and content development costs, each in connection with the 2022 Strategic Realignment Plan, and 2.5 million in other restructuring charges. Restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2021 include 6.4 million in lease and facility exit costs and 2.1 million in severance and severance-related expense. 
 Impairment Charges. In the first quarter of 2022, we recorded impairment charges of 28.8 million and 30.0 million to goodwill and the indefinite-lived intangible asset, respectively. In the third quarter of 2022, we recorded impairment charges of 50.2 million and 29.3 million to goodwill and the indefinite-lived intangible asset, respectively. 
 Net Interest Income (Expense). Net interest expense increased 11.3 million, or 23 , to 61.1 million as compared to 49.7 million in 2021. This increase was primarily due to a 31.7 million increase in interest expense incurred under our Amended Term Loan Facilities. This increase was partially offset by a 20.3 million decrease in interest expense due to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, which eliminated the amortization of the debt discount previously associated with the 2025 Notes. 
 Loss on Debt Extinguishment . The loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 2021 was due to the write-off of deferred financing costs and fees paid in connection with the termination of our 50 million credit agreement in June 2021. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net. Other expense, net was 3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to other income, net of 22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This change was primarily due to the gain recognized in connection with the sale of our investment in an education technology company in 2021. 
 Income Tax Benefit. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized an income tax benefit of 0.9 million, and our effective tax rate was approximately 0.3 . For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized an income tax benefit of 1.2 million, and our effective tax rate was approximately 0.6 . To date, we have not been required to pay U.S. federal income taxes because of our current and accumulated net operating losses.

Business Segment Operating Results 
 We define segment profitability as net income or net loss, as applicable, before net interest income (expense), other income (expense), net, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, transaction costs, integration costs, restructuring-related costs, stockholder activism costs, certain litigation-related costs, consisting of fees for certain non-ordinary course litigation and other proceedings, impairment charges, losses on debt extinguishment, and stock-based compensation expense. Some of these items may not be applicable in any given reporting period and they may vary from period to period. Total segment profitability is a non-GAAP measure when presented outside of the financial statement footnotes. Total segment profitability is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends, to develop short- and long-term operational plans and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating total segment profitability can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business. Accordingly, we believe that total segment profitability provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of total segment profitability to net loss for each of the periods indicated. 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (in thousands) Net loss (322,151) (194,766) Adjustments: Stock-based compensation expense 80,220 97,766 Other (income) expense, net 3,815 (22,324) Net interest expense 61,069 49,747 Income tax benefit (903) (1,196) Depreciation and amortization expense 128,153 108,448 Loss on debt extinguishment 1,101 Impairment charges 138,291 Restructuring charges 33,239 8,544 Other 3,348 19,257 Total adjustments 447,232 261,343 Total segment profitability 125,081 66,577

 Immaterial amounts of intersegment revenue have been excluded from the above results for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 Degree Program Segment profitability increased 54.6 million, or 43 , to 180.7 million as compared to 126.1 million in 2021. This increase was primarily due to lower operating expenses due to the implementation of the 2022 Strategic Realignment Plan and lower performance-based compensation, partially offset by a decline in revenue of 20.7 million. 
 Alternative Credential Segment profitability increased 3.9 million, or 7 , to (55.6) million as compared to (59.6) million in 2021. This increase was primarily due to revenue growth of 38.1 million, including an increase of 22.0 million from the addition of edX offerings, partially offset by higher operating expenses, including a 33.1 million increase in operating expenses from edX that are included in segment profitability. 
 
 Key Business and Financial Performance Metrics 
 We use a number of key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. In addition to adjusted EBITDA (loss), which we discuss below, and revenue and the components of loss from operations in the section above entitled Our Business Model and Components of Operating Results, we utilize FCE enrollments as a key metric to evaluate the success of our business. 
 Full Course Equivalent Enrollments 
 We measure FCE enrollments for each of the courses offered during a particular period by taking the number of students enrolled in that course and multiplying it by the percentage of the course completed during that period. We add the FCE enrollments for each course within each segment to calculate the total FCE enrollments per segment. This metric allows us to consistently view period-over-period changes in enrollments by accounting for the fact that many courses we enable straddle multiple fiscal quarters. For example, if a course had 25 enrolled students and 40 of the course was completed during a particular period, we would count the course as having 10 FCE enrollments for that period. Any individual student may be enrolled in more than one course during a period. 
 Average revenue per FCE enrollment represents our weighted-average revenue per course across the mix of courses being offered during a period in each of our operating segments. This number is derived by dividing the total revenue for a period for each of our operating segments by the number of FCE enrollments within the applicable segment during that same period. This amount may vary from period to period depending on the academic calendars of our university clients, the relative growth rates of our degree programs, executive education programs, and boot camps, as applicable, and varying tuition levels, among other factors. 
 For the Degree Program Segment, FCE enrollments and average revenue per FCE enrollment include enrollments and revenue from edX bachelor s and master s degree offerings. For the Alternative Credential Segment, FCE enrollments and average revenue per FCE enrollment exclude enrollments and revenue from edX offerings due to the large number of learners taking free or low-cost courses. We believe excluding the impact of these enrollments and revenue is useful to investors because it facilitates a period-to-period comparison.

 Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) 
 We define adjusted EBITDA (loss) as net income or net loss, as applicable, before net interest income (expense), other income (expense), net, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, transaction costs, integration costs, restructuring-related costs, stockholder activism costs, certain litigation-related costs, consisting of fees for certain non-ordinary course litigation and other proceedings, impairment charges, losses on debt extinguishment, and stock-based compensation expense. Some of these items may not be applicable in any given reporting period and they may vary from period to period. 
 Adjusted EBITDA (loss) is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends, to develop short- and long-term operational plans and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses that are not reflective of our ongoing operating results in calculating adjusted EBITDA (loss) can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA (loss) provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. 
 Adjusted EBITDA (loss) is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our use of adjusted EBITDA (loss) has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of the limitations are: 
 although depreciation and amortization expense are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA (loss) does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; 
 adjusted EBITDA (loss) does not reflect (i) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (ii) the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates; (iii) acquisition related gains or losses such as, but not limited to, post-acquisition changes in the value of contingent consideration reflected in operations; (iv) transaction and integration costs; (v) restructuring-related costs; (vi) impairment charges; (vii) stockholder activism costs; (viii) certain litigation-related costs; (ix) losses on debt extinguishment; (x) interest or tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash; or (xi) the non-cash expense or the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation, which has been, and we expect will continue to be, an important part of our compensation plan; and 
 other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA (loss) differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
 Because of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA (loss) alongside other U.S. GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income (loss) and our other U.S. GAAP results. The following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA (loss) to net loss for each of the periods indicated.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of December 31, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling 167.5 million, which were held for working capital and general corporate purposes. 
 In April 2020, we issued the 2025 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of 380 million, including the exercise by the initial purchasers of an option to purchase additional 2025 Notes, in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A of the Securities Act. The 2025 Notes are governed by an indenture (the 2025 Indenture between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee. The 2025 Notes bear interest at a rate of 2.25 per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2020. The 2025 Notes mature on May 1, 2025, unless repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Prior to November 1, 2024, the 2025 Notes are convertible only upon satisfaction of certain conditions, and thereafter at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading date immediately before the maturity date. In connection with the 2025 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with a premium cost of approximately 50.5 million. The capped call transactions are generally expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the 2025 Notes and/or to offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of the converted 2025 Notes, with such reduction and/or offset subject to the cap. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Notes were 319.0 million after deducting the initial purchasers discount, offering expenses and the cost of the capped call transactions. As of December 31, 2022, the conditions allowing holders of the 2025 Notes to convert had not been met and we have the right under the 2025 Indenture to determine the method of settlement at the time of conversion, and the 2025 Notes, therefore, are classified as a non-current on the consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our 2025 Notes. 
 On April 23, 2020, we repaid our 250 million senior secured term loan facility in full (including interest and prepayment premium) and terminated our credit agreement with Owl Rock Capital Corporation. In connection with the extinguishment of our 250 million senior secured term loan facility, we recognized a charge of approximately 11.7 million in the second quarter of 2020. 
 On June 25, 2020, we entered into a 50 million credit agreement with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent and collateral agent, and certain other lenders party thereto that provided for 50 million in revolving loans. In connection with entering into the Term Loan Agreement (as defined below) in June 2021, we terminated our 50 million credit agreement with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. Refer to Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. 
 On August 6, 2020, we sold 6,800,000 shares of our common stock to the public. We received net proceeds of 299.8 million, which we use for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 
 In June 2021, we entered into a Term Loan Credit and Guaranty Agreement, dated June 28, 2021 the Term Loan Agreement ), with Alter Domus (US) LLC as administrative agent and collateral agent, to make term loans to us in the aggregate principal amount of 475 million (the 2021 Term Loan Facilities ), which have an initial maturity date of December 28, 2024. Loans under this facility bear interest at a per annum rate equal to a base rate or adjusted Eurodollar rate, as applicable, plus the applicable margin of 4.75 in the case of the base rate loans and 5.75 in the case of the Eurodollar loans. We used the proceeds of the 2021 Term Loan Facilities to fund a portion of the edX Acquisition and to pay related costs, fees and expenses. On November 4, 2021, we entered into a First Amendment to Term Loan Credit and Guaranty Agreement and a Joinder Agreement, which amended the Term Loan Agreement (collectively, the Amended Term Loan Facilities primarily to provide for an incremental facility to us in an original principal amount of 100 million. The proceeds of the Amended Term Loan Facilities may be used for general corporate purposes. Refer to Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our Amended Term Loan Facilities. 
 In January 2023, we entered into an Extension Amendment, Second Amendment and First Incremental Agreement to Credit and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of January 9, 2023 (the Second Amended Credit Agreement and issued the 2030 Notes. Refer to Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. 
 We have financed our operations primarily through payments from university clients and students for our technology and services, the Amended Term Loan Facilities, the 2025 Notes, and public and private equity financings. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations and available borrowing capacity under the Amended Term Loan Facilities, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months. We regularly evaluate our liquidity position, debt obligations, maturity schedule, and anticipated cash needs, and

may consider capital raising, refinancing, and other market opportunities that may be available to us to optimize our balance sheet. 
 Our operations require us to make capital expenditures for content development, capitalized technology, and property and equipment and to service our debt. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our capital asset additions were 75.4 million and 72.0 million, respectively. 
 We or our affiliates may, at any time and from time to time, seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands). 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 10,927 (18,074) Net cash used in investing activities (69,350) (793,434) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (6,925) 544,860 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (1,983) (2,309) Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (67,331) (268,957) 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash flows from operating activities have typically been generated from our net income (loss) and by changes in our operating assets and liabilities, adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense. Our cash flows from operations can fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to changes in accounts receivable and deferred revenue driven by the varying academic schedules of our offerings and university clients. In addition to these fluctuations in working capital, cash flows from operations at the beginning of the year are impacted by greater marketing spend and the timing of certain payments. We typically reduce our paid search and other marketing and sales efforts during late November and December because of less demand during the holiday season. 
 The following sections set forth the components of our 10.9 million of cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Net (loss) income (adjusted for non-cash charges) 
 The following table sets forth our net loss (adjusted for non-cash charges) during the year ended December 31, 2022 (in thousands):

Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of assets and liabilities acquired 
 The following table sets forth the net cash used in changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2022 (in thousands): 
 Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of assets and liabilities acquired: Cash used in accounts receivable, net and other receivables, net (3,558) Cash used in prepaid expenses, other assets, and other liabilities, net (37,082) Cash used in accounts payable and accrued expenses (42,735) Cash provided by deferred revenue 5,326 Net cash used in changes in operating assets and liabilities (78,049) 
 From December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022: 
 Accounts receivable, net and other receivables, net increased 3.6 million due to the timing of collections from our university partners. 
 Other liabilities decreased 41.9 million, primarily due to a decrease in our lease liability and payments made to university clients in certain of our alternative credential offerings. 
 Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased 42.7 million, primarily due to a decrease in accrued compensation and related benefits. 
 Deferred revenue increased 5.3 million, primarily due to the timing of our Degree Program Segment clients academic terms. 
 Investing Activities 
 Our investing activities primarily consist of strategic acquisitions, divestitures and purchases of property and equipment to support the overall growth of our business. We expect our investing cash flows to be affected by the timing of payments we make for capital expenditures and the strategic acquisition or other growth opportunities we decide to pursue. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in investing activities was 69.4 million. This use of cash was driven by cash outflows of 62.4 million for the addition of amortizable intangible assets and 11.8 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by a purchase price adjustment related to a change in net working capital which reduced the preliminary purchase price of the edX Acquisition by 5.0 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 Our financing activities primarily consist of long-term debt borrowings, the repayment of principal on long-term debt, tax withholding payments associated with the settlement of restricted stock units and the exercise of stock options. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in financing activities was 6.9 million. This use of cash was driven by cash outflows of 7.2 million for quarterly amortization payments on our Amended Term Loan Facilities and 2.9 million for tax withholding payments associated with the settlement of restricted stock units, partially offset by a cash inflow of 2.4 million from cash proceeds received from employee stock purchase plan share purchases and the exercise of stock options.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 The following table summarizes our obligations under the 2025 Notes, deferred government grant obligations, non-cancelable operating leases, commitments to certain of our university clients in exchange for contract extensions and various marketing and other rights, and purchase obligations as of December 31, 2022. Future events could cause actual payments to differ from these amounts.

 Amounts represent principal and interest, based on the interest rate in effect at December 31, 2022. In January 2023, we amended the Amended Term Loan Facilities to, among other things, extend the maturity date from December 2024 to December 2026. We prepaid certain amounts under the term loan facilities to reduce the outstanding principal amount from 567 million to 380 million. 
 Amounts represent principal and fixed-rate interest cash payments over the life of the 2025 Notes, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Any future settlement of the 2025 Notes would impact our cash payments. In January 2023, we issued the 2030 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of 147 million. The 2030 Notes have a maturity date in February 2030. 
 Other purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the table above. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities. 
 
 Contingent Payments 
 We have entered into agreements with certain of our university clients in our Degree Program Segment that require us to make future minimum payments in the event that certain program metrics are not achieved on an annual basis. We recognize any estimated contingent payments under these agreements as contra revenue over the period to which they relate, and record a liability in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. 
 In the first quarter of 2019, we entered into an agreement to make investments in an education technology company of up to 15.0 million, upon demand by the investee. During the second quarter of 2021, we sold our investment in this education technology company and were released from any further obligation to make additional investments. 
 See Note 7 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 and Legal Proceedings contained in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding contingencies. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 This management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates if conditions differ from our assumptions. 
 While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
 57 

Table of Contents 

Revenue Recognition, Receivables and Provision for Credit Losses 
 We generate substantially all of our revenue from contractual arrangements, with either our university clients or students, to provide a comprehensive platform of tightly integrated technology and technology-enabled services that support our offerings. 
 Performance Obligations 
 A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. A contract s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring services to the customer. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing the expected value method. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Any estimates, including the effect of the constraint on variable consideration, are evaluated at each reporting period, and if necessary, we adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Revenue is then recognized over the remaining estimated period of performance using the cumulative catch-up method. 
 Our Degree Program Segment derives revenue primarily from contractually specified percentages of the amounts our university clients receive from their students in 2U-enabled degree programs for tuition and fees, less credit card fees and other specified charges we have agreed to exclude in certain university contracts. Our contracts with university clients in this segment typically have terms of 10 to 15 years and have a single performance obligation, as the promises to provide a platform of tightly integrated technology and services that university clients need to attract, enroll, educate and support students are not distinct within the context of the contracts. The single performance obligation is delivered as the university clients receive and consume benefits, which occurs ratably over a series of academic terms. The amounts received from university clients over the term of the arrangement are variable in nature in that they are dependent upon the number of students that are enrolled in the program within each academic term. These amounts are allocated to and are recognized ratably over the related academic term, defined as the period beginning on the first day of classes through the last. Revenue is recognized net of an allowance, which is established for our expected obligation to refund tuition and fees to university clients. 
 Our Alternative Credential Segment derives revenue primarily from contracts with students for the tuition and fees paid to enroll in, and progress through, our executive education programs and boot camps. Our executive education programs run between two and 16 weeks, while our boot camps run between 12 and 24 weeks. In this segment, our contracts with students include the delivery of the educational and related student support services and are treated as either a single performance obligation or multiple performance obligations, depending upon the offering being delivered. All performance obligations are satisfied ratably over the same presentation period, which is defined as the period beginning on the first day of the course through the last. We recognize the proceeds received, net of any applicable pricing concessions, from the students enrolled and share contractually specified amounts received from students with the associated university client, in exchange for licenses to use the university brand name and other university trademarks. These amounts are recognized as curriculum and teaching expenses on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Our contracts with university clients in this segment are typically shorter and less restrictive than our contracts with university clients in our Degree Program Segment. 
 We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for our Degree Program Segment because the variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a service that forms part of a single performance obligation. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for our Alternative Credential Segment because the performance obligations are part of contracts that have original durations of less than one year. 
 Payments to University Clients 
 Pursuant to certain of our contracts in the Degree Program Segment, we have made, or are obligated to make, payments to university clients at either the execution of a contract or at the extension of a contract in exchange for various marketing and other rights. Generally, these amounts are capitalized as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets, and amortized as contra revenue over the life of the contract, commencing on the later of when payment is due or when contract revenue recognition begins. 
 Receivables, Contract Assets and Liabilities 
 Balance sheet items related to contracts consist of accounts receivable, net, other receivables, net and deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets. Accounts receivable, net includes trade accounts receivable, which are comprised of billed and unbilled revenue. Our trade accounts receivable balances have terms of less than one year. Accounts receivable, net is stated at amortized cost net of provision for credit losses. Our methodology to measure the provision for credit losses requires an estimation of loss rates based upon historical loss experience adjusted for factors that are relevant to determining the expected 
 58 

Table of Contents 

collectability of accounts receivable. Some of these factors include current market conditions, delinquency trends, aging behavior of receivables and credit and liquidity quality indicators for industry groups, customer classes or individual customers. Our estimates are reviewed and revised periodically based on the ongoing evaluation of credit quality indicators. Historically, actual write-offs for uncollectible accounts have not significantly differed from prior estimates. 
 We recognize unbilled revenue when revenue recognition occurs in advance of billings. Unbilled revenue is recognized in our Degree Program Segment because billings to university clients do not occur until after the academic term has commenced and final enrollment information is available. Our unbilled revenue represents contract assets. 
 Other receivables, net are comprised of amounts due under tuition payment plans with extended payment terms from students enrolled in certain of our alternative credential offerings. These plans, which are managed and serviced by third-party providers, are designed to assist students with covering tuition costs after all other student financial assistance and scholarships have been applied. The associated receivables generally have payment terms that exceed one year and are recorded net of any implied pricing concessions, which are determined based on our collections history, market data and any time value of money component. There are no fees or origination costs included in these receivables. 
 Deferred revenue represents the excess of amounts billed or received as compared to amounts recognized in revenue on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as of the end of the reporting period, and such amounts are reflected as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheets. Our deferred revenue represents contract liabilities. We generally receive payments from Degree Program Segment university clients early in each academic term and from Alternative Credential Segment students, either in full upon registration for the course or in full before the end of the course based on a payment plan, prior to completion of the service period. These payments are recorded as deferred revenue until the services are delivered or until our obligations are otherwise met, at which time revenue is recognized. 
 Business Combinations 
 The purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, based on their respective fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of an acquired entity, net of the amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, is recognized as goodwill. The net assets and results of operations of an acquired entity are included on our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date. 
 The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. 
 On November 16, 2021, we completed the edX Acquisition for a purchase price of 768.0 million. Refer to Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding this transaction. 
 Long-Lived Assets 
 Amortizable Intangible Assets 
 Acquired Definite-lived Intangible Assets. We capitalize purchased definite-lived intangible assets, such as software, websites and domains, and amortize them on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Historically, we have assessed the useful lives of these acquired intangible assets to be between three and 10 years. 
 Capitalized Technology. Capitalized technology includes certain purchased software and technology licenses, direct third-party costs, and internal payroll and payroll-related costs used in the creation of our internal-use software. Software development projects generally include three stages: the preliminary project stage (all costs are expensed as incurred), the application development stage (certain costs are capitalized and certain costs are expensed as incurred) and the post-implementation/operation stage (all costs are expensed as incurred). Costs capitalized in the application development stage include costs of designing the application, coding, integrating our and the university s networks and systems, and the testing of the software. Capitalization of costs requires judgment in determining when a project has reached the application development stage and the period over which we expect to benefit from the use of that software. Once the software is placed in service, these amounts are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is generally three to five years. 
 59 

Table of Contents 

Capitalized Content Development. We develop content for each offering on a course-by-course basis in collaboration with university client faculty and industry experts. Depending upon the offering, we may use materials provided by university clients and their faculty, including curricula, case studies, presentations and other reading materials. We are responsible for the creation of materials suitable for delivery through our online learning platform, including all expenses associated with this effort. With respect to the Degree Program Segment, the development of content is part of our single performance obligation and is considered a contract fulfillment cost. 
 The content development costs that qualify for capitalization are third-party direct costs, such as videography, editing and other services associated with creating digital content. Additionally, we capitalize internal payroll and payroll-related expenses incurred to create and produce videos and other digital content utilized in the university clients offerings for delivery via our online learning platform. Capitalization ends when content has been fully developed by both us and the university client, at which time amortization of the capitalized content development begins. The capitalized costs for each offering are recorded on a course-by-course basis and included in amortizable intangible assets, net on our consolidated balance sheets. These amounts are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the respective course, which is generally four to five years. The estimated useful life corresponds with the planned curriculum refresh rate. This refresh rate is consistent with expected curriculum refresh rates as cited by faculty members for similar on-campus offerings. 
 Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets 
 We review long-lived assets, which consist of property and equipment, capitalized technology, capitalized content development and acquired finite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. In order to assess the recoverability of the capitalized technology and content development, the amounts are grouped by the lowest level of independent cash flows. Recoverability of a long-lived asset is measured by a comparison of the carrying value of an asset or asset group to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group. If such assets are not recoverable, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds the estimated fair value (discounted cash flow) of the asset or asset group. Our impairment analysis is based upon cumulative results and forecasted performance. 
 Goodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets 
 We review goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, as of October 1, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of goodwill or an indefinite-lived asset below its carrying value. 
 Goodwill 
 We test our goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. We initially assess qualitative factors to determine if it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment review. We review goodwill for impairment using a quantitative approach if we decide to bypass the qualitative assessment or determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value based on a qualitative assessment. Upon completion of a quantitative assessment, we may be required to recognize an impairment based on the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the reporting unit. 
 We determine the fair value of a reporting unit by utilizing a weighted combination of the income-based and market-based approaches. 
 The income-based approach requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates. These assumptions and estimates primarily include, but are not limited to, discount rates, terminal growth rates, and forecasts of revenue and margins. When determining these assumptions and preparing these estimates, we consider each reporting unit s historical results and current operating trends, revenue, profitability, cash flow results and forecasts, and industry trends. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic and regulatory conditions, market capitalization, the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and prospective student enrollment patterns. 
 In addition, the value of a reporting unit using the market-based approach is estimated by comparing the reporting unit to other publicly-traded companies and/or to publicly-disclosed business mergers and acquisitions in similar lines of business. The value of a reporting unit is based on pricing multiples of certain financial parameters observed in the comparable companies. We also make estimates and assumptions for market values to determine a reporting unit s estimated fair value. 
 During both the first and third quarter of 2022, we experienced a significant decline in our market capitalization. Management deemed these declines triggering events related to our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset. As a result, we performed interim impairment assessments as of March 1, 2022 and September 30, 2022.

For each of the interim impairment assessments, we utilized a weighted combination of the income-based approach and market-based approach to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and the income-based approach to determine the fair value of its long-lived intangible asset. Key assumptions used in the income-based approach included forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization expense, capital expenditures and future working capital requirements, terminal growth rates, and discount rates based upon each respective reporting unit s or indefinite-lived intangible asset s weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the risk associated with the operations at the time of the assessment. The income-based approach largely relied on inputs that were not observable to active markets, which would be deemed Level 3 fair value measurements. Key assumptions used in the market-based approach included the selection of appropriate peer group companies. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used to estimate fair value could materially affect the determination of fair value and the impairment test result. 
 For the interim impairment assessment performed as of March 1, 2022, we determined the carrying value for one of our reporting units within our Alternative Credential Segment and the carrying value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeded their respective estimated fair value. As a result, during the three months ended March 31, 2022, we recorded impairment charges of 28.8 million and 30.0 million to goodwill and the indefinite-lived intangible asset, respectively. These charges are included within operating expense on our consolidated statements of operations. The estimated fair values of the remaining reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by approximately 10 or more. 
 For the interim impairment assessment performed as of September 30, 2022, we determined the carrying value for two of the reporting units within our Alternative Credential Segment and the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeded their respective estimated fair value. As a result, during the three months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded impairment charges of 50.2 million and 29.3 million to goodwill and the indefinite-lived intangible asset, respectively, both within our Alternative Credential Segment. These charges are included within operating expense on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. The estimated fair value of each of the remaining reporting units exceeded their respective carrying value by approximately 10 or more. 
 Changes in the estimates and assumptions used to estimate fair value could materially affect the determination of fair value and the impairment test result. For one of the reporting units within the Alternative Credential Segment, which had a goodwill balance of 97.2 million as of December 31, 2022, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 43.0 million and 71.8 million in the first and third quarter of 2022, respectively. For the impairment analysis performed as of September 30, 2022, a 1 increase or decrease to the discount rate, in isolation, would result in a 40.3 million decrease or a 53.5 million increase to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, respectively, and a 1 decrease or increase to the terminal growth rate, in isolation, would result a 27.6 million decrease or a 36.6 million increase to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, respectively. 
 For the other reporting unit within the Alternative Credential Segment, which had a goodwill balance of 59.3 million as of December 31, 2022, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 7.2 million in the third quarter of 2022. For the impairment analysis performed as of September 30, 2022, a 1 increase or decrease to the discount rate, in isolation, would result in a 5.2 million decrease or a 6.7 million increase to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, respectively, and a 1 decrease or increase to the terminal growth rate, in isolation, would result a 3.1 million decrease or a 3.9 million increase to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, respectively. 
 For the indefinite-lived intangible asset within the Alternative Credential Segment, we recorded impairment charges of 29.3 million and 59.3 million in the first and third quarter of 2022, respectively. For the impairment analysis performed as of September 30, 2022, a 1 increase or decrease to the discount rate, in isolation, would result in a 51.6 million decrease or a 66.3 million increase to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, respectively. 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the goodwill balance was 734.6 million and 834.5 million, respectively. See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for more information regarding goodwill. 
 Other Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets 
 Our indefinite-lived intangible asset was acquired in November 2021 and represents the established edX trade name. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the indefinite-lived intangible asset balance was 195.7 million and 255.0 million, respectively. See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for more information regarding the indefinite-lived intangible asset. 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 We provide stock-based compensation awards consisting of restricted stock units RSUs ), performance restricted stock units PRSUs and stock options to employees, directors and consultants. We measure all stock-based compensation awards at fair value as of the grant date. The fair values of RSUs and PRSUs containing performance-based vesting conditions are 
 61 

Table of Contents 

based on the fair value of our stock on the date of grant. We use a Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants and a Monte Carlo valuation model to estimate the fair value of PRSUs containing market-based vesting conditions. We also maintain the 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP and estimate the fair value of each purchase right thereunder as of the grant date using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. 
 The Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo valuation models require the input of subjective assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, expected life, expected stock price volatility and dividend yield. For stock option grants, the risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates for constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities consistent with the expected term of our employee stock options. The expected life represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the simplified method. Under the simplified method, the expected life of an option is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. We use the simplified method due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected life of the stock options. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the estimated expected life of the stock options. We assume no dividend yield because dividends are not expected to be paid in the near future, which is consistent with our history of not declaring or paying dividends to date. 
 For PRSUs subject to market-based vesting conditions, the risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates for constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities consistent with the expected life of the awards. The expected life is consistent with the performance measurement period of the awards. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the estimated expected life. We assume no dividend yield because dividends are not expected to be paid in the near future, which is consistent with our history of not declaring or paying dividends to date. The valuations determined by the Monte Carlo simulation utilize 50,000 future stock prices for us and our peer group. We have chosen this amount for the simulation as to minimize the standard modeling error and believe that the resulting distribution gives a reasonable estimate of the grant date fair value. 
 For awards subject only to service-based vesting conditions, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the awards requisite service period. For awards subject to both service and performance-based vesting conditions, we recognize stock-based compensation expense using an accelerated recognition method when it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. For awards subject to both service and market-based vesting conditions, we recognize stock-based compensation expense using an accelerated recognition method over the requisite service period beginning with the date of the grant and ending upon completion of the service period, with stock-based compensation expense being recognized irrespective of the achievement of the market condition. For shares subject to the ESPP, we use the straight-line method to record stock-based compensation expense over the respective offering period.

 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings, values or future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes. Our exposure to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is deemed moderate as further described below. In addition, we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative, hedging or trading purposes, although in the future we may enter into exchange rate hedging arrangements to manage the risks described in the succeeding paragraphs. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to interest rate risk through our borrowings under our Amended Term Loan Facilities. Loans under this facility bear interest at a per annum rate equal to a base rate or adjusted Eurodollar rate, as applicable, plus the applicable margin of 4.75 in the case of the base rate loans and 5.75 in the case of the Eurodollar loans. The effective interest rate of the Amended Term Loan Facilities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 9.10 . As of December 31, 2022, borrowings under our Amended Term Loan Facilities were 566.6 million. A hypothetical increase in interest rates by 100 basis points would increase interest expense by 5.7 million. 
 In January 2023, we entered into the Second Amended Credit Agreement. Loans under the Second Amended Credit Agreement will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to (i) with respect to term loans, a base rate or the Term SOFR (as 
 62 

Table of Contents 

defined in the Second Amended Credit Agreement) rate, as applicable, plus a margin of 5.50 in the case of the base rate loans and 6.50 in the case of Term SOFR loans and (ii) with respect to revolving loans, a base rate or the Term SOFR rate, as applicable, plus a margin of 4.50 in the case of the base rate loans and 5.50 in the case of Term SOFR loans. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 We transact material business in foreign currencies and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposures are related to non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue and operating expenses in South Africa and the United Kingdom. Accounts relating to foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using prevailing exchange rates at the relevant period end. As a result, we would experience increased revenue and operating expenses in our non-U.S. operations if there were a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to these foreign currencies. Conversely, we would experience decreased revenue and operating expenses in our non-U.S. operations if there were an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to these foreign currencies. Translation adjustments are included as a separate component of stockholders equity. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our foreign currency translation adjustment was a loss of 3.5 million and a loss of 6.1 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized foreign currency exchange losses of 4.2 million and 2.5 million, respectively, included on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
 The foreign exchange rate volatility of the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2022 was 12 and 9 for the South African rand and British pound, respectively. The foreign exchange rate volatility of the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2021 was 11 and 5 for the South African rand and British pound, respectively. A 10 fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates would have had an immaterial effect on our results of operations and cash flows for all periods presented. The fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period. Such volatility, even when it increases our revenue or decreases our expense, impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 2U, Inc.: 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of 2U, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement Schedule II - Valuation and Qualifying Accounts (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Change in Accounting Principle 
 As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for convertible debt as of January 1, 2022 due to the adoption of ASU No. 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity . 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Determination of implied pricing concessions 
 As discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s Alternative Credential Segment recorded revenue of 391 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the transaction price in certain contracts with customers of the Alternative Credential Segment includes variable consideration, subject to a constraint, in the form of implied pricing concessions. The Company initially estimates the value of implied pricing concessions, including the effect of the constraint on variable consideration, at contract inception and updates the estimate in each reporting period based on the Company s own collection history data and market data. 
 65 

Table of Contents 

We identified the assessment of the estimated implied pricing concessions as a critical audit matter. Significant auditor judgment was involved in evaluating the reliability of market data and the weighting applied to the Company s own collection history data and the market data used in estimating the overall rate of implied pricing concessions. 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company s process to estimate the overall rate of implied pricing concessions, including controls related to the reliability of the market data and determination of the weighting applied to the Company s own collection history data and market data used in the estimate. We evaluated the reliability of the market data by considering the source and nature of the data. We evaluated the reasonableness of the weighting applied to the Company s own collection history data and market data by performing sensitivity analyses over those inputs and by comparing the Company s overall rate of implied pricing concessions to data published by certain agencies of the federal government. 
 Impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset 
 As discussed in Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company reviews goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of goodwill or an indefinite-lived asset below its carrying value. The Company uses a weighted combination of the income-based and market-based approaches to determine the fair value of reporting units and an income-based model to determine the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets. During the first and third quarters of 2022, the Company determined that triggering events occurred and the carrying values of certain reporting units within the Alternative Credential Segment and an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeded their fair value, resulting in goodwill impairment charges of 79 million and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of 59 million. 
 We identified the impairment of goodwill for a reporting unit within the Alternative Credential Segment and an indefinite-lived intangible asset as a critical audit matter. A high degree of subjectivity was required to evaluate the forecasted revenue growth rates, including the terminal growth rate, margins and discount rate assumptions used in each of the income-based methodologies. Changes to these assumptions could have a substantial impact on the fair value of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset and the amount of the impairment charges. 
 The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company s goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analysis process, including controls related to the forecasted revenue growth rates, including the terminal growth rate, margins and the development of the discount rate assumptions. We evaluated the Company s forecasted revenue growth rates and margins by comparing them to historical actual results of the Company and its peers. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: 
 evaluating the Company s terminal growth rate by comparing to publicly available market data 
 evaluating the Company s discount rate assumptions by comparing the inputs to the discount rates to publicly available market data and historical experience.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 2U, Inc.: 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited 2U, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement Schedule II - Valuation and Qualifying Accounts (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The single performance obligation is delivered as the university clients receive and consume benefits, which occurs ratably over a series of academic terms. The amounts received from university clients over the term of the arrangement are variable in nature in that they are dependent upon the number of students that are enrolled in the program within each academic term. These amounts are allocated to and are recognized ratably over the related academic term, defined as the period beginning on the first day of classes through the last. Revenue is recognized net of an allowance, which is established for the Company s expected obligation to refund tuition and fees to university clients. 
 The Alternative Credential Segment derives revenue primarily from contracts with students for the tuition and fees paid to enroll in, and progress through, the Company s executive education programs and boot camps. In this segment, the Company s contracts with students include the delivery of the educational and related student support services and are treated as either a single performance obligation or multiple performance obligations, depending upon the offering being delivered. All performance obligations are satisfied ratably over the same presentation period, which is defined as the period beginning on the first day of the course through the last. The Company recognizes the proceeds received, net of any applicable pricing concessions, from the students enrolled and shares contractually specified amounts received from students with the associated university client, in exchange for licenses to use the university brand name and other university trademarks. These amounts are recognized as curriculum and teaching expenses on the Company s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company s contracts with university clients in this segment are typically shorter and less restrictive than the Company s contracts with university clients in the Degree Program Segment. 
 The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for the Degree Program Segment because the variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a service that forms part of a single performance obligation. The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for the Alternative Credential Segment because the performance obligations are part of contracts that have original durations of less than one year.

 Deferred revenue represents the excess of amounts billed or received as compared to amounts recognized in revenue on the Company s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as of the end of the reporting period, and such amounts are reflected as a current liability on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. The Company s deferred revenue represents contract liabilities. The Company generally receives payments from Degree Program Segment university clients early in each academic term and from Alternative Credential Segment students, either in full upon registration for the course or in full before the end of the course based on a payment plan, prior to completion of the service period. These payments are recorded as deferred revenue until the services are delivered or until the Company s obligations are otherwise met, at which time revenue is recognized. 
 Marketing and Sales Costs 
 The Company s marketing and sales costs relate to activities to attract students to offerings across both of the Company s segments. This includes the cost of Search Engine Optimization, Search Engine Marketing and Social Media Optimization, as well as personnel and personnel-related expense for the Company s marketing and recruiting teams. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, expense related to the Company s marketing and advertising efforts of its own brand were not material. All such costs are expensed as incurred and reported in marketing and sales expense on the Company s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Adoption of this ASU requires the use of the if-converted method for all convertible notes in the diluted net income (loss) per share calculation and the inclusion of the effect of potential share settlement of the convertible notes, if the effective is more dilutive. There was no impact to the number of potentially dilutive shares as a result of the adoption. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company s liquidity or cash flows. 
 In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting . This ASU is intended to provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contract modifications and hedging relationships, subject to meeting certain criteria, to ease the potential accounting and financial reporting burden associated with the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. This ASU may be applied as of the beginning of any interim period that includes its effective date (i.e., March 12, 2020) through December 31, 2022. On December 21, 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 . This ASU defers the sunset date from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024 and is effective immediately. The Company will adopt the standard when LIBOR is discontinued and does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
 In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures . This ASU eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors that have adopted ASU 2016-13 and enhances the disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings when borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty. In addition, the ASU requires the disclosure of current-period gross write-offs for financing receivables by year of origination in the vintage disclosures. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company is evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its disclosures but does not expect there to be a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

 The initial conversion rate for the 2025 Notes is 35.3773 shares of the Company s common stock per 1,000 principal amount of 2025 Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share of the Company s common stock, and is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events as set forth in the 2025 Indenture. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as applicable, cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company s common stock, at the Company s election. In the event of the Company calling the 2025 Notes for redemption or the holders of the 2025 Notes electing to convert their 2025 Notes, the Company will determine whether to settle in cash, common stock or a combination thereof. Upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the 2025 Indenture), the Company will in certain circumstances increase the conversion rate for a specified period of time. As of December 31, 2022, the if-converted value of the 2025 Notes did not exceed the principal amount. 
 In addition, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the 2025 Indenture), holders of the 2025 Notes may require the Company to repurchase their 2025 Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the 2025 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

In addition, calling any Note for redemption will constitute a make-whole fundamental change with respect to that Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that Note will be increased in certain circumstances if such Note is converted after it is called for redemption. No sinking fund is provided for the 2025 Notes.

million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The utilization of the NOL carryforwards to reduce future income taxes will depend on the Company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the NOL carryforwards. Under the provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 382, certain substantial changes in the Company s ownership may result in a limitation on the amount of U.S. net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and taxes payable.

Another significant section of the Tax Act, the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax BEAT ), did not apply to the Company s 2022 tax year as the Company s base erosion payments are less than 3 of the Company s total deductions. As these taxes may become applicable in the future, the Company will continue to monitor the potential impact.

 Stock Options 
 The Stock Plans provide for the issuance of stock options to eligible participants. Stock options issued under the Stock Plans generally are exercisable for periods not to exceed years. 
 The terms of stock option grants, including the exercise price per share and vesting periods, are determined by the Company s board of directors or the compensation committee thereof. Stock options are granted at exercise prices of not less than the estimated fair market value of the Company s common stock at the date of grant.

Stock options granted under the 2014 Plan and the 2008 Plan are subject to service-based vesting conditions, and generally expire from the grant date. 
 The Company values stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, expected life of the option, expected stock price volatility and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates for constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities consistent with the expected term of the Company s employee stock options. The expected life represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the simplified method. Under the simplified method, the expected life of an option is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. The Company uses the simplified method due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected life of the stock options. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s common stock over the estimated expected life of the stock options. The Company assumes no dividend yield

The following summary includes a brief description of the common stock as well as certain related information. 
 The following summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of our Eighth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Certificate of Incorporation and our Fifth Amended and Restated Bylaws (the Bylaws ). For additional information please refer to the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, each of which are exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the DGCL ). 
 General 
 Under our Certificate of Incorporation, the total number of shares of all classes of capital stock which the Company shall have authority to issue is 205,000,000, which consists of two classes as follows (i) 200,000,000 shares of common stock and (ii) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, 0.001 par value per share (the preferred stock ). Our Board of Directors (the Board is expressly authorized to provide for the issue of the shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and to fix the number of shares and to determine or alter for each such series, such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designation, preferences, and relative, participating, optional, or other rights and such qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereof, of the preferred stock from time to time. We currently have no preferred stock outstanding. 
 Common Stock 
 Voting Rights. 
 Each holder of our common stock is entitled to one vote for each share on all matters properly submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company, including the election of directors provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of shares of common stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of preferred stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of preferred stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon by law or pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of preferred stock). Except as otherwise provided by statute or by applicable stock exchange rules, or by the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, in all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote generally on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders. Except as otherwise provided by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, directors shall be elected by a majority of the votes of the shares present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote generally on the election of directors. Under our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights. Because of this, the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors can elect all of the directors standing for election, if they should so choose. 

Dividends. 
 Subject to applicable law and the preferential rights as to dividends of the holders of all classes or series of preferred stock at the time outstanding, holders of shares of common stock are entitled to receive such dividends when, as and if declared from time to time by the Board out of legally available funds of the Company. 
 Classification of the Board of Directors. 
 Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, (a) each director elected at or prior to the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders shall be elected for a term expiring on the date of the third annual meeting of stockholders following the annual meeting at which the director was elected (b) each director elected at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders shall be elected for a one-year term expiring at the 2024 annual meeting of stockholders (the 2024 Annual Meeting (c) each director elected at the 2024 Annual Meeting shall be elected for a one-year term expiring at the 2025 annual meeting of stockholders (the 2025 Annual Meeting and (d) commencing at the 2025 Annual Meeting and each annual meeting of stockholders thereafter, all directors shall be elected for a one-year term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders and the Board of Directors shall no longer be divided into separate classes. Each director shall serve until their successor is duly elected and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal. 
 Liquidation. 
 In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up (either voluntary or involuntary), holders of shares of common stock will be entitled to receive the assets and funds of the Company available for distribution after payments to creditors and to the holders of any preferred stock that may at the time be outstanding, in proportion to the number of shares held by them, respectively, without regard to class. 
 Rights and Preferences. 
 Holders of shares of common stock have no preemptive, conversion or subscription rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. 
 Certain Other Provisions of Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws 
 The following provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws could be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and could delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider to be in the stockholders best interests. 
 Advance notice of director nominations and matters to be acted upon at meetings . Our Bylaws contain advance notice requirements for nominations for election of directors to our Board and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. 
 Removal of directors. Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that neither the Board nor any individual director may be removed without cause and, subject to any limitation imposed by law, may be removed with cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2 3 of the voting power of all then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally at an election of directors. Following the completion of the Company s 2025 Annual Meeting and the declassification of our Board, directors (subject to the Certificate of Incorporation and the rights of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances) may be removed at any time either, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of all then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally at an election of directors, voting as a single class, except as otherwise required by applicable law. 

Board size Vacancies. Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that the number of directors that shall constitute the Board may be fixed only by resolution adopted by a majority of the authorized number of directors constituting the Board, and vacancies and newly created directorships on the Board may, unless the Board determines by resolution that any such vacancy or newly created directorship shall be filled by the stockholders, be filled only by a majority vote of the directors then serving on the Board, even though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. 
 Stockholder Actions . Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that action shall be taken by the stockholders only at annual or special meetings of stockholders and stockholders may not act by written consent. 
 Special Meetings of Stockholders . Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the Board, a majority of the members of the Board pursuant to a resolution approved by the Board, or a committee of the Board that has been duly designated by the Board and the powers of which specifically include the authority to call such meetings, and special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons. 
 Preferred Stock . Preferred stock could be issued with terms calculated to delay, defer or prevent a change in our control or to make it more difficult to remove our management. 
 Amendments. Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that in addition to any other vote required by law or our Certificate of Incorporation, the vote of 66 2 3 or more of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors shall be required to amend alter, amend or repeal Articles V, VI, VII and VIII of the Certificate of Incorporation. Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that our Board is authorized to adopt, amend or repeal our Bylaws without further stockholder approval. Our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws also provide that the stockholders can amend the bylaws provided, however, that in addition to any other vote required by law or our Certificate of Incorporation, the vote of 66 2 3 or more of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors shall be required for the stockholders to amend our Bylaws. 
 Forum Selection Provision . Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company s stockholders (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Company arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine provided, however, that, in the event the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks jurisdiction over any such proceeding, the sole and exclusive forum for such action or proceeding shall be another state or federal court located within the State of Delaware.
