Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information 
 Certain statements in this annual report on Form 10-K (this Annual Report constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements that do not relate strictly to historical or current facts, but reflect management s current understandings, intentions, beliefs, plans, expectations, assumptions and/or predictions regarding the future of our business and its performance, the economy and other future conditions and forecasts of future events and circumstances. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as believes, expects, anticipates, intends, estimates, plans, continues, pro forma, may, will, seeks, should and could, and words and terms of similar substance, although not all forward-looking statements include these words. The forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report involve risks and uncertainties, including statements as to: 
 our future operating results; 
 our business prospects and the prospects of our businesses and other assets; 
 unanticipated costs, delays and other difficulties in executing our business strategy; 
 performance of our businesses and other assets relative to our expectations and the impact on our actual return on invested equity, as well as the cash provided by these assets; 
 our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 
 actual and potential conflicts of interest with the Manager, the Sub-Manager and their respective affiliates; 
 the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its effect on the industries in which we target, including rising interest rates, inflationary pressures, recessionary concerns or global supply chain issues; 
 events or circumstances which undermine confidence in the financial markets or otherwise have a broad impact on financial markets, such as the sudden instability or collapse of large depository institutions or other significant corporations, terrorist attacks, natural or man-made disasters, pandemics such as the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic or threatened or actual armed conflicts; 
 the use, adequacy and availability of proceeds from our current public offering Follow-On Public Offering ), financing sources, working capital or borrowed money to finance a portion of our business strategy and to service our outstanding indebtedness; 
 the timing of cash flows, if any, from our businesses and other assets; 
 the ability of the Manager and the Sub-Manager to locate suitable acquisition opportunities for us and to manage and operate our businesses and other assets; 
 the ability of the Manager, the Sub-Manager and their respective affiliates to attract and retain highly talented professionals; 
 the ability to operate our business efficiently, manage costs (including general and administrative expenses) effectively and generate cash flow; 
 the lack of a public trading market for our limited liability company interests (our shares 
 the ability to make and the amount and timing of anticipated future distributions; 
 estimated net asset value per share of our shares; 
 the loss of our exemption from the definition of an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act 
 fiscal policies or inaction at the U.S. federal government level, which may lead to federal government shutdowns or negative impacts on the U.S economy; 
 the degree and nature of our competition; or 
 the effect of changes to government regulations, accounting rules or tax legislation. 
 Our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of our future performance and shareholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. While we believe our forward-looking statements are reasonable, such statements are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. As with any projection or forecast, forward-looking statements are necessarily dependent on assumptions, data and/or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise, and may not be realized. Our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our ability to control or accurately predict. 
 Important factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the factors listed and described under Risk Factors in the Company s prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) and dated April 11, 2022 (as supplemented to date, our prospectus and Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report.

Table of Contents 

 All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made; we undertake no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any obligation to, update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect new information, changed assumptions, the occurrence of subsequent events, or changes to future operating results over time unless otherwise required by law. 
 Risk Factor Summary 
 An investment in our shares involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks summarized in Item 1A. Risk Factors included in this report. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 We may be unable to successfully implement our business and acquisition strategies or generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our shareholders. 
 Our success will be dependent on the performance of the Manager and the Sub-Manager, but investors should not rely on the past performance of the Manager, the Sub-Manager and their respective affiliates as an indication of future success. Prior to the Initial Public Offering (defined below), affiliates of CNL have only sponsored real estate and credit investment programs. 
 We pay substantial fees and expenses to the Manager, the Sub-Manager, the Managing Dealer or their respective affiliates. These payments increase the risk that investors will not earn a profit on their investment. 
 Investors will not have the opportunity to evaluate the assets we acquire before we make them, which makes an investment in us more speculative. We face risks with respect to the evaluation and management of future acquisitions. 
 The shares sold in the Follow-On Public Offering will not be listed on an exchange or quoted through a national quotation system for the foreseeable future, if ever. Therefore, investors will have limited liquidity and may not receive a full return of their invested capital if investors sell their shares. 
 The purchase price for the shares in the Follow-On Public Offering is based on our most recently determined net asset value and is not based on any public trading market. While our board of directors has engaged an independent valuation firm to assist with the valuation of our businesses, the valuation of our assets is inherently subjective, and our net asset value may not accurately reflect the actual price at which our assets could be liquidated on any given day. 
 The amount of any distributions we may pay is uncertain. We may not be able to pay distributions and our distributions may not grow over time. We may pay distributions from any source, including from cash resulting from expense support and fee deferrals and/or waivers from the Manager and the Sub-Manager as needed, and there are no limits on the amount of offering proceeds we may use to fund distributions. If we pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, we will have less funds available for investments, and your overall return may be reduced. We believe the likelihood that we will pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations will be higher in the early stages of the Follow-On Public Offering. 
 The Manager, the Sub-Manager and their respective affiliates, including our officers and some of our directors, will face conflicts of interest including conflicts that may result from compensation arrangements with us and our affiliates, which could result in actions that are not in the best interests of our shareholders. 
 If we were to become taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would be required to pay income tax at corporate rates on our net income and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders. Such distributions, if any, by us to shareholders would constitute dividend income taxable to such shareholders, to the extent of our earnings and profits. 
 Our board of directors may change our business and acquisition policies and strategies without prior notice or shareholder approval, the effects of which may be adverse to you.

 Item 1. Business 
 General 
 CNL Strategic Capital, LLC (which is referred to in this report as we, our, us, our company or the Company is a limited liability company that primarily seeks to acquire and grow durable, middle-market U.S. businesses. We commenced operations on February 7, 2018. 
 We are externally managed by CNL Strategic Capital Management, LLC (the Manager ), an entity that is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act ). The Manager is controlled by CNL Financial Group, LLC, a private investment management firm specializing in alternative investment products. We have engaged the Manager under a management agreement, as currently amended and as may be amended in the future (the Management Agreement pursuant to which the Manager is responsible for the overall management of our activities. The Manager has engaged Levine Leichtman Strategic Capital, LLC (the Sub-Manager ), a registered investment adviser, under a sub-management agreement, as currently amended and as may be amended in the future (the Sub-Management Agreement ), pursuant to which the Sub-Manager is responsible for the day-to-day management of our assets. The Sub-Manager is an affiliate of Levine Leichtman Capital Partners, LLC. The Manager also provides us with certain administrative services (in such capacity, the Administrator under an administrative services agreement, as currently amended and as may be amended in the future (the Administrative Services Agreement ), with us. The Sub-Manager also provides certain other administrative services to us (in such capacity, the Sub-Administrator under a sub-administration agreement, as currently amended and as may be amended in the future (the Sub-Administration Agreement ), with the Manager. 
 The Manager and the Sub-Manager are collectively responsible for sourcing potential acquisitions and debt financing opportunities, subject to approval by the Manager s management committee that such opportunity meets our investment objectives and final approval of such opportunity by our board of directors, and monitoring and managing the businesses we acquire and/or finance on an ongoing basis. The Sub-Manager is primarily responsible for analyzing and conducting due diligence on prospective acquisitions and debt financings, as well as the overall structuring of transactions. 
 We refer to the strategy of owning both the debt and equity of our target private companies as a private capital strategy. We intend to target businesses that are highly cash flow generative, with annual revenues primarily between 15 million and 250 million and whose management teams seek an ownership stake in the company. Our business strategy is to acquire controlling equity interests in combination with debt positions and in doing so, provide long-term capital appreciation and current income while protecting invested capital. We seek to structure our investments with limited, if any, third-party senior leverage. 
 We intend for a significant majority of our total assets to be comprised of long-term controlling equity interests and debt positions in the businesses we acquire. In addition and to a lesser extent, we may acquire other debt and minority equity positions, which may include acquiring debt in the secondary market and minority equity interests in combination with other funds managed by the Sub-Manager from co-investments with other partnerships managed by the Sub-Manager or their affiliates. We expect that these positions will comprise a minority of our total assets. 
 Our target businesses are expected to fall within the following industries (without limitation): business services, consumer products, education, franchising, light manufacturing / specialty engineering, non-FDA regulated healthcare and safety companies. We do not intend to acquire businesses in industries that we believe are not stable or predictable, including oil and gas, commodities, high technology, internet and e-commerce. We also do not intend to acquire businesses that at the time of our acquisition are distressed or in the midst of a turnaround. 
 We intend to operate these businesses over a long-term basis with minimum holding period of four to six years. Actual holding periods for many of our businesses are expected to exceed this minimum holding period, but each business will be acquired with the expectation of an eventual exit transaction after a reasonable time frame to allow for the realization of shareholder appreciation. In limited circumstances in order to manage liquidity needs, meet other operating objectives or adapt to changing market conditions, we may also exit businesses prior to the expected minimum holding period. Exit decisions in relation to our businesses after the expiration of the minimum holding period will be made with the objective of maximizing shareholder value and allowing us to realize capital appreciation to the extent available from individual businesses. We will also assess the impact that any exit decision may have on our exclusion from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Potential exit transactions that we may pursue for our businesses include recapitalizations, public offerings, asset sales, mergers and other business combinations. In each case, in selecting the form of exit transaction we expect to assess prevailing market conditions, the timing and cost of implementation, whether we will be required to assume any post-transaction liabilities and other factors determined by the Manager and the Sub-Manager. No assurance can be given relating to the actual timing or impact of any exit transaction on our business. 
 We were formed as a Delaware limited liability company on August 9, 2016 and we intend to operate our business in a manner that will permit us to avoid registration under the Investment Company Act.

 Our Common Shares Offerings 
 Public Offerings 
 We commenced our initial public offering of up to 1.1 billion of shares on March 7, 2018 (the Initial Public Offering ), which included up to 100.0 million of shares being offered through our distribution reinvestment plan, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1, as amended (the Initial Registration Statement ). 
 On November 1, 2021, we commenced a follow-on public offering of up to 1.1 billion of shares of our shares (the Follow-On Public Offering and together with the Initial Public Offering, the Public Offerings ), which includes up to 100.0 million of shares being offered through our distribution reinvestment plan, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (the Follow-On Registration Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Upon commencement of the Follow-On Public Offering, the Initial Registration Statement was deemed terminated. Through the Follow-On Public Offering, we are offering, in any combination, four classes of shares: Class A shares, Class T shares, Class D shares and Class I shares (collectively, Non-founder shares ). There are differing selling fees and commissions for each share class. We also pay distribution and shareholder servicing fees, subject to certain limits, on the Class T and Class D shares sold in the Public Offerings (excluding sales pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan). 
 As of March 24, 2023, we had raised aggregate gross offering proceeds of approximately 518.9 million from the sale of common shares in the Public Offerings, including 17.2 million received through our distribution reinvestment plan. 
 Private Offerings 
 During the period from commencement of operations on February 7, 2018 to December 31, 2020, we offered Class FA Class FA and Class S Class S shares (collectively, the Founder shares through a combination of four private offerings (the Private Offerings and, together with the Public Offerings, the Offerings only to persons that were accredited investors, as that person is defined under the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act, and raised aggregate gross offering proceeds of approximately 177 million. We conducted each of the Private Offerings pursuant to the applicable exemption under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506(c) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. All of the Private Offerings were terminated on or before December 31, 2020. See our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for additional information related to our Private Offerings. 
 Since we commenced operations on February 7, 2018 and through March 24, 2023, we have raised total net offering proceeds (including amounts raised from our Private Offerings and Public Offerings) of approximately 685.9 million, including approximately 17.2 million received through our distribution reinvestment plan. For additional information on our Offerings, see Note 7. Capital Transactions in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 Portfolio and Investment Activity 
 Since we commenced operations in February 2018, we have acquired controlling equity interests in combination with debt positions in nine middle-market U.S. businesses, one of which was acquired in March 2023. We have also acquired non-controlling equity interests in combination with debt positions in three additional middle-market U.S. businesses. 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our portfolio company investments had a total fair value of 588.8 million (eleven portfolio companies) and 456.0 million (ten portfolio companies), respectively. Our portfolio company investments were diversified across nine industries and all of our debt investments featured fixed interest rates as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, we held investments in U.S. Treasury Bills with a total fair value of approximately 106.2 million as of December 31, 2022. We did not invest in U.S. Treasury Bills during the year ended December 31, 2021. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis Portfolio and Investment Activity and Note 3. Investments in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information related to our investment portfolio. 
 One of our portfolio companies exceeded 20 significance under Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X Rule 3-09 for the year ended December 31, 2021. None of our portfolio companies exceeded 20 significance under Rule 3-09 for the year ended December 31, 2022. See Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules for financial statements of our significant portfolio company, as defined by Rule 3-09. 
 Our portfolio companies are required to make monthly interest payments on their debt, with the debt principal due upon maturity. Failure of any of these portfolio companies to pay contractual interest payments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operations which would impact our ability to make distributions to shareholders.

 Borrowings 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had the ability to borrow up to 50.0 million under a line of credit. We had not borrowed any amounts under the line of credit during the year ended or as of December 31, 2022. See Note 8. Borrowings in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information related to our borrowings. 
 We will not use leverage in excess of 35 of our gross assets (for which calculation borrowings of our businesses are not included) unless a majority of our independent directors approves any excess above such limit and determines that such borrowing is in the best interests of our company. Any excess in leverage over such 35 limit shall be disclosed to shareholders in our next quarterly or annual report, along with the reason for such excess. In any event, we expect that the amount of our aggregate borrowings will be reasonable in relation to the value of our assets and will be reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly. 
 Financing a portion of the acquisition price of our assets will allow us to broaden our business by increasing the funds available for acquisition. Financing a portion of our acquisitions is not free from risk. Using borrowings requires us to pay interest and principal, referred to as debt service, all of which decrease the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders or other purposes. We may also be unable to refinance the borrowings at maturity on favorable or equivalent terms, if at all, exposing us to the potential risk of loss with respect to assets pledged as collateral for loans. Certain of our borrowings may be floating rate and the effective interest rates on such borrowings will increase when the relevant interest benchmark increases. 
 Competition 
 We compete for acquisitions with strategic buyers, private equity funds and diversified holding companies. Additionally, we may compete for loans with traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks. Certain competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have access to funding sources that are not available to us, and others may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments. 
 However, we believe we provide a unique capital solution to sellers and operating management teams that is not widely available in the market, if at all. We believe we are able to be competitive with these entities primarily due to our focus on established middle-market U.S. companies, the ability of the Manager and the Sub-Manager to source proprietary transactions, and our unique business strategy that offers business owners a flexible capital structure and is a more attractive alternative when they require investment capital to meet their ongoing business needs. Further, we believe regulatory changes, including the adoption of the Dodd-Frank Act and the introduction of the international capital and liquidity requirements under the Basel III Accords Basel III have caused some of our potential competitors to curtail their lending to middle-market U.S. companies as a result of the greater regulatory risk and expense involved in lending to the sector. 
 Human Capital Resources 
 We are externally managed and as such we do not have any employees. All of our executive officers are employees of the Manager or one or more of its affiliates. The Manager has reported to us that it generally strives to have a diverse group of candidates to consider for roles. In addition, the Manager has reported that it maintains a variety of development, health and wellness and charitable programs for its personnel, including those who provide services to us. 
 Tax Status 
 We believe that we are properly characterized as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and expect to continue to qualify as a partnership, and not be treated as a publicly traded partnership or otherwise be treated as a taxable corporation, for such purposes. As a partnership, we are generally not subject to U.S. federal and state income tax at the entity level. However, the Company holds certain equity investments in taxable subsidiaries (the Taxable Subsidiaries ). The Taxable Subsidiaries permit the Company to hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are pass through entities for tax purposes. The Taxable Subsidiaries are not consolidated with the Company for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, benefit, and the related tax assets and liabilities, as a result of the Taxable Subsidiaries ownership of certain investments. The income tax expense, or benefit, and related tax assets and liabilities are reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 Corporate Information 
 Our executive offices are located at 450 South Orange Avenue, Orlando, Florida 32801, and our telephone number is 407-650-1000.

In the event we adjust the offering price after an investor submits their subscription agreement and before the date we accept such subscription, such investor will not be provided with direct notice by us of the adjusted offering price but will need to check our website or our filings with the SEC prior to the closing date of their subscription. In this case, an investor will have at least five business days after we publish the adjusted offering price to consider whether to withdraw their subscription request before they are committed to purchase shares upon our acceptance. 
 Investors will not have the opportunity to evaluate the assets we acquire before we make them, which makes an investment in us more speculative. 
 We are not able to provide investors with information to evaluate the economic merit of the acquisitions we intend to make prior to our making them and investors will be relying entirely on the ability of the Manager, the Sub-Manager and our board of directors to select or approve, as the case may be, such acquisitions. Future opportunities may include the acquisition of businesses that are currently owned and/or controlled by the Sub-Manager or its affiliates. In connection with any acquisition of a business that involves the Sub-Manager or its affiliates (excluding co-investment opportunities acquired directly from third parties other than the Sub-Manager or its affiliates), we would seek a valuation from a third-party valuation firm, and such acquisition would be subject to approval of a majority of our independent directors. 
 Additionally, the Manager and the Sub-Manager, subject to oversight by our board of directors, have broad discretion to review, approve, and oversee our business and acquisition policies, to evaluate our acquisition opportunities and to structure the terms of such acquisitions and investors will not be able to evaluate the transaction terms or other financial or operational data concerning such acquisitions. Because of these factors, the Follow-On Public Offering may entail more risk than other types of offerings. Our board of directors has also delegated broad discretion to both of the Manager and Sub-Manager to implement our business and acquisitions strategies, which includes delegation of the duty to approve certain decisions consistent with the business and acquisition policies approved by our board, our board s fiduciary duties and securities laws. This additional risk may hinder investors ability to achieve their own personal investment objectives related to portfolio diversification, risk-adjusted returns and other objectives.

 The Follow-On Public Offering is a best efforts offering and if we are unable to raise substantial funds, we will be limited in the number and type of acquisitions we may make, and the value of an investment in us will fluctuate with the performance of the assets we acquire. 
 The Follow-On Public Offering is a best efforts, as opposed to a firm commitment offering. This means that the Managing Dealer is not obligated to purchase any shares, but has only agreed to use its best efforts to sell the shares to investors. As a result, if we are unable to raise substantial funds, we will make fewer acquisitions resulting in less diversification in terms of the number of assets owned and the types of assets that we acquire. 
 Participating broker-dealers in the Follow-On Public Offering are required to comply with Regulation Best Interest, which enhances the broker-dealer standard of conduct beyond current suitability obligations and requires participating broker-dealers in the Follow-On Public Offering to act in the best interest of each investor when making a recommendation to purchase shares in the Follow-On Public Offering, without placing their financial or other interest ahead of the investor s interests. The application of this enhanced standard of conduct may impact whether a broker-dealer recommends our shares for investment and consequently may adversely affect our ability to raise substantial funds in the Follow-On Public Offering. In particular, under SEC guidance concerning Regulation Best Interest, a broker-dealer recommending an investment in our shares should consider a number of factors under the duty of care obligation of Regulation Best Interest, including but not limited to cost and complexity of the investment and reasonably available alternatives, which alternatives are likely to exist, may be less costly or have a lower investment risk, in determining whether there is a reasonable basis for the recommendation. As a result, high cost, high risk and complex products may be subject to greater scrutiny by broker-dealers. Broker-dealers may recommend a more costly or complex product as long as they have a reasonable basis to believe is in the best interest of a particular retail customer. However, if broker-dealers choose alternatives to our shares, many of which likely exist, such as an investment in listed entities, which may be a reasonable alternative to an investment in us as such investments may feature characteristics like lower cost, nominal commissions at the time of initial purchase, less complexity and lesser or different risks, our ability to raise capital will be adversely affected. If Regulation Best Interest reduces our ability to raise capital in the Follow-On Public Offering, it would also harm our ability to create a diversified portfolio of investments and ability to achieve our objectives. 
 In such event, the likelihood of our profitability being affected by the performance of any one of our assets will increase. An investment in our shares will be subject to greater risk to the extent that we lack asset diversification. In addition, our inability to raise substantial funds would increase our fixed operating expenses as a percentage of gross income, and our financial condition and ability to pay distributions could be adversely affected. 
 Investors should not assume that we will sell the maximum offering amount of the Follow-On Public Offering, or any other particular offering amount in the Follow-On Public Offering. 
 The shares sold in the Follow-On Public Offering will not be listed on an exchange or quoted through a national quotation system for the foreseeable future, if ever. Therefore, investors in the Follow-On Public Offering will have limited liquidity and may not receive a full return of their invested capital if investors sell their shares. 
 The shares offered by us are illiquid assets for which there is not expected to be any secondary market nor is it expected that any will develop in the future. The ability to transfer shares is limited. Pursuant to our fifth amended and restated limited liability company agreement, as currently amended and as may be amended in the future (our LLC Agreement ), we have the discretion under certain circumstances to prohibit transfers of shares, or to refuse to consent to the admission of a transferee as a shareholder. We have adopted a share repurchase program to conduct quarterly share repurchases but only a limited number of shares are eligible for repurchase. Moreover, investors should not rely on our share repurchase program as a method to sell shares promptly because our share repurchase program includes numerous restrictions that limit their ability to sell their shares to us, and our board of directors may amend or suspend our share repurchase program upon 30 days prior notice to our shareholders if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in our best interest and the best interest of our shareholders, such as when repurchase requests would place an undue burden on our liquidity, adversely affect our operations, risk having an adverse impact on us that would outweigh the benefit of repurchasing our shares or risk our ability to qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Upon suspension of our share repurchase program, our share repurchase program requires our board of directors to consider at least quarterly whether the continued suspension of the plan is in our best interest and the best interest of our shareholders; however, we are not required to authorize the recommencement of the share repurchase program within any specified period of time. Our board of directors cannot terminate our share repurchase program absent a liquidity event or where otherwise required by law. In such an event, we will notify our shareholders of such developments in a current report on Form 8-K or in our annual or quarterly reports, which will be posted on our website, and will also provide a separate communication to our shareholders.

 At the discretion of our board of directors, we may use cash on hand, including offering proceeds, cash available from borrowings, and cash from the sale of assets as of the end of the applicable period to repurchase shares. Our share repurchase program also limits the total amount of aggregate repurchases of Class FA, Class A, Class T, Class D, Class I and Class S shares to up to 2.5 of our aggregate net asset value per calendar quarter (based on the aggregate net asset value as of the last date of the month immediately prior to the repurchase date) and up to 10 of our aggregate net asset value per year (based on the average aggregate net asset value as of the end of each of our trailing four quarters). The timing, amount and terms of our share repurchase program will include certain restrictions intended to maintain our ability to qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore, it will be difficult for investors to sell their shares promptly or at all. If investors are able to sell their shares, investors may only be able to sell them at a substantial discount for the price they paid. Investor suitability standards imposed by certain states may also make it more difficult to sell their shares to someone in those states. The shares should be purchased as a long-term investment only. 
 Our board of directors intends to contemplate a liquidity event for our shareholders on or before November 1, 2027 (which is within six years from the date we terminated the Initial Public Offering); however, our board of directors is under no obligation to pursue or complete any particular liquidity event during this timeframe or otherwise. We expect that our board of directors, in the exercise of its fiduciary duty to our shareholders, will decide to pursue a liquidity event when it believes that then-current market conditions are favorable for a liquidity event, and that such an event is in the best interests of our shareholders. There can be no assurance that a suitable transaction will be available or that market conditions for a transaction will be favorable during that timeframe. A liquidity event could include, among other transactions: (i) a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, either on a complete portfolio basis or individually, followed by a liquidation; (ii) subject to an affirmative vote of a two-thirds (2/3) super-majority of our outstanding shares, a decision to continue as a perpetual-life company with a self-tender offer for a minimum of twenty-five percent (25 of our outstanding shares; (iii) a merger or other transaction approved by our board of directors in which our shareholders will receive cash or shares of another publicly traded company; or (iv) a listing of our shares on a national securities exchange or a quotation through a national quotation system. However, there can be no assurance that we will complete a liquidity event within such time or at all. 
 If a liquidity event does not occur, shareholders may have to hold their shares for an extended period of time, or indefinitely. In making a determination of what type of liquidity event is in the best interest of our shareholders, our board of directors, including our independent directors, may consider a variety of criteria, including, but not limited to, asset diversification and performance, our financial condition, potential access to capital as a listed company, market conditions for the sale of our assets or listing of our shares, internal management requirements to become a perpetual life company and the potential for investor liquidity. Notwithstanding the shareholder approval requirement in connection with a determination to continue as a perpetual-life company as discussed above in (ii), nothing shall prevent our board of directors from exercising its fiduciary duty on behalf of our company and our shareholders, including any limitation on our board of directors to conduct self-tender offers or seek shareholder approval through multiple proxy attempts. 
 Under our share repurchase program, our ability to make new acquisitions of businesses or increase the current distribution rate may become limited if, during any consecutive two-year period, we do not have at least one quarter in which we fully satisfy 100 of properly submitted repurchase requests, which may adversely affect our flexibility and our ability to achieve our investment objectives. 
 If, during any consecutive two year period, we do not have at least one quarter in which we fully satisfy 100 of properly submitted repurchase requests, we will not make any new acquisitions of businesses (excluding short-term cash management investments under 90 days in duration) and we will use all available investable assets (as defined below) to satisfy repurchase requests (subject to the limitations under our share repurchase program) until all outstanding repurchase requests Unfulfilled Repurchase Requests have been satisfied. Additionally, during such time as there remains any requests under our share repurchase plan outstanding from such period, the Manager and the Sub-Manager will defer their total return incentive fee until all such Unfulfilled Repurchase Requests have been satisfied. If triggered, this requirement may prevent us from pursuing potentially accretive investment opportunities and may keep us from fully realizing our investment objectives. In addition, this requirement may limit our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders. Investable assets includes net proceeds from new subscription agreements, unrestricted cash, proceeds from marketable securities, proceeds from the distribution reinvestment plan, and net cash flows after any payment, accrual, allocation, or liquidity reserves or other business costs in the normal course of owning, operating or selling our acquired businesses, debt service, repayment of debt, debt financing costs, current or anticipated debt covenants, funding commitments related to our businesses, customary general and administrative expenses, customary organizational and offering costs, asset management and advisory fees, performance or actions under existing contracts, obligations under our organizational documents or those of our subsidiaries, obligations imposed by law, regulations, courts or arbitration, or distributions or establishment of an adequate liquidity reserve as determined by our board of directors.

 The ongoing offering price may not accurately reflect the value of our assets. 
 Our board of directors determines our net asset value for each class of our shares on a monthly basis. If our net asset value per share on such valuation date increases above or decreases below our net proceeds per share as stated in our prospectus, we will adjust the offering price of any of the classes of our shares, effective five business days after such determination is published, to ensure that no share is sold at a price, after deduction of upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees, that is above or below our net asset value per share on such valuation date. Ongoing offering prices for the shares in the Follow-On Public Offering will take into consideration other factors such as selling commissions, dealer manager fees, distribution and shareholder servicing fees and organization and offering expenses so the offering price will not be the equivalent of the value of our assets. 
 Valuations and appraisals of our assets are estimates of fair value and may not necessarily correspond to realizable value. 
 Our board of directors, with assistance from the Manager and the Sub-Manager, is ultimately responsible for determining in good faith the fair value of our assets for which market prices are not readily available. Our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors and our audit committee, has adopted a valuation policy that provides for methodologies to be used to determine the fair value of our assets for purposes of our net asset value calculation. Our board of directors makes this determination on a monthly basis, and any other time when a decision is required regarding the fair value of our assets. Our board of directors has retained an independent valuation firm to assist the Manager and the Sub-Manager in preparing their recommendations with respect to our board of directors determination of the fair values of assets for which market prices are not readily available. However, it may be difficult to reflect fully and accurately rapidly changing market conditions or material events that may impact the value of assets or liabilities between valuations, or to obtain quickly complete information regarding any such events. As a result, the net asset value per share may not reflect a material event until such time as sufficient information is available and analyzed, and the financial impact is fully evaluated, such that our net asset value may be appropriately adjusted in accordance with our valuation procedures. 
 Within the parameters of our valuation procedures, the valuation methodologies used to value our assets involves subjective judgments and projections and may not be accurate. Valuation methodologies also involve assumptions and opinions about future events, which may or may not turn out to be correct. Valuations of our assets are only estimates of fair value. Ultimate realization of the value of an asset depends to a great extent on economic, market and other conditions beyond our control and the control of the Manager, the Sub-Manager and the independent valuation firm. Further, valuations do not necessarily represent the price at which an asset would sell, since market prices of assets can only be determined by negotiation between a willing buyer and seller. As such, the carrying value of an asset may not reflect the price at which the asset could be sold in the market, and the difference between carrying value and the ultimate sales price could be material. In addition, accurate valuations are more difficult to obtain in times of low transaction volume because there are fewer market transactions that can be considered in the context of the valuation. The determinations of fair value by our board of directors may differ materially from the values that would have been used if an active market and market prices existed for these assets. Furthermore, through the valuation process, our board of directors may determine that the fair value of our assets that differs materially from the values that were provided by the independent valuation firm. There will be no retroactive adjustment in the valuation of such assets, the offering price of our shares, the price we paid to repurchase shares or net asset value-based fees we paid to the Manager, the Sub-Manager or the Managing Dealer to the extent such valuations prove to not accurately reflect the realizable value of our assets. Because the price investors will pay for our shares in the Follow-On Public Offering, and the price at which their shares may be repurchased by us pursuant to our share repurchase program are generally based on our most recently determined net asset value per share, they may pay more than realizable value or receive less than realizable value for their investment. 
 Our net asset value per share may change materially if the valuations of our assets materially change from prior valuations or the actual operating results for a particular month differ from what we originally budgeted for that month. 
 When the valuations of our assets are reflected in our net asset value calculations, there may be a material change in our net asset value per share for each class of our shares from those previously reported. In addition, actual operating results for a given month may differ from what we originally budgeted for that month, which may cause a material increase or decrease in the net asset value per share. We will not retroactively adjust the net asset value per share of each class of shares reported for the previous month. Therefore, because a new monthly valuation may differ materially from the prior valuation or the actual results from operations may be better or worse than what we previously budgeted, the adjustment to reflect the new valuation or actual operating results may cause the net asset value per share for each class of our shares to increase or decrease, and such increase or decrease will occur on the day the adjustment is made.

 The amount of any distributions we may pay is uncertain. We may not be able to pay investors distributions and our distributions may not grow over time. 
 Subject to our board of directors discretion and applicable legal restrictions, our board of directors has declared, and intends to continue to declare cash distributions to shareholders. We intend to pay these distributions to our shareholders out of assets legally available for distribution. We cannot assure investors that we will achieve operating results that will allow us to make a targeted level of cash distributions or year-to-year increases in cash distributions. Our ability to pay distributions might be adversely affected by, among other things, the impact of the risks described in our prospectus. All distributions will be paid at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, our financial condition, compliance with applicable regulations and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. We cannot assure investors that we will pay distributions to our shareholders in the future. 
 We may pay all or a substantial portion of our distributions from various sources of funds available to us, including from expense support from the Manager and the Sub-Manager, borrowings, the offering proceeds and other sources, without limitation. In the early stages of our company, we are likely to pay some, if not all, of our distributions from offering proceeds, borrowings, or from other sources, including cash resulting from expense support from the Manager and the Sub-Manager pursuant to an expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement (the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement ). For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, and 2018 distributions were paid from multiple sources and these sources included net investment income before expense support (reimbursement) of 76.3 , 65.2 , 42.3 , 61.7 , and 85.2 , reimbursable expense support of 0.0 , 0.0 , 33.2 , 23.5 and 11.1 , and offering proceeds of 23.7 , 34.8 , 24.5 , 14.8 and 3.7 , respectively. The Company will be required to repay expense support to the Manager and Sub-Manager in future periods which may reduce future income available for distributions. If we fund distributions from financings, then such financings will need to be repaid, and if we fund distributions from offering proceeds, then we will have fewer funds available for business opportunities, which may affect our ability to generate future cash flows from operations and, therefore, reduce their overall return. In addition, if we fund distributions from borrowings, or other sources like expense support from the Manager and Sub-Manager, such sources may result in a liability to us which would cause our net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would if we had not borrowed or used expense support to fund our distributions, which would negatively affect the price per share of our shares. We cannot predict when distribution payments sourced from debt and from proceeds will occur, and an extended period of such payments would likely be unsustainable. 
 Distributions on the Non-founder shares will likely be lower than distributions on Class FA shares because we are required to pay higher management and incentive fees to the Manager and the Sub-Manager with respect to the Non-founder shares. Additionally, distributions paid to our shareholders of share classes with ongoing distribution and shareholder servicing fees may be lower than distributions on certain other of our classes without such ongoing distributions and shareholder servicing fees that we are required to pay. We also believe the likelihood that distributions will be paid from sources other than cash flow from operations may be higher in the early stages of the offering. These risks will be greater for persons who acquire our shares relatively early in the Public Offerings, before a significant portion of the offering proceeds have been deployed. Accordingly, shareholders who receive the payment of a distribution from us should not assume that such distribution is the result of a net profit earned by us. 
 Because the Managing Dealer is an affiliate of the Manager, investors will not have the benefit of an independent review of the Follow-On Public Offering or us customarily performed in underwritten offerings. 
 The Managing Dealer, CNL Securities Corp., is an affiliate of the Manager, and will not make an independent review of us or the Follow-On Public Offering. Accordingly, investors will have to rely on their own broker-dealer or distribution intermediary to make an independent review of the terms of the Follow-On Public Offering. If an investor s broker-dealer or distribution intermediary does not conduct such a review, they will not have the benefit of an independent review of the terms of the Follow-On Public Offering. Further, the due diligence investigation of us by the Managing Dealer cannot be considered to be an independent review and, therefore, may not be as meaningful as a review conducted by an unaffiliated broker-dealer or investment banker. In addition, we do not, and do not expect to, have research analysts reviewing our performance or our securities on an ongoing basis. Therefore, investors will not have an independent review of our performance and the value of our shares relative to publicly traded companies.

 We may be unable to use a significant portion of the net proceeds of the Follow-On Public Offering on acceptable terms in the timeframe contemplated by the prospectus relating to the Follow-On Public Offering. 
 Delays in using the net proceeds of the Follow-On Public Offering may impair our performance. We cannot assure an investor that we will be able to identify any acquisition opportunities in a manner consistent with our business strategy or that any acquisition that we make will produce a positive return. We may be unable to use the net proceeds of the Follow-On Public Offering on acceptable terms within the time period that we anticipate or at all, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. 
 Before we have raised sufficient funds to deploy the proceeds of the Follow-On Public Offering in acquisitions that are consistent with our business strategy, we will deploy the net proceeds of the Follow-On Public Offering primarily in cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements, certain leveraged loans and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of acquisition, which we expect to produce returns that are significantly lower than the returns which we expect to achieve in relation to the businesses and other assets we will seek to acquire. At times, cash invested in these temporary investments may be significant, particularly at times when we are receiving high amounts of offering proceeds and/or times when there are few attractive investment opportunities. In the event we are unable to find suitable investments, such cash may be maintained for longer periods which would be dilutive to overall investment returns. This could cause a substantial delay in the time it takes for your investment to realize its full potential return and could adversely affect our ability to pay regular distributions of cash net investment income. As of December 31, 2022, we had invested in U.S. Treasury Bills with a fair value of 106.2 million and are seeking investment opportunities consistent with our investment objectives to deploy our capital. In the event we fail to timely invest the net proceeds of the Follow-On Public Offering, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
 Investors interest in us will be diluted if we issue additional shares, which could reduce the overall value of the investment. 
 Potential investors in the Follow-On Public Offering do not have preemptive rights to any shares we issue in the future. Our LLC Agreement authorizes us to issue 1,000,000,000 shares. Pursuant to our LLC Agreement, a majority of our entire board of directors may amend our LLC Agreement from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of authorized shares of any class or series without shareholder approval. After an investor s purchase in the Follow-On Public Offering, our board of directors may elect to sell additional shares in this or future public offerings, issue equity interests in private offerings or issue share-based awards to our independent directors, the Manager, the Sub-Manager and/or employees of the Manager or the Sub-Manager. To the extent we issue additional equity interests after an investor s purchase in the Follow-On Public Offering, their percentage ownership interest in us will be diluted. In addition, depending upon the terms and pricing of any additional offerings and the value of our assets, an investor may also experience dilution in the net asset value and fair value of their shares. 
 Investors will experience substantial dilution in the net tangible book value of their shares equal to the offering costs and sales load associated with their shares and will encounter substantial on-going fees and expenses. 
 If investors purchase our shares in the Follow-On Public Offering, there are substantial fees and expenses which will be borne by the investor initially and ongoing as an investor. Also, investors will incur immediate dilution in the net tangible book value of their shares equal to the offering costs and the sales load associated with their shares. There are also certain offering costs associated with the shares in the Follow-On Public Offering, which will be reimbursed to the Manager and the Sub-Manager. This means that the investors who purchase shares will pay a price per share that substantially exceeds the per share value of our assets after subtracting our liabilities.

 We are an emerging growth company under the federal securities laws and will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and therefore are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from, or reduced disclosure obligations relating to, various reporting requirements that normally are applicable to public companies. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to (i) comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes pursuant to the say on frequency and say on pay provisions of Section 14A(a) of the Exchange Act (requiring a non-binding stockholder vote to approve compensation of certain executive officers) and the say on golden parachute provisions of Section 14A(b) of the Exchange Act (requiring a non-binding stockholder vote to approve golden parachute arrangements for certain executive officers in connection with mergers and certain other business combinations), (iii) disclose more than two years of audited financial statements in a registration statement filed with the SEC, (iv) disclose selected financial data pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities Act (requiring selected financial data for the past five years or for the life of the issuer, if less than five years) in our periodic reports filed with the SEC for any period prior to the earliest audited period presented in this registration statement, and (v) disclose certain executive compensation related items, such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer s compensation to median employee compensation as required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Once we are no longer an emerging growth company, because we are not a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer under the Exchange Act, and will not be so long as our shares are not traded on a securities exchange, we are not subject to the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, because we have no employees, we do not have any executive compensation or golden parachute payments to report in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our shares less attractive because we choose to rely on any of the exemptions discussed above. 
 Additionally, under Section 107 of the JOBS Act, an emerging growth company may take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This means an emerging growth company can delay adopting certain accounting standards until such standards are otherwise applicable to private companies. However, we are electing to opt out of such extended transition period, and therefore will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the applicable dates on which the adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. This election is irrevocable. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, although we will lose that status sooner if our annual gross revenues exceed 1.235 billion, if we issue more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period, or if we become a large accelerated filer under the Exchange Act, which we will not be so long as our shares are not traded on a securities exchange. 
 Our business could be adversely affected if we fail to maintain our qualification as a venture capital operating company, or VCOC, under the Plan Asset Regulation. 
 We used a substantial portion of the net proceeds from the Private Offerings to acquire our businesses and we currently operate our business in a manner so that it is intended to qualify as a venture capital operating company VCOC under the U.S. Department of Labor regulation at 29 C.F.R. 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ERISA (the Plan Asset Regulation ), and therefore are not subject to the fiduciary requirements with respect to our assets. However, if we fail to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a VCOC for any reason and no other exception under the Plan Asset Regulation applies, such failure could materially interfere with our activities or expose us to risks related to our failure to comply with the requirements and the fiduciary responsibility standards of ERISA would apply to us, including the requirement of investment prudence and diversification, and certain transactions that we enter into, or may have entered into, in the ordinary course of business, might constitute or result in non-exempt prohibited transactions under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). A non-exempt prohibited transaction, in addition to imposing potential fiduciary liabilities may also result in the imposition of an excise tax under the Code upon a party in interest (as defined in Section 3(14) of ERISA) or disqualified person (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code) with whom we engaged in the transaction. Therefore, our business could be adversely affected if we fail to quality as a VCOC under the Plan Asset Regulation.

 Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure 
 We may be unable to successfully implement our business and acquisition strategies or generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our shareholders. 
 We are subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business, including the risk that we will be unable to implement and execute our business strategy as described in our prospectus and that the value of our shares could decline substantially and, as a result, investors may lose part or all of their investment. Our financial condition and results of operations will depend on many factors including the availability of acquisition opportunities, readily accessible short and long-term financing, financial markets and economic conditions generally and the performance of the Manager and the Sub-Manager. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow over time to pay our operating expenses and make distributions to shareholders. 
 Our ability to implement and execute our business strategy depends on the Manager s and the Sub-Manager s ability to manage and support our business operations. If the Manager or the Sub-Manager were to lose any members of their respective senior management teams, our ability to implement and execute our business strategy could be significantly harmed. 
 We have no internal management capacity or employees other than our appointed executive officers and will be dependent on the diligence, skill and network of business contacts of the Manager s and the Sub-Manager s senior management teams to implement and execute our business strategy. We also depend, to a significant extent, on the Manager s and the Sub-Manager s access to its investment professionals and the information and deal flow generated by these professionals. The Manager s and the Sub-Manager s senior management teams will evaluate, negotiate, structure, close, and monitor the assets we acquire. The departure of any of the Manager s or the Sub-Manager s senior management teams could have a material adverse effect on our ability to implement and execute our business strategy. We do not anticipate maintaining any key person insurance on any of the Manager s or the Sub-Manager s senior management teams. 
 Our board of directors may change our business and acquisition policies and strategies without prior notice or shareholder approval, the effects of which may be adverse to investors. 
 Our board of directors has the authority to modify or waive our current business and acquisition policies, criteria and strategies without prior notice and without shareholder approval. In such event, we will promptly file a prospectus supplement and a current report on Form 8-K, disclosing any such modification or waiver. We cannot predict the effect any changes to our current business and acquisition policies, criteria and strategies would have on our business, operating results and value of our shares. However, the effects might be adverse, which could negatively impact our ability to pay investors distributions and cause investors to lose all or part of their investment. Moreover, we will have significant flexibility in deploying the net proceeds of the Follow-On Public Offering and may use the net proceeds from the Follow-On Public Offering in ways with which investors may not agree or for purposes other than those contemplated at the time of the Follow-On Public Offering. 
 If we internalize our management functions, investors interest in us could be diluted, and we could incur other significant costs and face other significant risks associated with being self-managed. 
 Our board of directors may decide in the future to internalize our management functions. If we do so, we may elect to negotiate to acquire the Manager s or the Sub-Manager s assets and personnel. At this time, we cannot anticipate the form or amount of consideration or other terms relating to any such internalization transaction. Such consideration could take many forms, including cash payments, promissory notes and shares. The payment of such consideration could result in dilution of an investor s interests as a shareholder and could reduce the earnings per share attributable to their investment. 
 In addition, while we would no longer bear the costs of the various fees and expenses we expect to pay to the Manager under the Management Agreement (50 of which is paid to the Sub-Manager under the Sub-Management Agreement), we would incur the compensation and benefits as well as the costs of our officers and other employees and consultants that we now expect will be paid by the Manager, the Sub-Manager or their respective affiliates. In addition, we may issue equity awards to officers and consultants, which awards would decrease net income and may further dilute an investor s investment. We cannot reasonably estimate the amount of fees we would save or the costs we would incur if we became self-managed. If the expenses we assume as a result of internalization are higher than the expenses we avoid paying to the Manager and the Sub-Manager, our earnings per share would be lower as a result of the internalization than they otherwise would have been, potentially decreasing the amount of funds available to distribute to our shareholders and the value of our shares. As currently organized, we do not expect to have any employees. If we elect to internalize our operations, we would employ personnel and would be subject to potential liabilities commonly faced by employers, such as workers disability and compensation claims, potential labor disputes and other employee-related liabilities and grievances.

 If we internalize our management functions, we could have difficulty integrating these functions as a stand-alone entity. In addition, we could have difficulty retaining such personnel employed by us. We expect individuals employed by the Manager and the Sub-Manager to perform asset management and general and administrative functions, including accounting and financial reporting for us. These personnel have a great deal of know-how and experience. We may fail to properly identify the appropriate mix of personnel and capital needs to operate as a stand-alone entity. An inability to manage an internalization transaction effectively could result in our incurring excess costs and/or suffering deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting. Such deficiencies could cause us to incur additional costs, and our management s attention could be diverted from most effectively managing our assets. 
 In some cases, internalization transactions involving the acquisition of a manager have resulted in litigation. If we were to become involved in such litigation in connection with an internalization of our management functions, we could be forced to spend significant amounts of money defending ourselves in such litigation, regardless of the merit of the claims against us, which would reduce the amount of funds available to acquire additional assets or make distributions to our shareholders. 
 Anti-takeover provisions in our LLC Agreement could inhibit a change in control. 
 Provisions in our LLC Agreement may make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our shares. Under our LLC Agreement, our shares have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and therefore have limited ability to influence management s decisions regarding our business. In addition, our LLC Agreement contains a number of provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or may discourage a third party from acquiring control of the company. These provisions include: 
 restrictions on our ability to enter into certain transactions with major holders of our shares modeled on the limitation contained in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL; 
 allowing only the company s board of directors to fill vacancies, including newly created directorships; 
 requiring that directors may be removed, with or without cause, only by a vote of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares; 
 requiring advance notice for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by holders of our shares at a meeting of shareholders; 
 permitting each of the Manager and Sub-Manager, respectively, to initially appoint a non-independent director and, thereafter, to nominate such non-independent director s replacement upon such non-independent director s failure to stand for re-election, resignation, removal from office, death or incapacity; 
 our ability to issue additional securities, including securities that may have preferences or are otherwise senior in priority to our shares; and 
 limitations on the ability of our shareholders to call special meetings of the shareholders. 
 We may have conflicts of interest with the noncontrolling shareholders of our businesses. 
 The boards of directors of the businesses we acquire controlling interests in will have fiduciary duties to all their shareholders, including the company and noncontrolling shareholders. As a result, they may make decisions that are in the best interests of their shareholders generally but which are not necessarily in the best interest of the company or our shareholders. In dealings with the company, the directors of these businesses may have conflicts of interest and decisions may have to be made without the participation of directors appointed by us, and such decisions may be different from those that we would make.

 An investor s investment return may be reduced if we are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 
 We are organized as a holding company that conducts its business primarily through its wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. We conduct and intend to continue to conduct our operations so that the company and each of its subsidiaries do not fall within, or are excluded from the definition of an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act, a company is deemed to be an investment company if it is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. We believe that we are not to be considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act because we do not and will not engage primarily or hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, we have and continue to intend to acquire stable and growing middle-market U.S. businesses with a focus on business services, consumer products, education, franchising, light manufacturing / specialty engineering, non-FDA regulated healthcare and safety companies. In addition, through the Manager and the Sub-Manager, we have been and intend to continue to be engaged with the acquired businesses in several areas, including (i) strategic direction and planning, (ii) supporting add-on acquisitions and introducing senior management to new business contacts, (iii) balance sheet management, (iv) capital markets strategies, and (v) optimization of working capital. We monitor the critical success factors of our acquired businesses on a daily/weekly basis and meet monthly with senior management of the companies we acquire in an operating committee environment to discuss their respective strategic, financial and operating performance. As a consequence, we primarily engage and hold ourselves out as being primarily engaged in the non-investment company businesses of these companies, which are or will become our wholly- or majority-owned subsidiaries. 
 Under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act, a company is deemed to be an investment company if it is engaged, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40 of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis, which we refer to as the 40 test. Excluded from the term investment securities, among other instruments, are U.S. Government securities and securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exceptions under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. 
 We conduct operations, and intend to continue to conduct our operations, so that on an unconsolidated basis we and most of our subsidiaries will comply with the 40 test and no more than 40 of the assets of those subsidiaries will consist of investment securities. We expect that most, if not all, of our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries will fall outside the definitions of investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) and Section 3(a)(1)(C) or rely on an exception or exemption from the definition of investment company other than the exceptions under Section 3(c)(1) and Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. Consequently, interests in these subsidiaries (which currently constitute and are expected to continue to constitute most, if not all, of our assets) generally will not constitute investment securities for purposes of Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act. Accordingly, we believe that we are not considered and will not be considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act. We monitor our holdings on an ongoing basis and in connection with each of our business acquisitions to determine compliance with the 40 test. 
 The determination of whether an entity is our majority-owned subsidiary is made by us. Under the Investment Company Act, a majority-owned subsidiary of a person means a company 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of which are owned by such person, or by another company which is a majority-owned subsidiary of such person. The Investment Company Act further defines voting securities as any security presently entitling the owner or holder thereof to vote for the election of directors of a company. We treat companies in which we own at least a majority of the outstanding voting securities as majority-owned subsidiaries for purposes of the 40 test. We have not requested the SEC to approve our treatment of any company as a majority-owned subsidiary and the SEC has not done so. If the SEC, or its staff, were to disagree with our treatment of one of more companies as majority-owned subsidiaries, we would need to adjust our strategy and our assets in order to continue to pass the 40 test. Any such adjustment in our strategy could have a material adverse effect on us.

 Additionally, we conduct and intend to continue to conduct operations so that we are not treated as a special situation investment company as such term has been interpreted by the SEC and its staff and by courts in judicial proceedings under the Investment Company Act. Special situation investment companies generally are companies which secure control of other companies primarily for the purpose of making a profit in the sale of the controlled company s securities. The types of companies that have been characterized by the SEC in SEC releases, the SEC staff or by courts in judicial proceedings under the Investment Company Act as special situation investment companies are those that, as part of their history and their stated business purpose, engage in a pattern of acquiring large or controlling blocks of securities in companies, attempting to control or to exert a controlling influence over these companies, improving their performance and then disposing of acquired share positions after a short-term holding period at a profit once the acquired shares increase in value. Special situation investment companies also follow a policy of shifting from one investment to another because greater profits seem apparent elsewhere. We monitor our business activities, including our acquisitions and divestments, on an ongoing basis to avoid being deemed a special situation investment company. One of the factors that distinguishes us from a special situation investment company is our policy of acquiring middle-market U.S. businesses with the expectation of operating these businesses over a long-term basis that for us will involve a minimum holding period of four to six years. 
 A change in the value of our assets could cause us or one or more of our wholly- or majority-owned subsidiaries to fall within the definition of investment company and negatively affect our ability to maintain our exclusion from registration under the Investment Company Act. To avoid being required to register the company or any of its subsidiaries as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be unable to acquire businesses with an intention of disposing of them on a short-term basis. In addition, we may in other circumstances be unable to sell assets we would otherwise want to sell and may need to sell assets we would otherwise wish to retain. We also may have to acquire additional income- or loss-generating assets that we might not otherwise have acquired or may have to forgo opportunities to acquire interests in companies that we would otherwise want to acquire and would be important to our business strategy. 
 If we become obligated to register the company or any of its subsidiaries as an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act, the registered entity would have to comply with a variety of substantive requirements under the Investment Company Act imposing, among other things: 
 limitations on capital structure; 
 restrictions on specified investments; 
 prohibitions on transactions with affiliates; and 
 compliance with reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations that would significantly change our operations. 
 If we were required to register the company as an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act but failed to do so, we would be prohibited from engaging in our business, and criminal and civil actions could be brought against us. In addition, our contracts would be unenforceable unless a court required enforcement, and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of us and liquidate our business, all of which would have a material adverse effect on us and the returns generated for shareholders. 
 If, in the future, we cease to control and operate our businesses, we may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 
 Under the terms of our LLC Agreement, we have the latitude to acquire equity interests in businesses that we will not operate or control. If we make significant acquisitions of equity interests in businesses that we do not operate or control or cease to operate and control such businesses, we may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we were deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we would either have to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, obtain exemptive relief from the SEC or modify our equity interests and debt positions or organizational structure or our contract rights to fall outside the definition of an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Registering as an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act could, among other things, materially adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations, materially limit our ability to borrow funds or engage in other transactions involving leverage and require us to add directors who are independent of us, the Manager and the Sub-Manager and otherwise will subject us to additional regulation that will be costly and time-consuming.

 Risks Related to the Manager, the Sub-Manager and Their Respective Affiliates 
 Our success will be dependent on the performance of the Manager and the Sub-Manager and their respective affiliates, but investors should not rely on the past performance of the Manager, the Sub-Manager and their respective affiliates as an indication of future success. Prior to the Initial Public Offering, affiliates of CNL have only sponsored real estate and credit investment programs. 
 The Manager was formed in August 2016. The Sub-Manager was formed in September 2016 and has limited experience managing a business under guidelines designed to allow us to avoid registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, which may hinder our ability to take advantage of attractive acquisition opportunities and, as a result, implement and execute our business strategy. In addition, the Sub-Manager has limited experience complying with regulatory requirements applicable to public companies. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to find suitable acquisition opportunities and our ability to implement and execute our business strategy and to pay distributions will be dependent upon the performance of the Manager and the Sub-Manager in the identification and acquisition of such opportunities and the management of our businesses and other assets. Additionally, investors should not rely on the past performance of investments by other CNL- or LLCP-affiliated entities to predict our future results. Our business strategy and key employees differ from the business strategies and key employees of certain other CNL- or LLCP-affiliated programs in the past, present and future. Prior to the Initial Public Offering, affiliates of CNL have only sponsored real estate and credit investment programs. If either the Manager or the Sub-Manager fails to perform according to our expectations, we could be materially adversely affected. 
 The Manager, the Sub-Manager and their respective affiliates, including our officers and some of our directors will face conflicts of interest including conflicts that may result from compensation arrangements with us and our affiliates, which could result in actions that are not in the best interests of our shareholders. 
 The Manager, the Sub-Manager and their respective affiliates will receive substantial fees from us (directly or indirectly) in return for their services, and these fees could influence the advice provided to us. Among other matters, the compensation arrangements could affect their judgment with respect to public and private offerings of equity by us, which allow the Managing Dealer to earn additional dealer manager fees and the Manager and the Sub-Manager to earn increased management fees. The Administrator and the Sub-Administrator will also face conflicts of interests with respect to their performance of various administrative services that we require, including but not limited to conflicts that may arise from the Administrator s and the Sub-Administrator s decisions with respect to the allocation of their time and resources as they relate to their recommendations and oversight of the personnel, facilities and services provided to us, and the quality of professional and administrative services rendered by their respective affiliates to us. The Manager, the Sub-Manager and their respective affiliates, including certain of our officers and some of our directors will face conflicts of interest including conflicts that may result from compensation arrangements. The Manager compensates the members of its management committee with incentive-based compensation, asset-based compensation and/or bonuses and awards which will vary based on the Manager s performance. 
 The incentive fees that we may pay to the Manager (50 of which would be paid to the Sub-Manager) may create an incentive for the Manager and the Sub-Manager to make acquisitions on our behalf that are risky or more speculative than would be the case in the absence of such compensation arrangement. The way in which the incentive fee is determined may encourage the Manager and the Sub-Manager to use leverage to increase the return on our assets. In addition, the fact that our base management fee for a certain month is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of that month and the immediately preceding calendar month, which would include any borrowings for investment purposes, may encourage the Manager and the Sub-Manager to use leverage or to acquire additional assets. The use of leverage increases the volatility of assets by magnifying the potential for gain or loss on invested equity capital. In addition, we and our shareholders will bear the burden of any increase in our expenses as a result of our use of leverage, including interest expenses and any increase in the management fees payable to the Manager. Our businesses may pay fees to the Sub-Manager for services it provides to them and therefore our shareholders may be indirectly subject to such fees. These fees may be paid before we realize any income or gain. The Manager and the Sub-Manager may face conflicts of interest with respect to services performed for our businesses, on the one hand, and opportunities recommended to us, on the other hand. Furthermore, our board of directors is responsible for determining the net asset value of our assets (with the assistance from the Manager, the Sub-Manager and the independent valuation firm) and, because the base management fee is payable monthly and for a certain month is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of that month and the immediately preceding calendar month, a higher net asset value of our assets would result in a higher base management fee to the Manager and the Sub-Manager.

 We pay substantial fees and expenses to the Manager, the Sub-Manager, the Managing Dealer or their respective affiliates. These payments increase the risk that investors will not earn a profit on their investment. 
 The Manager and the Sub-Manager perform services for us in connection with the identification, selection and acquisition of our assets, and the monitoring and administration of our assets. We pay the Manager and the Sub-Manager certain fees for management services, including a base management fee that is not tied to the performance of our assets. We pay fees and commissions to the Managing Dealer in connection with the offer and sale of the shares. We may pay third parties directly or reimburse the costs or expenses of third parties paid by the Administrator and the Sub-Administrator for providing us with certain administrative services. Since the Administrator and the Sub-Administrator are affiliates of the Manager and the Sub-Manager, respectively, they may experience conflicts of interests when seeking expense reimbursement from us. Similarly, our businesses may pay fees to the Sub-Manager for services it provides to them and therefore our shareholders may be indirectly subject to such fees. These fees reduce the amount of cash available for acquisitions or distribution to our shareholders. These fees also increase the risk that the amount available for distribution to shareholders upon a liquidation of our assets would be less than the purchase price of the shares in the Follow-On Public Offering and that investors may not earn a profit on their investment. 
 The time and resources that individuals associated with the Manager and the Sub-Manager devote to us may be diverted. 
 We currently expect the Manager, the Sub-Manager and their respective officers and employees to devote such time as shall be necessary to conduct our business affairs in an appropriate manner. However, the Manager, the Sub-Manager and their respective officers and employees are not required to do so. Moreover, neither the Manager, the Sub-Manager nor their affiliates are prohibited from raising money for and managing another entity that competes with us or our businesses, except as agreed to by the Manager and the Sub-Manager. Accordingly, the respective management teams of the Manager and the Sub-Manager may have obligations to investors in entities they work at or manage in the future, the fulfillment of which might not be in the best interests of us or our shareholders or that may require them to devote time to services for other entities, which could interfere with the time available to provide services to us. In addition, we may compete with any such investment entity for the same investors and acquisition opportunities. 
 We do not have a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, officers, or affiliates from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. 
 We do not have a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, officers, or affiliates from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. However, our code of business conduct contains a conflicts of interest policy that prohibits our directors and executive officers, as well as personnel of the Manager and the Sub-Manager who provide services to us, from engaging in any transaction that involves an actual conflict of interest with us without the approval of a majority of our independent directors. In addition, the Management Agreement and the Sub-Management Agreement do not prevent the Manager, the Sub-Manager and their respective affiliates from engaging in additional business opportunities, some of which could compete with us, except as agreed to by the Manager and the Sub-Manager. 
 The Manager and the Sub-Manager will experience conflicts of interest in connection with the management of our business affairs, our businesses and their respective other accounts and clients. 
 The Manager and the Sub-Manager will experience conflicts of interest in connection with the management of our business affairs relating to the allocation of business opportunities by the Manager, the Sub-Manager and their respective affiliates to us and other clients; compensation to the Manager, the Sub-Manager and their respective affiliates; services that may be provided by the Manager, the Sub-Manager and their respective affiliates to our businesses; co-investment opportunities for us and the allocation of such opportunities to us and other clients of the Manager and the Sub-Manager; the formation of investment vehicles by the Manager or the Sub-Manager; differing recommendations given by the Manager and the Sub-Manager to us versus other clients; the Manager s and the Sub-Manager s use of information gained from our businesses for investments by other clients, subject to applicable law; and restrictions on the Manager s and the Sub-Manager s use of inside information with respect to potential acquisitions by us.

 In connection with the services that the Sub-Manager or its affiliates may provide to the businesses we acquire, the Sub-Manager may be paid transaction fees in connection with services customarily performed in connection with the management of such businesses (except that no such transaction fees were charged on our acquisition of the initial businesses). Any transaction fees received by the Sub-Manager up to 1.5 million to 3.5 million annually (dependent on our total assets at the time of receipt of such transaction fees) will not be shared with us. Any transaction fees charged to businesses in excess of 3.5 million will be paid to us. Additionally, these fees may be paid before we realize any income or gain. We may also reimburse the Sub-Manager for certain transactional expenses (e.g. research costs, due diligence costs, professional fees, legal fees and other related items) related to businesses that we acquire as well as transactional expenses related to deals that do not close, often referred to as broken deal costs. The Manager and the Sub-Manager may face conflicts of interest with respect to services performed for our businesses, on the one hand, and opportunities recommended to us, on the other hand. 
 The Sub-Manager may experience conflicts of interests in their management of other clients that may have a similar business strategy as us. 
 The Sub-Manager and its affiliates currently manage other clients and may in the future manage new clients that may have a similar business strategy as us. The Sub-Manager will determine which opportunities it presents to us or another client with a similar business objective. The Sub-Manager may determine it is more appropriate for one or more other clients managed by the Sub-Manager or any of its affiliates than it is for us and present such opportunity to the other client. These co-investment opportunities may give rise to conflicts of interest or perceived conflicts of interest among us and the other participating accounts, including the amount of such co-investment opportunity allocated to us. 
 The Sub-Manager and its affiliates may (i) give advice and take action with respect to any of its other clients that may differ from advice given or the timing or nature of action taken with respect to us, so long as it is consistent with the provisions of the Sub-Manager s allocation policy and its obligations under the Sub-Management Agreement, and (ii) subject to the Exclusivity Agreement and its obligations thereunder, engage in activities that overlap with or compete with those in which the company and its subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, may engage. The company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its subsidiaries, has renounced any interest or expectancy in, or right to be offered an opportunity to participate in, any business opportunity which may be a corporate opportunity for another client of the Sub-Manager or its affiliates to the extent such opportunity has been determined in good faith by the Sub-Manager not to be allocated to the company, all in accordance with the company s and the Sub-Manager s allocation policy. Furthermore, subject to the company s investment policy and its obligations under the Sub-Management Agreement, the Sub-Manager shall not have any obligation to recommend for purchase or sale any securities or loans which its principals, affiliates or employees may purchase or sell for its or their own accounts or for any other client or account if, in the opinion of the Sub-Manager, such transaction or investment appears unsuitable, impractical or undesirable for the Manager (on behalf of the company). 
 Consistent with our allocation policy, in the event that a co-investment opportunity that the Manager has approved for potential participation does not close and the Sub-Manager and its affiliates accumulate broken deal costs in connection with the co-investment opportunity, the Sub-Manager and its affiliates will be required to allocate such broken deal costs among us and the other participating accounts. Broken deal costs will generally be allocated to us by the Sub-Manager pro rata based on our allocation in a proposed co-investment opportunity if our allocation in such co-investment opportunity has been determined; however, in the event that we expect to participate in a co-investment opportunity with Levine Leichtman Capital Partners VI, L.P. LLCP VI ), or LLCP Lower Middle Market Fund III, L.P. LMM III Fund which accumulates broken deal costs and our allocation in such co-investment opportunity has not been determined, we will be allocated 5 of the broken deal costs with respect to a co-investment with LLCP VI, or 10 of the broken deal costs with respect to a co-investment with the LMM III Fund, subject to annual review by the Sub-Manager. We may similarly act as a dedicated co-investor for other private acquisition funds advised by affiliates of the Sub-Manager that are formed in the future, with our allocation percentage being determined at or prior to the time we begin pursuing co-investment opportunities with such vehicles and subject to annual review by the Sub-Manager. Additionally, on a quarterly basis, the Sub-Manager will identify third party broken deal costs for opportunities that were not presented to the Manager for prior approval but which are determined in the Sub-Manager s reasonable judgment and in a manner consistent with the Sub-Manager s fiduciary obligations to have qualified as a potential investment opportunity for us on a direct or co-investment basis (such opportunity, a lookback broken deal ). Subject to approval by the Manager, we will reimburse the Sub-Manager for our allocable portion of third party broken deal expenses incurred in connection with a lookback broken deal. In the case of a lookback broken deal identified as an opportunity on a co-investment basis with LLCP VI, or LMM III Fund, our allocable portion of such third party broken deal expenses will be 5 , or 10 , respectively. Unless our board of directors approves otherwise, in no event will our portion of the aggregate lookback broken deal expenses exceed 75,000 on a calendar year basis.

 The Manager and its respective affiliates may have an incentive to delay a liquidity event, which may result in actions that are not in the best interest of our shareholders. 
 We pay certain amounts to the Managing Dealer and participating broker-dealers in connection with the distribution of certain classes of shares for the ongoing marketing, sale and distribution of such shares, including an ongoing distribution and shareholder servicing fee. The ongoing distribution and shareholder servicing fee for these classes of shares will terminate for all shareholders upon a liquidity event. As such, the Manager may have an incentive to delay a liquidity event or making such recommendation to our board of directors if such amounts receivable by the Managing Dealer have not been fully paid. A delay in a liquidity event may not be in the best interests of our shareholders. 
 Our access to confidential information may restrict our ability to take action with respect to our businesses, which, in turn, may negatively affect our results of operations. 
 We, directly or through the Manager or the Sub-Manager, may obtain confidential information about our businesses. If we possess confidential information about such businesses, there may be restrictions on our ability to make, dispose of, increase the amount of, or otherwise take action with respect to, those businesses. The impact of these restrictions on our ability to take action with respect to such businesses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 We may be obligated to pay the Manager and the Sub-Manager incentive fees even if there is a decline in the value of our assets for that calendar year and even if our earned interest income is not payable in cash. 
 The Management Agreement and the Sub-Management Agreement entitle the Manager and the Sub-Manager to receive an incentive fee based on the total return of each class of our shares regardless of any capital losses. In such case, we may be required to pay the Manager and the Sub-Manager an incentive fee for a calendar year even if there is a decline in the value of our assets for that calendar year or if our net asset value is less than the purchase price of an investor s shares. 
 Any incentive fee payable by us that relates to the total return of each class of our shares may be computed and paid on income that may include interest that has been accrued but not yet received or interest in the form of securities received rather than cash payment-in-kind or PIK income) or based on unrealized gains. If one of our businesses defaults on a loan that is structured to provide accrued interest income, it is possible that accrued interest income previously included in the calculation of the incentive fee will become uncollectible. The Manager and the Sub-Manager are not obligated to reimburse us for any part of the incentive fee they received that was based on accrued interest income that we never received as a result of a subsequent default or an unrealized gain. Although we do not expect our debt assets to include a PIK feature, to the extent we do so, PIK income will be included in the total return of each class of our shares used to calculate the incentive fee to the Manager and the Sub-Manager even though we do not receive the income in the form of cash. 
 The Manager s and the Sub-Manager s liability is limited under the Management Agreement, the Sub-Management Agreement, the Administrative Services Agreement and the Sub-Administration Agreement, as applicable, and we are required to indemnify the Manager and the Sub-Manager against certain liabilities, which may lead them to act in a riskier manner on our behalf than it would when acting for their own account. 
 The Manager and the Sub-Manager have not assumed any responsibility to us other than to render the services described in the Management Agreement, the Sub-Management Agreement, the Administrative Services Agreement and the Sub-Administration Agreement, as applicable. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, the Sub-Management Agreement, the Administrative Services Agreement and the Sub-Administration Agreement, as applicable, the Manager, the Sub-Manager and their respective officers, managers, partners, members, agents, employees, controlling persons, shareholders, and any other person or entity affiliated with the Manager and the Sub-Manager will not be liable to us or any of our subsidiaries members, stockholders or partners in connection with the performance of any duties or obligations under the Management Agreement, the Sub-Management Agreement, the Administrative Services Agreement and the Sub-Administration Agreement, absent negligence or misconduct in the performance of the Manager s or the Sub-Manager s duties, as applicable. We have also agreed to indemnify, defend and protect the Manager, the Sub-Manager and their respective officers, managers, partners, members, agents, employees, controlling persons and any other person or entity affiliated with the Manager and the Sub-Manager with respect to all damages, liabilities, costs and expenses incurred in or by reason of any pending, threatened or completed, action suit investigation or other proceeding resulting from acts of the Manager and the Sub-Manager not arising out of negligence or misconduct in the performance of the Manager s or the Sub-Manager s duties, as applicable, under such agreements. These protections may lead the Manager and the Sub-Manager to act in a riskier manner when acting on our behalf than it would when acting for their own account.

 Each of the Manager and the Sub-Manager can resign on 120 days notice and, pursuant to the Sub-Management Agreement, the Manager and the Sub-Manager have agreed to resign if the other is terminated for anything other than cause and we may not be able to find suitable replacement(s) within that time, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 The Manager has the right, under the Management Agreement, to resign at any time on 120 days written notice, whether we have found a replacement or not. If the Manager resigns, we may not be able to contract with a new manager or hire internal management with similar expertise and ability to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms within 120 days, or at all, in which case our operations are likely to experience a disruption and our financial condition, business and results of operations as well as our ability to pay distributions are likely to be adversely affected. In addition, the coordination of our internal management, business activities and supervision of our businesses is likely to suffer if we are unable to identify and reach an agreement with a single institution or group of executives having the expertise possessed by the Manager and its affiliates. Even if we are able to retain comparable management, whether internal or external, the integration of such management and their lack of familiarity with our businesses may result in additional costs and time delays that may adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 The Sub-Manager also has the right, under the Sub-Management Agreement, to resign at any time on 120 days written notice, whether the Manager or the company has found a replacement or not. If the Sub-Manager resigns, the Manager and the company may not be able to contract with a new sub-manager. The Sub-Management Agreement provides that, in the event the Manager or the Sub-Manager is terminated or not renewed as a manager or sub-manager, other than for cause, the other will also terminate its Management Agreement or Sub-Management Agreement, as applicable. In such case, our operations are likely to experience a disruption and our financial condition, business and results of operations as well as our ability to pay distributions are likely to be adversely affected. 
 Risks Related to Our Business 
 A business strategy focused primarily on privately held companies presents certain challenges, including the lack of available information about these companies. 
 We intend to acquire controlling interests in privately held, middle-market U.S. businesses which by their nature pose certain incremental risks as compared to public companies including that they: 
 have reduced access to the capital markets, resulting in diminished capital resources and ability to withstand financial distress; 
 may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under their debt securities that we may hold, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of any collateral and a reduction in the likelihood of our realizing any guarantees we may have obtained in connection with our acquisition; 
 may have shorter operating histories, narrower product lines and smaller market shares than larger businesses, which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors actions and changing market conditions, as well as general economic downturns; 
 are more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons; therefore, the death, disability, resignation or termination of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on our privately held company and, in turn, on us; and 
 generally have less predictable operating results, may from time to time be parties to litigation, may be engaged in rapidly changing businesses with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence, and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive position. In addition, our executive officers, directors and members of the Manager s and the Sub-Manager s management may, in the ordinary course of business, be named as defendants in litigation arising from our ownership of these companies.

 In addition, interests in private companies tend to be less liquid. The securities of private companies are not publicly traded or actively traded on the secondary market and are, instead, traded on a privately negotiated over-the-counter secondary market for institutional investors. These over-the-counter secondary markets may be inactive during an economic downturn or a credit crisis. In addition, the securities in these companies will be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or will otherwise be less liquid than publicly traded securities. If there is no readily available market for these assets, we are required to carry these assets at fair value as determined by our board of directors. As a result, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our assets quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we had previously recorded these assets. We may also face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate our ownership of a business to the extent that we, the Manager, the Sub-Manager or any of their respective affiliates have material nonpublic information regarding such business or where the sale would be an impermissible joint transaction. The reduced liquidity of these assets may make it difficult for us to dispose of them at a favorable price, and, as a result, we may suffer losses. 
 Finally, little public information generally exists about private companies and these companies may not have third-party credit ratings or audited financial statements. We must therefore rely on the ability of the Manager and the Sub-Manager to obtain adequate information through due diligence to evaluate the creditworthiness and potential returns from these business opportunities. Additionally, these companies and their financial information will not generally be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other rules that govern public companies. If we are unable to uncover all material information about these companies, we may not make a fully informed business decision, and we may lose money on our assets. 
 We face risks with respect to the evaluation and management of future acquisitions. 
 A significant component of our business strategy is to acquire controlling equity interests in businesses. We intend to focus on middle-market U.S. businesses in various industries. Generally, because such businesses are held privately, we may experience difficulty in evaluating potential target businesses as the information concerning these businesses is not publicly available. Therefore, our estimates and assumptions used to evaluate the operations, management and market risks with respect to potential target businesses may be subject to various risks. Further, the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential target businesses and their industries may cause a substantial drain on our resources and may divert our management team s attention away from operations for significant periods of time. In addition, we may incur substantial broken deal costs in connection with acquisition opportunities that are not consummated. 
 In addition, we may have difficulty effectively managing the businesses we acquire. The management or improvement of businesses we acquire may be hindered by a number of factors including limitations in the standards, controls, procedures and policies of such acquisitions. Further, the management of an acquired business may involve a substantial reorganization resulting in the loss of employees and customers or the disruption of our ongoing businesses. Some of the businesses we acquire may have significant exposure to certain key customers, the loss of which could negatively impact our financial condition, business and results of operations. We may experience greater than expected costs or difficulties relating to such acquisition, in which case, we might not achieve the anticipated returns from any particular acquisition, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 In addition, certain members of the management teams of our businesses have, and may have in the future, the opportunity to participate in equity incentive programs which are expected to be based on the satisfaction of certain performance criteria and metrics and may include receipt of options. Although we believe such awards are important incentives for the management teams of our businesses, such awards could decrease our percentage ownership in a business to the extent such award vests and is exercised in the future. 
 If we cannot obtain debt financing or equity capital on acceptable terms, our ability to finance future acquisitions of businesses and expand our operations will be adversely affected. 
 The net proceeds from the sale of our shares in the Follow-On Public Offering will be used to finance the acquisition of businesses, and, if necessary, the payment of operating expenses and the payment of various fees and expenses such as management fees, incentive fees, other fees and distributions. Any working capital reserves we maintain may not be sufficient for business purposes, and we may require additional debt financing or equity capital to operate. These sources of funding may not be available to us due to unfavorable economic conditions, which could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. Consequently, if we cannot obtain further debt or equity financing on acceptable terms, our ability to fund the acquisition of businesses and to expand our operations will be adversely affected. As a result, we would be less able to execute our business strategy, which may negatively impact our results of operations and reduce our ability to make distributions to our shareholders.

 We may face increasing competition for acquisition opportunities, which could delay deployment of our capital, reduce returns and result in losses. 
 We compete for acquisitions with strategic buyers, private equity funds and diversified holding companies. Additionally, we may compete for loans with traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks. Certain competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have access to funding sources that are not available to us, and others may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments. These characteristics could allow our competitors to consider a wider variety of acquisition opportunities, establish more relationships and offer better pricing and more flexible structuring than we are able to do. We may lose acquisition opportunities if we do not match our competitors pricing, terms or structure. If we are forced to match our competitors pricing, terms and structure, we may not be able to achieve acceptable risk-adjusted returns on our businesses or may bear risk of loss, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we lose an acquisition opportunity, we may still incur broken deal costs related to the review of an opportunity that is not consummated, which could be substantial. 
 We rely on receipts from our businesses to make distributions to our shareholders. 
 We are dependent upon the ability of our businesses to generate earnings and cash flow and distribute them to us in the form of interest and principal payments of indebtedness and, from time to time, distributions on equity to enable us, first, to satisfy our financial obligations and, second to make distributions to our shareholders. This ability may be subject to limitations under laws of the jurisdictions in which they are incorporated or organized. As a consequence of these various restrictions, we may be unable to generate sufficient receipts from our businesses, and therefore, we may not be able to declare, or may have to delay or cancel payment of, distributions to our shareholders. 
 We do not intend to own 100 of our businesses. While we receive cash payments from our businesses which are in the form of interest payments, debt repayment and distributions, if any distributions were to be paid by our businesses, they would be shared pro rata with the minority shareholders of our businesses and the amounts of distributions made to minority shareholders would not be available to us for any purpose, including debt service or distributions to our shareholders. Any proceeds from the sale of a business will be allocated among us and the non-controlling shareholders of the business that is sold. 
 We anticipate acquiring controlling interests in a limited number of businesses and these businesses may be subject to unplanned business interruptions. 
 We anticipate acquiring controlling interests in a limited number of companies. As a result, the performance of our business may be substantially adversely affected by the unfavorable performance of even a single business. Further, operational interruptions and unplanned events at one or more production facilities of these businesses, such as explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, pandemics, accidents, transportation interruptions and supply could cause substantial losses in our production capacity. Furthermore, because customers may be dependent on planned deliveries from us, customers that have to reschedule their own operations due to our delivery delays may be able to pursue financial claims against us, and we may incur costs to correct such problems in addition to any liability resulting from such claims. Such interruptions may also harm our reputation among actual and potential customers, potentially resulting in a loss of business. To the extent these losses are not covered by insurance, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by such events.

 The outbreak of highly infectious or contagious diseases, including the ongoing pandemic of the novel coronavirus ("COVID-19") or its variants and other future pandemics, could materially and adversely impact our business, our operating businesses, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases, including the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 or its variants and other future pandemics, could materially and adversely affect our business, our operating businesses, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Manager and the Sub-Manager have not been prevented and do not expect to be prevented from conducting business activities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, our portfolio companies could be prevented from conducting business activities in the future as a result of, among other things, any quarantines, work and travel restrictions, supply chain disruptions and labor shortages in response to the new variants of COVID-19 or other future pandemics. Since certain aspects of the services provided by our businesses involve face to face interaction, any quarantines and work and travel restrictions in response to COVID-19 or other future pandemics may reduce participation or result in a loss of business. Additionally, since certain of the products offered by our businesses are manufactured in a facility or distributed through retail stores, a closure of such facility, loss in business for such retail store, or our businesses inability to obtain raw materials and to ship products in a timely and cost-effective manner due to COVID-19 or other future pandemics could have an adverse impact on production schedules and product sales. As of December 31, 2022, all of the facilities were open and safety procedures have been implemented across our portfolio companies; however, there is a continued risk of temporary business interruptions resulting from employees contracting COVID-19 or from the reinstitution of business closures or work and travel restrictions in response to COVID-19 or other future pandemics or outbreaks. Further, if the U.S. and global economy slow down or consumer behavior shifts due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other future pandemics (including the continued threat or perceived threat of such pandemic), the demand for the products or services offered by our operating businesses may be reduced. Nevertheless, COVID-19 or other future pandemics could present material uncertainty and risk with respect to our business, our operating businesses, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 In certain circumstances, certain business analyses and decisions by the Manager and the Sub-Manager may be required to be undertaken on an expedited basis. 
 While we generally will not seek to make an acquisition until the Sub-Manager has conducted sufficient due diligence to make a determination whether to pursue an acquisition opportunity, in such cases, the information available to the Manager and the Sub-Manager at the time of making an acquisition decision may be limited. In certain circumstances, the business analyses and decisions by the Manager and the Sub-Manager may be required to be undertaken on an expedited basis to take advantage of acquisition opportunities. Therefore, no assurance can be given that the Manager and the Sub-Manager will have knowledge of all circumstances that may adversely affect such decision. In addition, the Manager and the Sub-Manager expect often to rely upon independent consultants in connection with its evaluation of proposed acquisitions. No assurance can be given as to the accuracy or completeness of the information provided by such independent consultants and we may incur liability as a result of such consultants actions. 
 Our success is dependent on general economic, political and market conditions. 
 Our portfolio companies and the success of our investment activities in particular are affected by global and national economic, political and market conditions generally and also by the local economic conditions where our portfolio companies are located and operate. These factors may affect the businesses our portfolio companies operate, which could impair the profitability or result in losses. In addition, general fluctuations in the market prices of securities and interest rates may affect our investment opportunities and the value of our investments. 
 Based on expected moderate, but improved, future economic growth, and historically low levels of interest rates, the valuations and pricing of durable/high-quality private companies continued to increase in the last couple years. Nevertheless, the ongoing competition for high quality private companies may reduce anticipated returns in the future. Furthermore, economic growth remains affected by inflationary pressure, rising interest rates, recessionary concerns and supply chain related disruptions and could be slowed or halted by significant external events. For example, in response to recent inflationary pressure, the U.S. Federal Reserve and other global central banks have raised interest rates in 2022 and have indicated likely further interest rate increases. A negative shock to the economy could result in reduced valuations and multiples for the acquisitions. There can be no assurance that our investments will not be adversely affected by a severe slowing of the economy or renewed recession. Fluctuations in interest rates, inflationary pressure, supply chain issues, changes in labor and material costs, and limited availability of capital and other economic conditions beyond our control could negatively affect our portfolio and decrease the value of our investments. 
 Any of the following events could result in substantial impact to our portfolio companies and to the value of our investments in these portfolio companies: 
 changes in global, national, regional or local economic, demographic or capital market conditions; 
 25 

T a b l e o f Contents 

 a recession, slowdown or sustained downturn in the U.S. market, and to a lesser extent, the global economy (or any particular segment thereof); 
 overall weakening of, or disruptions in, the financial markets; 
 perceived or actual economic distress or failures of financial institutions; 
 future adverse acquisitions trends, including increasing multiplies and pricing of private companies, declining yield on investments; 
 future adverse valuation trends, including the compression of the multiples used for valuations; 
 changes in supply of or demand for products/services offered by our portfolio companies; 
 increased competition for businesses/portfolio companies targeted by our investment strategy; 
 increases in interest rates and inflationary pressures on labor rates and input costs, which may impact the margins of our portfolio companies; 
 any supply chain related disruptions exacerbated by the ongoing COVID-19 or other future pandemics and changes in labor and material costs which may have a pronounced impact on the profitability of our portfolio companies; 
 geopolitical challenges and uncertainties (including wars and other forms of conflict, terrorist acts and security operations), such as the escalating conflict between Russia, Belarus and Ukraine and the severe economic sanctions and export controls imposed by the U.S. and other governments against Russia, Belarus and Russian and Belarusian interests; and 
 changes in government rules, regulations and fiscal policies, including increases in taxes, changes in zoning laws and increasing costs to comply with environmental laws. 
 All of these factors are beyond our control. Any negative changes in these factors could affect our performance and our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to stockholders. 
 We will be exposed to risks associated with changes to overall pricing and valuation multiples of durable and high-quality private companies. 
 Based on expected moderate, but improved, future economic growth, and historically low levels of interest rates, the valuations and pricing of durable and high-quality private companies continued to increase in the last couple years. Furthermore, the ongoing competition for high quality private companies and resulting upward pressure on pricing may increase the acquisition cost of our assets and, as a result, could reduce anticipated returns in the future. Furthermore, economic growth remains affected by inflationary pressure and supply chain related disruptions and could be slowed or halted by significant external events. A negative shock to the economy could result in reduced valuations and multiples for our existing businesses. There can be no assurance that our businesses will not be adversely affected by a severe slowing of the economy or renewed recession. Fluctuations in interest rates, inflationary pressure, supply chain issues and limited availability of capital and other economic conditions beyond our control could negatively affect our portfolio and decrease the value of our assets. 
 Financial results of certain of our businesses may be affected by the operating results of and actions taken by their franchisees. 
 Certain of our businesses may receive a substantial portion of their revenues in the form of royalties, which are generally based on a percentage of gross sales from franchisees. Accordingly, financial results of such businesses are to a large extent dependent upon the operational and financial success of their franchisees. If sales trends or economic conditions deteriorate for franchisees, their financial results may also deteriorate and the royalties paid to such businesses may decline and the accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts may increase. In addition, if the franchisees fail to renew their franchise agreements, royalty revenues of these businesses may decrease which in turn may materially and adversely affect business and operating results of these businesses. For example, Lawn Doctor, Inc. Lawn Doctor one of our initial businesses, relies primarily on broker referrals for new franchise development and has two main broker relationships that are key to driving new franchisee growth, in addition to its corporate employees generating opportunities. Any disputes with brokers could negatively affect Lawn Doctor s ability to attract new franchisees and adversely affect its business and operating results.

T a b l e o f Contents 

 Additionally, although franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their businesses in accordance with the operations, safety, and health standards set forth in agreements between our businesses and their franchisees, such franchisees are independent third parties whom we or our businesses do not control. The franchisees own, operate, and oversee the daily operations of their business and have sole control over all employee and other workforce decisions. As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchisee s business rests with the franchisee. If franchisees do not successfully operate their business in a manner consistent with required standards, royalty income paid to our businesses may be adversely affected and brand image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could materially and adversely affect business and operating results of our businesses. 
 For certain of our businesses, a limited number of customers may account for a large portion of their net sales, so that if one or more of the major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to such businesses, cease doing business with such businesses, significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from such businesses or return substantial amounts of such businesses products, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 For certain of our businesses, a limited number of customers may account for a large portion of their gross sales, so that if one or more of the major customers of such businesses were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to such businesses, cease doing business with such businesses, significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from such businesses or return substantial amounts of such businesses products, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Except for outstanding purchase orders for specific products, certain of our businesses may not have written contracts with or commitments from any of their customers and pursuant to the terms of certain of their vendor agreements, even some purchase orders may be cancelled without penalty until delivery. A substantial reduction in or termination of orders from any of their largest customers could adversely affect their business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, pressure by large customers seeking price reductions, financial incentives, and changes in other terms of sale or for these businesses to bear the risks and the cost of carrying inventory could also adversely affect business, financial condition and results of operations of our businesses. In addition, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of the significant customers could negatively impact such businesses revenues and bad debt expense. 
 Some of our businesses are or may be dependent upon the financial and operating conditions of their customers and clients. If the demand for their customers and clients products and services declines, demand for their products and services will be similarly affected and could have a material adverse effect on their financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 The success of our businesses customers and clients products and services in the market and the strength of the markets in which these customers and clients operate affect our businesses. Our businesses customers and clients are subject to their own business cycles, thus posing risks to these businesses that are beyond our control. These cycles are unpredictable in commencement, severity and duration. Due to the uncertainty in the markets served by most of our businesses customers and clients, our businesses cannot accurately predict the continued demand for their customers and clients products and services and the demands of their customers and clients for their products and services. As a result of this uncertainty, past operating results, earnings and cash flows may not be indicative of our future operating results, earnings and cash flows. If the demand for their customers and clients products and services declines, demand for their products and services will be similarly affected and could have a material adverse effect on their financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 Certain of our businesses compete in highly competitive markets which are subject to the risk of market disruption including from the development and advancement of new technologies and there can be no assurance that our businesses will be able to compete successfully. For example, Healthcare Safety Holdings HSH business competes in the highly competitive medical supply market. HSH s daily use insulin pen needles, syringes and complementary offerings for the diabetes care markets compete with other needle-syringes manufacturers and other alternative drug delivery systems. The lack of product differentiation among manufacturers of traditional needles and syringes may subject HSH to downward product pricing pressures in the market. Other companies may develop new products that compete directly or indirectly with HSH s products. A variety of new technologies, including other delivery methods such as microneedles on dissolvable patches and transdermal patches are being marketed as alternatives to injection for drug delivery. HSH s narrow focus as a manufacturer of traditional needles and syringes products increases the risk that HSH loses market share to competing products and alternative drug delivery systems. While we currently do not believe such technologies have significantly affected the use of injection for drug delivery to date, there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future or have an adverse impact on the value of HSH.

 Some of our businesses are and may be subject to a variety of federal, state and foreign laws and regulations concerning employment, health, safety and products liability. Failure to comply with governmental laws and regulations could subject them to, among other things, potential financial liability, penalties and legal expenses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 Some of our businesses are and may be subject to various federal, state and foreign government employment, health, safety and products liability regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations, which may be more stringent in some jurisdictions, is a major consideration for our businesses. Government regulators generally have considerable discretion to change or increase regulation of our operations, or implement additional laws or regulations that could materially adversely affect our businesses. For example, as a manufacturer and seller of pen needle and syringes, one of our portfolio companies, HSH, is subject to significant regulatory oversight from governmental authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration as well as inherent products liability risk in the event of a product failure or a personal injury caused by HSH s products. Noncompliance with applicable regulations and requirements could subject our businesses to investigations, sanctions, product recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties or injunctions. Suffering any of these consequences could materially adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations. In addition, responding to any action may result in a diversion of the Manager s, the Sub-Manager s and our executive officers attention and resources from our operations. 
 Some of our businesses are and may be subject to federal, state and foreign environmental laws and regulations that expose them to potential financial liability. Complying with applicable environmental laws requires significant resources, and if our businesses fail to comply, they could be subject to substantial liability. 
 Some of the facilities and operations of our businesses are and may be subject to a variety of federal, state and foreign environmental laws and regulations including laws and regulations pertaining to the handling, storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes, which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws and regulations currently in place and in the future. Compliance with current and future environmental laws is a major consideration for certain of our businesses as any material violations of these laws can lead to substantial liability, revocations of discharge permits, fines or penalties. Because some of our businesses may use hazardous materials in their operations, they may be subject to potential financial liability for costs associated with the investigation and remediation of their own sites if such sites become contaminated. Even if they fully comply with applicable environmental laws and are not directly at fault for the contamination, such businesses may still be liable. 
 The identification of presently unidentified environmental conditions, more vigorous enforcement by regulatory agencies, enactment of more stringent laws and regulations, or other unanticipated events may arise in the future and give rise to material environmental liabilities, higher than anticipated levels of operating expenses and capital investment or, depending on the severity of the impact of the foregoing factors, costly plant relocation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 Some of our businesses are subject to certain risks associated with business they conduct in foreign jurisdictions. 
 Some of our businesses conduct business in foreign jurisdictions. Certain risks are inherent in conducting business in foreign jurisdictions, including: 
 exposure to local economic conditions; 
 difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems; 
 longer payment cycles for foreign customers; 
 adverse currency exchange controls; 
 exposure to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates; 
 potential adverse changes in the political environment of the foreign jurisdictions or diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States; 
 withholding taxes and restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investments and earnings; 
 export and import restrictions; 
 labor relations in the foreign jurisdictions; 
 difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights; and 
 required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations.

 Some of the businesses we acquire may rely on their intellectual property and licenses to use others intellectual property, for competitive advantage. If they are unable to protect their intellectual property, are unable to obtain or retain licenses to use others intellectual property, or if they infringe upon or are alleged to have infringed upon others intellectual property, it could have a material adverse effect on their financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 Each business success depends in part on their, or licenses to use others brand names, proprietary technology and manufacturing techniques. Such businesses may rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect their intellectual property rights. The steps they have taken to protect their intellectual property rights may not prevent third parties from using their intellectual property and other proprietary information without their authorization or independently developing intellectual property and other proprietary information that is similar. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect the intellectual property rights of these companies effectively or to the same extent as the laws of the United States. 
 Stopping unauthorized use of their proprietary information and intellectual property, and defending against claims that they have made unauthorized use of others proprietary information or intellectual property, may be difficult, time-consuming and costly. The use of their intellectual property and other proprietary information by others, and the use by others of their intellectual property and proprietary information, could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage they have developed, cause them to lose sales or otherwise harm their business. 
 Some of the businesses we acquire may become involved in legal proceedings and claims in the future either to protect their intellectual property or to defend allegations that they have infringed upon others intellectual property rights. These claims and any resulting litigation could subject them to significant liability for damages and invalidate their property rights. In addition, these lawsuits, regardless of their merits, could be time consuming and expensive to resolve and could divert management s time and attention. The costs associated with any of these actions could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on their financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 Some of the businesses we acquire may be subject to certain risks associated with the movement of businesses offshore. 
 Some of the businesses we acquire may be potentially at risk of losing business to competitors operating in lower cost countries. An additional risk is the movement offshore of some customers of these businesses we control, leading them to procure products or services from more closely located companies. Either of these factors could negatively impact our financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 Defaults by our businesses will harm our operating results. 
 A business s failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by us or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, termination of its debt financing and foreclosure on its secured assets, which could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements and jeopardize such business s ability to meet its obligations under the debt or equity securities that we hold. We may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms, which may include the waiver of certain financial covenants, with a defaulting business. Further, there may not be any prepayment penalty for our borrowers who prepay their loans. If borrowers choose to prepay their loans, we may not receive the full amount of interest payments otherwise to be received by us. 
 Our businesses may incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our debt in such businesses. 
 Our businesses may have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our debt in such businesses. By their terms, such debt may entitle the holders to receive payment of interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments with respect to our debt in such business. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of our business, holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our debt in that business would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution. After repaying such senior creditors, such business may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us. In the case of debt ranking equally with our debt in the business, we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other creditors holding such debt in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant business.

 We may not have the funds or ability to make additional capital contributions or loans to our businesses. 
 After our initial acquisition of an equity stake in a business or loans to such business, we may be called upon from time to time to provide additional funds to such business or have the opportunity to increase our capital contributions. There is no assurance that we will make, or will have sufficient funds to make, follow-on contributions. Even if we do have sufficient capital to make a desired follow-on contribution, we may elect not to make a follow-on contribution because we may not want to increase our level of risk or we prefer other opportunities. Our ability to make follow-on contributions may also be limited by the Manager s and the Sub-Manager s allocation policies. Any decisions not to make a follow-on contribution or any inability on our part to make such a contribution may have a negative impact on such business, may result in a missed opportunity for us to increase our participation in a successful operation or may reduce our expected return with respect to the business. 
 The debt positions we will typically acquire in connection with our acquisition of controlling equity interests in businesses may be risky, and we could lose all or part of our assets. 
 When we acquire a controlling equity interest in a business, we also will typically acquire a debt position in such business, which may be in the form of senior or subordinated securities. 
 When we acquire senior debt, we will generally seek to take a security interest in the available assets of a business, including equity interests in any of its subsidiaries. There is a risk that the collateral securing our loans may decrease in value over time or lose its entire value, may be difficult to sell in a timely manner, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based upon the success of the business and market conditions, including as a result of the inability of the business to raise additional capital. Also, in some circumstances, our lien could be subordinated to claims of other creditors. In addition, deterioration in such business s financial condition and prospects, including its inability to raise additional capital, may be accompanied by deterioration in the value of the collateral for the loan. Consequently, the fact that a loan is secured does not guarantee that we will receive principal and interest payments according to the loan s terms, or at all, or that we will be able to collect on the loan should we be forced to enforce our remedies. 
 Our acquisitions of subordinated debt will generally be subordinated to senior debt and will generally be unsecured, which may result in a heightened level of risk and volatility or a loss of principal, which could lead to the loss of the entire investment. These acquisitions may involve additional risks that could adversely affect our returns as compared to our acquisition of senior debt. To the extent interest payments associated with such debt are deferred, such debt may be subject to greater fluctuations in valuations, and such debt could subject us and our shareholders to non-cash income. We will not receive any principal repayments prior to the maturity of most of our subordinated debt, which may be of greater risk than amortizing loans. 
 We may acquire debt and minority interests in businesses and, if we do so, we may not be in a position to control such businesses, and their respective management team may make decisions that could decrease the value of our assets. 
 We anticipate that most of our net assets will be used for acquisitions which will involve controlling equity interests in businesses, but we may acquire only debt and/or minority interests in certain businesses. If we do so, we will be subject to risk that such businesses may make business decisions with which we disagree, and the management of such businesses may take risks or otherwise act in ways that do not serve our best interests. As a result, such businesses may make decisions that could decrease the value of our assets. In addition, we will generally not be in a position to control any business by acquiring its debt securities. 
 We may also participate in co-investment opportunities with affiliates of the Sub-Manager or with other third parties through partnerships, joint ventures or other entities, thereby acquiring jointly-controlled or non-controlling interests in businesses in conjunction with participation by one or more parties in such opportunity. As participants in such co-investment opportunities, we may have economic or other business interests or objectives that are inconsistent with those of our third-party partners or co-venturers. We may not have a right to participate in the operation, management, direction or control of such businesses, and our ability to redeem or sell all or a portion of our investment may be subject to significant restrictions. Furthermore, such co-investment opportunities may involve risks not present in acquisitions where a third party is not involved, including the possibility that we may incur liabilities as the result of actions taken by the controlling party and that a third-party partner or co-venturer may have financial difficulties and may have different liquidity objectives.

 The credit ratings of certain of our assets may not be indicative of the actual credit risk of such rated instruments. 
 Rating agencies rate certain debt securities based upon their assessment of the likelihood of the receipt of principal and interest payments. Rating agencies do not consider the risks of fluctuations in market value or other factors that may influence the value of debt securities. Therefore, the credit rating assigned to a particular instrument may not fully reflect the true risks of an investment in such instrument. Credit rating agencies may change their methods of evaluating credit risk and determining ratings. These changes may occur quickly and often. While we may give some consideration to ratings, ratings may not be indicative of the actual credit risk of our assets that are in rated instruments. In fact, most debt securities that we intend to acquire will not be rated by any rating agency and, if they were rated, they would most likely be rated as below investment grade quality. Debt securities rated below investment grade quality are generally regarded as having predominantly speculative characteristics and may carry a greater risk with respect to a borrower s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. 
 Subordinated liens on collateral securing debt that we may acquire in businesses may be subject to control by senior creditors with first priority liens. If there is a default, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to repay in full both the first priority creditors and us. 
 Certain debt that we will acquire in businesses may be secured on a second priority basis by the same collateral securing senior debt of such businesses. The first priority liens on the collateral will secure the business s obligations under any outstanding senior debt and may secure certain other future debt that may be permitted to be incurred by such business under the agreements governing the debt. In the event of a default, the holders of obligations secured by the first priority liens on the collateral will generally control the liquidation of and be entitled to receive proceeds from any realization of the collateral to repay their obligations in full before us. In addition, the value of the collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. There can be no assurance that the proceeds, if any, from the sale or sales of all of the collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the debt obligations secured by the second priority liens after payment in full of all obligations secured by the first priority liens on the collateral. If such proceeds are not sufficient to repay amounts outstanding under the debt obligations secured by the second priority liens, then we, to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the collateral, will only have an unsecured claim against the business s remaining assets, if any. 
 We may also acquire unsecured debt in businesses, meaning that such acquisitions will not benefit from any interest in collateral of such businesses. Liens on any such business s collateral, if any, will secure such business s obligations under its outstanding secured debt and may secure certain future debt that is permitted to be incurred by such business under its secured debt agreements. The holders of obligations secured by such liens will generally control the liquidation of, and be entitled to receive proceeds from, any realization of such collateral to repay their obligations in full before us. In addition, the value of such collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. There can be no assurance that the proceeds, if any, from sales of such collateral would be sufficient to satisfy our unsecured debt obligations after payment in full of all secured debt obligations. If such proceeds were not sufficient to repay the outstanding secured debt obligations, then our unsecured claims would rank equally with the unpaid portion of such secured creditors claims against the business s remaining assets, if any. 
 The rights we may have with respect to the collateral securing the debt we acquire in businesses with senior debt outstanding may also be limited pursuant to the terms of one or more intercreditor agreements that we enter into with the holders of senior debt. Under such an intercreditor agreement, at any time obligations that have the benefit of the first priority liens are outstanding, any of the following actions that may be taken in respect of the collateral will be at the direction of the holders of the obligations secured by the first priority liens: the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against the collateral; the ability to control the conduct of such proceedings; the approval of amendments to collateral documents; releases of liens on the collateral; and waivers of past defaults under collateral documents. We may not have the ability to control or direct such actions, even if our rights are adversely affected. 
 There may be circumstances where the loans we make to businesses could be subordinated to claims of other creditors or we could be subject to lender liability claims. 
 Although we intend to generally structure certain of our acquisitions as secured debt, if one of our businesses were to go bankrupt, depending on the facts and circumstances, including the extent to which we provided managerial assistance to such company or a representative of us or the Manager and the Sub-Manager sat on the board of directors of such company, a bankruptcy court might re-characterize our debt in a business and subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of other creditors. In situations where a bankruptcy carries a high degree of political significance, our legal rights may be subordinated to other creditors.

 In addition a number of U.S. judicial decisions have upheld judgments obtained by borrowers against lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed lender liability. Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has violated a duty (whether implied or contractual) of good faith, commercial reasonableness and fair dealing, or a similar duty owed to the borrower or has assumed an excessive degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or members. Because of the nature of our assets in businesses, we may be subject to allegations of lender liability. 
 Certain of our assets may be adversely affected by laws relating to fraudulent conveyance or voidable preferences. 
 Certain of our assets could be subject to federal bankruptcy law and state fraudulent transfer laws, which vary from state to state, if the debt obligations relating to such assets were issued with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or, in certain circumstances, if the issuer receives less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for issuing such debt obligations. If the debt is used for a buyout of shareholders, this risk is greater than if the debt proceeds are used for day-to-day operations or organic growth. If a court were to find that the issuance of the debt obligations was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could void or otherwise refuse to recognize the payment obligations under the debt obligations or the collateral supporting such obligations, further subordinate the debt obligations or the liens supporting such obligations to other existing and future indebtedness of the issuer or require us to repay any amounts received by us with respect to the debt obligations or collateral. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, we may not receive any repayment on the debt obligations. 
 Under certain circumstances, payments to us and distributions by us to our shareholders may be reclaimed if any such payment or distribution is later determined to have been a fraudulent conveyance, preferential payment or similar transaction under applicable bankruptcy and insolvency laws. Furthermore, assets involving restructurings may be adversely affected by statutes relating to, among other things, fraudulent conveyances, voidable preferences, lender liability and the court s discretionary power to disallow, subordinate or disenfranchise particular claims or re-characterize investments made in the form of debt as equity contributions. 
 We may acquire various structured financial instruments for purposes of hedging or reducing our risks, which may be costly and ineffective and could reduce the cash available to service our debt or for distribution to our shareholders. 
 We may seek to hedge against interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations and credit risk by using structured financial instruments such as futures, options, swaps and forward contracts. Use of structured financial instruments for hedging purposes may present significant risks, including the risk of loss of the amounts invested. Defaults by the other party to a hedging transaction can result in losses in the hedging transaction. Hedging activities also involve the risk of an imperfect correlation between the hedging instrument and the asset being hedged, which could result in losses both on the hedging transaction and on the instrument being hedged. Use of hedging activities may not prevent significant losses and could increase our losses. Further, hedging transactions may reduce cash available to service our debt or pay distributions to our shareholders. 
 The downgrade of the U.S. credit rating could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns continue to present the possibility of a credit-rating downgrade, economic slowdowns, or a recession for the United States. The impact of any downgrades to the U.S. government s sovereign credit rating could adversely affect the U.S. and global financial markets and economic conditions. These developments could cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise, which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms. Continued adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, if key economic indicators, such as the unemployment rate or inflation, progress at a rate consistent with the Federal Reserve s objectives, the target range for the federal funds rate may increase and cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise, which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms.

 To the extent that we borrow money, the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested in us will be magnified and may increase the risk of investing in us. Borrowed money may also adversely affect the return on our assets, reduce cash available to service our debt or for distribution to our shareholders, and result in losses. 
 The use of borrowings, also known as leverage, increases the volatility of investments by magnifying the potential for gain or loss on invested equity capital. If we use leverage to partially finance our acquisitions, through borrowing from banks and other lenders an investor will experience increased risks of investing in our securities. If the value of our assets decreases, leveraging would cause net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would if we had not borrowed and employed leverage. Similarly, any decrease in our income would cause net income to decline more sharply than it would have if we had not borrowed and employed leverage. Such a decline could negatively affect our ability to service our debt or make distributions to our shareholders. In addition, our shareholders will bear the burden of any increase in our expenses as a result of our use of leverage, including interest expenses and any increase in the management or incentive fees payable to the Manager and the Sub-Manager. Additionally, to the extent we use borrowings to finance a portion of the acquisition price of assets, we would make such acquisitions through corporate subsidiaries taxed at U.S. federal corporate tax rates, which may increase tax expenses. 
 The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on the Manager s and our board of directors assessment of market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. There can be no assurance that leveraged financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all. However, to the extent that we use leverage to finance our assets, our financing costs will be borne solely by our shareholders and will reduce cash available for distributions to our shareholders. Moreover, we may not be able to meet our financing obligations and, to the extent that we cannot, we risk the loss of some or all of our assets to liquidation or sale to satisfy the obligations. In such an event, we may be forced to sell assets at significantly depressed prices due to market conditions or otherwise, which may result in losses. 
 The replacement of LIBOR with Secured Overnight Financing SOFR or another alternative reference rate may adversely affect interest expense related to our borrowings. 
 In advance of the cessation of LIBOR on June 30, 2023, we entered into a new loan agreement (the 2022 Loan Agreement and related promissory note with First Horizon Bank for a 50.0 million revolving line of credit (the 2022 Line of Credit based on SOFR. SOFR is an index calculated by reference to short-term repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities that was selected as a preferred replacement for U.S. dollar LIBOR by the U.S. Federal Reserve. SOFR is calculated based on overnight transactions under repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. SOFR is observed and backward looking, which stands in contrast with U.S. dollar LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. 
 The transition to SOFR may present challenges, including, but not limited to, the illiquidity of SOFR derivatives markets, which could make it difficult for financial institutions to offer SOFR-based debt products, the determination of the spread adjustment required to convert LIBOR to SOFR (and the related determination of a term structure with different maturities), and that such transition may require substantial negotiations with counterparties. There is no guarantee that a transition from U.S dollar LIBOR to SOFR or any other alternative will not result in financial market disruptions, significant increases in benchmark rates, or borrowing costs to borrowers, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Whether or not SOFR attains market acceptance as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question. As such, the future of SOFR at this time remains uncertain. 
 Future litigation or administrative proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may become involved in legal proceedings, administrative proceedings, claims and other litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business. In defending ourselves in these proceedings, we may incur significant expenses in legal fees and other related expenses, regardless of the outcome of such proceedings. Unfavorable outcomes or developments relating to these proceedings, such as judgments for monetary damages, injunctions or denial or revocation of permits, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, settlement of claims could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

 We could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity attacks. 
 We, and our businesses, as well as the Manager and the Sub-Manager, may use a variety of information technology systems in the ordinary course of business, which are potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses and cyber attacks, including cyber attacks to our information technology infrastructure and attempts by others to gain access to our propriety or sensitive information, and ranging from individual attempts to advanced persistent threats. The risk of such a security breach or disruption has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased and will likely continue to increase in the future. The procedures and controls we use to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure may not be sufficient to prevent cyber security incidents. The results of these incidents could include disrupted operations, misstated or unreliable financial data, theft of trade secrets or other intellectual property, liability for disclosure of confidential customer, supplier or employee information, increased costs arising from the implementation of additional security protective measures, regulatory enforcement litigation and reputational damage, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations. These risks require continuous and likely increasing attention and other resources from us to, among other actions, identify and quantify these risks, upgrade and expand our technologies, systems and processes to adequately address them and provide periodic training for the Manager s employees to assist them in detecting phishing, malware and other schemes. Such attention diverts time and other resources from other activities and there is no assurance that our efforts will be effective. Additionally, the cost of maintaining and improving such systems and processes, procedures and internal controls may increase from its current level. Potential sources for disruption, damage or failure of our information technology systems include, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, human error, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Additionally, due to the size and nature of our company, we rely on third-party service providers for many aspects of our business. We can provide no assurance that the networks and systems that our third-party vendors have established or use will be effective. Even if we, our businesses, the Manager or the Sub-Manager are not targeted directly, cyberattacks on the U.S. and foreign governments, financial markets, financial institutions, or other businesses, including vendors, software creators, cybersecurity service providers, and other third parties with whom we, our businesses, the Manager or the Sub-Manager do business, may occur, and such events could disrupt our normal business operations and networks in the future. 
 We, and our businesses, are subject to a variety of federal, state and international laws and other obligations regarding data protection. 
 We, and our businesses, are subject to a variety of federal, state and international laws and other obligations regarding data protection. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing domestic and international requirements may cause us or our businesses to incur substantial costs or require us or one of our businesses to change its business practices. Any failure by us or one of our businesses to comply with its own privacy policy, applicable association rules, or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us or one of our businesses by governmental entities or others. Additionally, given the data collection and distribution focus of our Auriemma U.S. Roundtables Roundtables business, any failure could have a material impact on the use of its services by its customers. 
 We may acquire interests in joint ventures, which creates additional risk because, among other things, we cannot exercise sole decision making power and our partners may have different economic interests than we have. 
 We may acquire interests in joint ventures with third parties. There are additional risks involved in joint venture transactions. As a co-investor in a joint venture, we may not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority relating to the joint venture or other entity. As a result, the operations of the joint venture may be subject to the risk that third parties may make business, financial or management decisions with which we do not agree or the management of the joint venture may take risks or otherwise act in a manner that does not serve our interests. Further, there may be a potential risk of impasse in some business decisions because we may not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority. In such situations, it is possible that we may not be able to exit the relationship because we may not have the funds necessary to complete a buy-out of the other partner or it may be difficult to locate a third-party purchaser for our interest. Because we may not have the ability to exercise control over such operations, we may not be able to realize some or all of the benefits that we believe will be created from our involvement. In addition, there is the potential of our joint venture partner becoming bankrupt and the possibility of diverging or inconsistent economic or business interests of us and our partner. These diverging interests could result in, among other things, exposing us to liabilities of the joint venture in excess of our proportionate share of these liabilities. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer as a result.

 A significant portion of our assets are recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors, with assistance from the Manager and the Sub-Manager and, as a result, there will be uncertainty as to the value of our assets. 
 Our financial statements are prepared using the specialized accounting principles of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies, or ASC Topic 946, which requires us to carry our assets at fair value or, if fair value is not determinable based on transactions observable in the market, at fair value as determined by our board of directors. For most of our assets, market prices are not readily available. As a result, we value these assets monthly at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors based on input from the Manager, the Sub-Manager and the independent valuation firm. 
 Our board of directors is ultimately responsible for the determination, in good faith, of the fair value of our assets. The determination of fair value is subjective, and the Manager and the Sub-Manager have a conflict of interest in assisting our board of directors in making this determination. Our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors and our audit committee, has adopted a valuation policy that provides for the methodologies to be used to estimate the fair value of our assets for purposes of our net asset value calculation. Our board of directors makes this determination on a monthly basis and any other time when a decision is required regarding the fair value of our assets. Our board of directors has retained an independent valuation firm to assist the Manager and the Sub-Manager in preparing their recommendations with respect to our board of directors determination of the fair values of assets for which market prices are not readily available. The types of factors that may be considered in determining the fair values of our assets include available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the business s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer business entities that are public, mergers and acquisitions comparables, the principal market and enterprise values, among other factors. Because such valuations, and particularly valuations of private companies, are inherently uncertain, the valuations may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time due to changes in current market conditions. The determinations of fair value by our board of directors may differ materially from the values that would have been used if an active market and market prices existed for these assets. Our net asset value could be adversely affected if the determinations regarding the fair value of our assets were materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon the disposal of such assets. 
 We may experience fluctuations in our quarterly results. 
 We could experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to consummate transactions, the terms of any transactions that we complete, variations in the earnings and/or distributions paid by the businesses we make capital contributions and loans to, variations in the interest rates on loans we make, the level of our expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets and general economic conditions. As a result of these factors, results for any period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods. 
 We may experience fluctuations in our operating expenses. 
 We could experience fluctuations in our operating expenses due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, changes in inflation and the flow on effects on prices generally, the terms of any transactions that we complete, changes in operating conditions, changes to our operating environment, changes in the perception of risk associated with operating these assets. As a result of these factors, results for any period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods. 
 We will be exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates. 
 To the extent we borrow to finance our assets, we will be subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. As of this Annual Report, interest rates in the U.S. remain near historic lows, which may increase our exposure to risks associated with rising interest rates. An anticipated increase in interest rates, however, would make it more expensive to use debt for our financing needs. 
 When we borrow, our net income will depend, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we employ those funds. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net income. In periods of rising interest rates when we have floating-rate debt outstanding, our cost of funds may increase, which could reduce our net income. We expect that our long-term fixed-rate investments will be financed primarily with equity and long-term debt. We may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. These techniques may include borrowing at fixed rates or various interest rate hedging activities. These activities may limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the hedged portfolio. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Risks Related to Tax 
 Shareholders may realize taxable income without cash distributions, and may have to use funds from other sources to fund tax liabilities. 
 Because we intend to continue to be taxed as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, shareholders may realize taxable income in excess of cash distributions by us. There can be no assurance that we will pay distributions at a specific rate or at all. As a result, shareholders may have to use funds from other sources to pay their tax liability. 
 In addition, the payment of the distribution and shareholder servicing fees over time with respect to the Class T and Class D shares will be paid from cash distributions that would otherwise be distributable to the shareholders of Class T and Class D shares. Accordingly, the Class T and Class D shareholders will receive a lower cash distribution than the Class FA, Class A, Class I and Class S shareholders as a result of economically bearing our obligation to pay such fees. Additionally, since the management and incentive fees for the Non-founder shares are higher than the management and incentive fees for the Class FA shares, the non-founder shareholders will receive a lower cash distribution than the Class FA shareholders as a result of economically bearing a greater proportionate share of our obligation to pay such fees. The payment of such fees will be specially allocated to the class of shares that are bearing these fees. Some shareholders will not be able to deduct these fees for tax purposes, which may result in shareholders taxable income from the Company exceeding the amount of cash distributions made to such shareholders. 
 If we were to become taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would be required to pay income tax at corporate rates on our net income and would reduce the amount of cash available for distributions to our shareholders. Such distributions, if any, by us to shareholders would constitute dividend income taxable to such shareholders, to the extent of our earnings and profits. 
 Under Section 7704 of the Code, unless certain exceptions apply, a publicly traded partnership is generally treated and taxed as a corporation, and not as a partnership, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A partnership is a publicly traded partnership if (i) interests in the partnership are traded on an established securities market or (ii) interests in the partnership are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof. Applicable Treasury regulations (the Section 7704 Regulations provide guidance with respect to such classification standards, and create certain safe harbor standards which, if satisfied, generally preclude classification as a publicly traded partnership. Failure to satisfy a safe harbor provision under the Section 7704 Regulations will not cause an entity to be treated as a publicly traded partnership if, taking into account all facts and circumstances, the partners are not readily able to buy, sell or exchange their interests in a manner that is comparable, economically, to trading on an established securities market. 
 While it is expected that we will operate so that we will qualify to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a partnership, and not as an association or a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation, given the highly complex nature of the rules governing partnerships, the ongoing importance of factual determinations, the lack of direct guidance with respect to the application of tax laws to the activities we are undertaking and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, it is possible that we will not qualify to be taxable as a partnership for any particular year. Our shares will not be listed on an exchange or quoted through a national quotation system for the foreseeable future, if ever. Our LLC Agreement provides for certain restrictions on transferability and on our ability to repurchase shares intended to ensure that we qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that we are not taxable as a publicly traded partnership. Under our LLC Agreement, prior to a listing of our shares on a national securities exchange, no transfer (including any share repurchase) of an interest may be made if it would result in our being treated as a publicly traded partnership. In addition, we may, without the consent of any shareholder, amend our LLC Agreement in order to improve, upon advice of counsel, our position in avoiding such publicly traded partnership status (and we may impose time-delay and other restrictions on recognizing transfers (including any share repurchases) as necessary to do so).

 If we were treated as a publicly traded partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would nonetheless remain taxable as a partnership if 90 or more of our income for each taxable year in which we were a publicly traded partnership consisted of qualifying income and we were not required to register under the Investment Company Act (the qualifying income exception ). Qualifying income generally includes interest (other than interest generated from a financial business), dividends, real property rents, gain from the sale of assets that produce qualifying income and certain other items. Although there is no direct authority regarding whether activities similar to those conducted by us could be treated as a financial business for this purpose, the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, has issued private letter rulings to the effect that interest income on loans not made to customers in connection with a banking or other financing business is qualifying income for purposes of the publicly traded partnership rules. These private letter rulings are binding on the IRS only with respect to the particular taxpayers who requested and received those rulings and address only the specific facts presented by the requesting taxpayer; however, such authority nonetheless provides valuable indications of the IRS s views on specific issues. In addition, to the extent that we invest in levered loans through controlled foreign corporations (each, a CFC ), we intend to currently distribute any Subpart F inclusions and treat such Subpart F inclusions as qualifying income for purposes of the qualifying income exception. Since our gross income will largely consist of dividend and interest income from our subsidiaries and other portfolio companies, we expect to satisfy the qualifying income exception. However, no assurance can be given that the actual results of our operations for any taxable year will satisfy the qualifying income exception. 
 If, for any reason, we become taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our items of income and deduction would not pass through to our shareholders and our shareholders would be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as shareholders in a corporation. We would be required to pay income tax at corporate rates on our net income. Distributions by us to shareholders would constitute dividend income taxable to such shareholders, to the extent of our earnings and profits, and the payment of these distributions would not be deductible by us. Our failure to qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes could have a material adverse effect on us, our shareholders and the value of the shares. 
 The IRS could adjust or reallocate items of income, gain, deduction, loss and credit with respect to the shares if the IRS does not accept the assumptions or conventions utilized by us. 
 Although we are not a publicly traded partnership, given the large number of investors we anticipate will invest in us, we expect to apply conventions relevant to publicly traded partnerships. U.S. federal income tax rules applicable to partnerships are complex and their application is not always clear. We apply certain assumptions and conventions intended to comply with the intent of the rules and report income, gain, deduction, loss and credit to shareholders in a manner that reflects each shareholder s economic gains and losses, but these assumptions and conventions may not comply with all aspects of the applicable rules. It is possible therefore that the IRS will successfully assert that these assumptions or conventions do not satisfy the technical requirements of the Code or the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and will require that items of income, gain, deduction, loss and credit be adjusted or reallocated in a manner that could be adverse to shareholders. 
 Changes in tax laws and regulations may have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and result of operations and have a negative impact on our shareholders. 
 The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of an investment in our shares may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial interpretation at any time, and any such action may affect investments and commitments previously made. No assurance can be given as to whether, when, or in what form, the U.S. federal and state income tax laws applicable to us and our shareholders may be enacted. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential changes in tax laws. 
 Interest deductions on loans made to our subsidiaries and other portfolio companies may be limited, which could result in adverse tax consequences. 
 Our debt investments in our subsidiaries and other portfolio companies are intended to be treated as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS successfully recharacterized any of such debt investments as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, payments of interest with respect to such debt investment may be recharacterized as a dividend and would not be deductible by our subsidiary in computing its taxable income, resulting in the subsidiary potentially being subject to additional U.S. federal income tax. Even to the extent the debt investments are respected as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the deduction for interest payments by each of our subsidiaries with respect to such debt investments for any taxable year is generally limited to the sum of (i) such subsidiary's business interest income and (ii) 30 of the subsidiary's "adjusted taxable income", unless the subsidiary is an electing real property trade or business. To the extent interest deductions by our subsidiaries are limited, it could increase the U.S. federal income tax liability of our subsidiaries, reducing the amount of cash available for distribution to us, and, as a result, to our shareholders.

 There is no established public trading market for our common shares, therefore, there is a risk that a shareholder may not be able to sell our shares at a time or price acceptable to the shareholder, or at all. Unless and until our shares are listed on a national securities exchange, it is not expected that a public market for the shares will develop. 
 For the period from January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2022, we sold shares on a continuous basis at the following prices through the Initial Public Offering and Follow-On Public Offering:

 Repurchase of Shares and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 In March 2019, our board of directors approved and adopted a share repurchase program, as further amended and restated in January 2020, June 2021 and February 2023 (the Share Repurchase Program ). The total amount of aggregate repurchases of Class FA, Class A, Class T, Class D, Class I and Class S shares will be limited to up to 2.5 of the aggregate net asset value per calendar quarter (based on the aggregate net asset value as of the last date of the month immediately prior to the repurchase date) and up to 10 of the aggregate net asset value per year (based on the average aggregate net asset value as of the end of each of the Company s trailing four quarters). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the sole discretion of our board of directors, we may also use other sources, including, but not limited to, offering proceeds and borrowings to repurchase shares. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may amend or suspend the Share Repurchase Program or waive any of its specific conditions to the extent it is in our best interest, including to ensure our ability to qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Our board of directors approved the excess repurchase requests.

 Share Class Number of Shareholders FA 744 A 1,331 T 1,181 D 894 I 3,377 S 716 
 Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
 We have adopted a distribution reinvestment plan pursuant to which shareholders who purchase shares in the Public Offerings have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares having the same class designation as the class of shares to which such distributions are attributable, unless such shareholders elect to receive distributions in cash, are residents of Opt-In States, or are clients of certain participating broker-dealers that do not permit automatic enrollment in our distribution reinvestment plan. Opt-In States include Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Vermont and Washington. Shareholders who are residents of Opt-In States, holders of Class FA shares and clients of certain participating broker-dealers that do not permit automatic enrollment in our distribution reinvestment plan automatically receive their distributions in cash unless they elect to have their cash distributions reinvested in additional shares. Cash distributions paid on Class FA shares are reinvested in additional Class A shares. Class S shares do not participate in the distribution reinvestment plan. 
 The purchase price for shares purchased under our distribution reinvestment plan is equal to the most recently determined and published net asset value per share of the applicable class of shares. Because the distribution and shareholder servicing fee is calculated based on net asset value, it reduces net asset value and/or distributions with respect to Class T shares and Class D shares, including shares issued under the distribution reinvestment plan with respect to such share classes. To the extent newly issued shares are purchased from us under the distribution reinvestment plan or shareholders elect to reinvest their cash distribution in our shares, we retain and/or receive additional funds for acquisitions and general purposes including the repurchase of shares under the Share Repurchase Program. 
 We do not pay selling commissions or dealer manager fees on shares sold pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. However, the amount of the distribution and shareholder servicing fee payable with respect to Class T or Class D shares, respectively, sold in the Public Offerings is allocated among all Class T or Class D shares, respectively, including those sold under our distribution reinvestment plan and those received as distributions. 
 Our shareholders will be taxed on their allocable share of income, even if their distributions are reinvested in additional shares of our common shares and even if no distributions are made.

 Share Conversions 
 Class T and Class D shares are converted into Class A shares once the maximum amount of distribution and shareholder servicing fees for those particular shares has been met. The shares to be converted are multiplied by the applicable conversion rate, the numerator of which is the net asset value per share of the share class being converted and the denominator of which is the net asset value per Class A share. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 59,000 Class T shares were converted to approximately 59,000 Class A shares at an average conversion rate of 1.0. There were no share conversions during the year ended December 31, 2021.

 We are currently offering and selling shares under the Follow-On Public Offering pursuant to the Follow-On Registration Statement, which became effective on November 1, 2021.

 Our Common Shares Offerings 
 Public Offerings 
 On March 7, 2018, we commenced the Initial Public Offering of up to 1.1 billion of shares, which included up to 100.0 million of shares being offered through our distribution reinvestment plan, pursuant to the Initial Registration Statement. On November 1, 2021, we commenced the Follow-On Public Offering of up to 1.1 billion of shares, which includes up to 100.0 million of shares being offered through our distribution reinvestment plan, of our shares, upon which the Initial Registration Statement was deemed terminated. 
 Through December 31, 2022, we had received net proceeds from the Public Offerings of approximately 474.2 million, including approximately 15.5 million received through our distribution reinvestment plan. We incurred selling commissions and dealer manager fees of approximately 8.1 million from the sale of Class A shares and Class T shares in the Public Offerings through December 31, 2022. The Class D shares and Class I shares sold through December 31, 2022 were not subject to selling commissions and dealer manager fees. We also incurred obligations to reimburse the Manager and Sub-Manager for organization and offering costs of approximately 7.0 million based on actual amounts raised through the Public Offerings through December 31, 2022. These organization and offering costs related to the Public Offerings were advanced by the Manager and Sub-Manager, as described further in Note 5. Related Party Transactions of Item 8.

 Our Portfolio Companies 
 The below information regarding our portfolio companies contains financial measures utilized by management to evaluate the operating performance and liquidity of our portfolio companies that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). Each of these measures, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow FCF ), should not be considered in isolation from or as superior to or as a substitute for net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, or other financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to supplement our GAAP results in order to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our portfolio companies. We present these non-GAAP measures quarterly for our portfolio companies in which we own a controlling equity interest and annually for all of our portfolio companies. 
 You are encouraged to evaluate the adjustments to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted FCF, including the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted FCF, you should be aware that in the future our portfolio companies may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. The presentations of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted FCF should not be construed as an inference that the future results of our portfolio companies will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. 
 We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted FCF may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies, because not all companies calculate these non-GAAP measures in the same manner. Because of these limitations and additional limitations described below, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted FCF should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on the GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted FCF only as supplemental measures. 
 Additionally, we provide our proportionate share of each non-GAAP measure because our ownership percentage of each portfolio company varies. We urge investors to consider our ownership percentage of each portfolio company when evaluating the results of each of our portfolio companies. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 When evaluating the performance of our portfolio, we monitor Adjusted EBITDA to measure the financial and operational performance of our portfolio companies and their ability to pay contractually obligated debt payments to us. In connection with this evaluation, the Manager and Sub-Manager review monthly portfolio company operating performance versus budgeted expectations and conduct regular operational review calls with the management teams of the portfolio companies. 
 We present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of the performance of our portfolio companies because we believe it assists investors in comparing the performance of such businesses across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of their core operating performance. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), plus (i) interest expense, net, and loan cost amortization, (ii) taxes and (iii) depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted for certain other non-recurring items that we do not consider indicative of the ongoing operating performance of our portfolio companies. These further adjustments are itemized below. Our proportionate share of Adjusted EBITDA is calculated based on our equity ownership percentage at period end. 
 Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool. Some of these limitations are: (i) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; (iii) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on indebtedness; (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; (v) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we do not consider to be indicative of the ongoing operations of our portfolio companies; and (vi) other companies in similar industries as our portfolio companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

 Adjusted Free Cash Flow 
 We monitor Adjusted FCF to measure the liquidity of our portfolio companies. We present Adjusted FCF as a supplemental measure of the performance of our portfolio companies since such measure reflects the cash generated by the operating activities of our portfolio companies and to the extent such cash is not distributed to us, it generally represents cash used by the portfolio companies for the repayment of debt, investing in expansions or acquisitions, reserve requirements or other corporate uses by such portfolio companies, and such uses reduce our potential need to make capital contributions to the portfolio companies for our proportionate share of cash needed for such items. We use Adjusted FCF as a key factor in our planning for, and consideration of, acquisitions, the payment of distributions and share repurchases. 
 We define Adjusted FCF as cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, net of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, of our portfolio companies, as further adjusted for certain non-recurring items. These further adjustments are itemized below. Our proportionate share of Adjusted FCF is calculated based on our equity ownership percentage at period end. Adjusted FCF does not represent cash available to our Company except to the extent it is distributed to us, and to the extent actually distributed to us, we may not have control in determining the timing and amount of distributions from our portfolio companies, and therefore, we may not receive such cash. 
 Adjusted FCF has limitations as an analytical tool. Some of these limitations are: (i) Adjusted FCF does not account for future contractual commitments; (ii) Adjusted FCF excludes required debt service payments; (iii) Adjusted FCF does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we do not consider to be indicative of the on-going operations of our portfolio companies; and (iv) other companies in similar industries as our portfolio companies may calculate Adjusted FCF differently, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes or as an alternative to operating cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 Our aggregate proportionate share of Adjusted FCF from our portfolio company investments was approximately 13.8 million and 11.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As discussed above, cash not distributed to us is used by our portfolio companies for various reasons, including, but not limited to, repayment of debt, investing in acquisitions and general cash reserves.

 Factors Impacting Our Operating Results 
 We expect that the results of our operations will be affected by a number of factors. Many of the factors that will affect our operating results are beyond our control. We will be dependent upon the earnings of and cash flows from the businesses that we acquire to meet our operating and management fee expenses and to make distributions. These earnings and cash flows, net of any minority interests in these businesses, will be available: 
 first , to meet our management fees and corporate overhead expenses; and 
 second , to fund business operations and to make distributions to our shareholders. 
 COVID-19 
 The Company and the operations of its portfolio companies have not been materially adversely affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information regarding the risks of COVID-19. 
 Size of assets 
 If we are unable to raise substantial funds, we will be limited in the number and type of acquisitions we may make. The size of our assets will be a key revenue driver. Generally, as the size of our assets grows, the amount of income we receive will increase. In addition, our assets may grow at an uneven pace as opportunities to acquire assets may be irregularly timed, and the timing and extent of the Manager s and the Sub-Manager s success in identifying such opportunities, and our success in making acquisitions, cannot be predicted.

 Market conditions 
 From time to time, the global capital markets may experience periods of disruption and instability, as we have seen and continue to see with the recent public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters and geopolitical events, which could materially and adversely impact the broader financial and credit markets and reduce the availability of debt and equity capital. Furthermore, economic growth remains affected by inflationary pressure and supply chain related disruptions and could be slowed or halted by significant external events. Some of our portfolio companies have experienced supply chain related disruptions from time to time. In some instances, strategic decisions to hold more inventory have been made as a result of ongoing supply chain related disruptions. Significant changes or volatility in the capital markets have and may continue to have a negative effect on the valuations of our businesses and other assets. While all of our assets are likely to not be publicly traded, applicable accounting standards require us to assume as part of our valuation process that our assets are sold in a principal market to market participants (even if we plan on holding an asset long term or through its maturity) and impairments of the market values or fair market values of our assets, even if unrealized, must be reflected in our financial statements for the applicable period, which could result in significant reductions to our net asset value for the period. Significant changes in the capital markets may also affect the pace of our activity and the potential for liquidity events involving our assets. Thus, the illiquidity of our assets may make it difficult for us to sell such assets to access capital if required, and as a result, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded our assets if we were required to sell them for liquidity purposes. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments, fund and maintain our assets and operations, repay borrowings, make distributions to our shareholders and other general business needs. We will use significant cash to fund acquisitions, make additional investments in our portfolio companies, make distributions to our shareholders and fund our operations. Additionally, to the extent we have available cash we may make investments in short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. Our primary sources of cash will generally consist of: 
 the net proceeds from the Offerings; 
 distributions and interest earned from our assets; and 
 proceeds from sales of assets and principal repayments from our assets. 
 We expect we will have sufficient cash from current sources to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months. However, we may opt to supplement our equity capital and increase potential returns to our shareholders through the use of prudent levels of borrowings. We may use debt when the available terms and conditions are favorable to long-term investing and well-aligned with our business strategy. In light of the current economic environment, impacted by rising interest rates, record inflationary pressures due to global supply chain issues, a rise in energy prices and the impact of the recent public health crises, natural disasters and geopolitical events on the global economy, we are closely monitoring overall liquidity levels and changes in the business performance of our portfolio companies to be in a position to enact changes to ensure adequate liquidity going forward. 
 While we generally intend to hold our assets for the long term, certain assets may be sold in order to manage our liquidity needs, meet other operating objectives and adapt to market conditions. The timing and impact of future sales of our assets, if any, cannot be predicted with any certainty. 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had approximately 36.8 million and 58.7 million, respectively, of cash. Information related to the year ended December 31, 2020 is included in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 31, 2022. 
 Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Offerings . We received approximately 184.9 million and 163.0 million in net proceeds during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, from the Public Offerings, which excludes approximately 8.3 million and 4.2 million raised through our distribution reinvestment plan during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 827 million authorized common shares remaining for sale. 
 Operating Activities. We generated operating cash flows (excluding amounts related to investment activity) of approximately 22.1 million and 21.3 million, during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 53 

T a b l e o f Contents 

 The increase in operating cash flows (excluding amounts related to investment activity) for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily attributable to (i) an increase in interest income of approximately 9.7 million, (ii) an increase in distributions from portfolio companies of approximately 3.6 million, and (iii) a decrease in taxes paid of approximately 0.9 million, offset partially by (iv) an increase in amounts paid to related parties of approximately 12.4 million and (v) an increase in third-party operating expenses, net of changes in liabilities, of approximately 1.0 million. 
 Borrowings. We did not borrow any amounts during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The purpose of the Line of Credit is for general Company working capital and acquisition financing purposes. See Note 8. Borrowings of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the 2022 Line of Credit. 
 Uses of Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Investments. We used approximately 89.4 million and 192.8 million of cash to purchase portfolio company investments during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additionally, we used net cash of approximately 105.4 million to invest in U.S. Treasury Bills during the year ended December 31, 2022. Our U.S. Treasury Bills held at December 31, 2022 matured in January 2023 and we reinvested the proceeds from the redemptions in additional U.S. Treasury Bills. We did not invest in U.S. Treasury Bills during the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Distributions. We paid distributions to our shareholders of approximately 15.2 million and 10.8 million (which excludes distributions reinvested of approximately 8.3 million and 4.2 million, respectively) during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Distributions Declared below for additional information. 
 Share Repurchases. We paid approximately 18.7 million and 4.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, to repurchase shares in accordance with our Share Repurchase Program. 
 Deferred Financing Costs. We paid approximately 0.20 million and 0.02 million in deferred financing costs during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Reimbursement of Expense Support. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we reimbursed the Manager and Sub-Manager approximately 1.8 million for Expense Support received in previous years. The Manager and Sub-Manager have provided approximately 3.2 million of Expense Support that had not been reimbursed as of December 31, 2022, of which approximately 2.4 million was accrued as of December 31, 2022 and paid in January 2023. Expense Support is received or Expense Support reimbursement is paid annually in arrears. As of December 31, 2022, management believes that reimbursement payments by the Company to the Manager and Sub-Manager for the remaining unreimbursed Expense Support in excess of amounts accrued are not probable under the terms of the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement. Our obligation to make Conditional Reimbursements will automatically terminate and be of no further effect three years following the date which the Expense Support amount was provided and to which such Conditional Reimbursement relates, as described further in the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement. See Note 5. Related Party Transactions of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information.

 (1) Represents percentage of cash distributions declared, net of distribution reinvested for the period presented. 
 (2) Consists of offering proceeds for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 (3) Excludes 7,794 and 4,429 of distributions reinvested pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Distribution amounts and sources of distributions declared vary among share classes. We calculate each shareholder s specific distribution amount for the period using record and declaration dates. Distributions are declared on all classes of our shares at the same time. Amounts distributed to each class are allocated among the holders of our shares in such class in proportion to their shares. Distributions on the Non-founder shares may be lower than distributions on Founder shares because we are required to pay higher management and total return incentive fees to the Manager and the Sub-Manager with respect to the Non-founder shares. Additionally, distributions on Class T and Class D shares are lower than distributions on Class FA, Class A, Class I and Class S shares because we are required to pay ongoing distribution and shareholder servicing fees with respect to Class T and Class D shares. There is no assurance that we will pay distributions in any particular amount, if at all. 
 See Note 6. Distributions in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional disclosures regarding distributions. 
 Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
 We have adopted a distribution reinvestment plan pursuant to which shareholders who purchase shares in the Public Offerings have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares having the same class designation as the class of shares to which such distributions are attributable, unless such shareholders elect to receive distributions in cash, are residents of Opt-In States, or are clients of certain participating broker-dealers that do not permit automatic enrollment in our distribution reinvestment plan. Opt-In States include Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Vermont and Washington. Shareholders who are residents of Opt-In States, holders of Class FA shares and clients of certain participating broker-dealers that do not permit automatic enrollment in our distribution reinvestment plan automatically receive their distributions in cash unless they elect to have their cash distributions reinvested in additional shares. Cash distributions paid on Class FA shares are reinvested in additional Class A shares. Class S shares do not participate in the distribution reinvestment plan. 
 The purchase price for shares purchased under our distribution reinvestment plan is equal to the most recently determined and published net asset value per share of the applicable class of shares. Because the distribution and shareholder servicing fee is calculated based on net asset value, it reduces net asset value and/or distributions with respect to Class T shares and Class D shares, including shares issued under the distribution reinvestment plan with respect to such share classes. To the extent newly issued shares are purchased from us under the distribution reinvestment plan or shareholders elect to reinvest their cash distribution in our shares, we retain and/or receive additional funds for acquisitions and general purposes including the repurchase of shares under the Share Repurchase Program. 
 We do not pay selling commissions or dealer manager fees on shares sold pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. However, the amount of the distribution and shareholder servicing fee payable with respect to Class T or Class D shares, respectively, sold in the Public Offerings is allocated among all Class T or Class D shares, respectively, including those sold under our distribution reinvestment plan and those received as distributions. 
 Our shareholders will be taxed on their allocable share of income, even if their distributions are reinvested in additional shares of our common shares and even if no distributions are made.

 Share Repurchase Program 
 We adopted the Share Repurchase Program effective March 2019, as amended, pursuant to which we conduct quarterly share repurchases to allow our shareholders to sell all or a portion of their shares (at least 5 of his or her shares) back to us at a price equal to the net asset value per share of the month immediately prior to the repurchase date. The repurchase date is generally the last business day of the month of a calendar quarter end. We are not obligated to repurchase shares under the Share Repurchase Program. If we determine to repurchase shares, the Share Repurchase Program also limits the total amount of aggregate repurchases of Class FA, Class A, Class T, Class D, Class I and Class S shares to up to 2.5 of our aggregate net asset value per calendar quarter (based on the aggregate net asset value as of the last date of the month immediately prior to the repurchase date) and up to 10 of our aggregate net asset value per year (based on the average aggregate net asset value as of the end of each of our trailing four quarters). The Share Repurchase Program also includes certain restrictions on the timing, amount and terms of our repurchases intended to ensure our ability to qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 The aggregate amount of funds under the Share Repurchase Program is determined on a quarterly basis at the sole discretion of our board of directors. At the sole discretion of our board of directors, we may also use other sources, including, but not limited to, offering proceeds and borrowings to repurchase shares. 
 To the extent that the number of shares submitted to us for repurchase exceeds the number of shares that we are able to purchase, we will repurchase shares on a pro rata basis, from among the requests for repurchase received by us based upon the total number of shares for which repurchase was requested and the order of priority described in the Share Repurchase Program. We may repurchase shares including fractional shares, computed to three decimal places. 
 Under the Share Repurchase Program, our ability to make new acquisitions of businesses or increase the current distribution rate may become limited if, over any two-year period, we experience repurchase demand in excess of capacity. If, during any consecutive two year period, we do not have at least one quarter in which we fully satisfy 100 of properly submitted repurchase requests, we will not make any new acquisitions of businesses (excluding short-term cash management investments under 90 days in duration) and we will use all available investable assets (as defined below) to satisfy repurchase requests (subject to the limitations under the Share Repurchase Program) until all Unfulfilled Repurchase Requests have been satisfied. Additionally, during such time as there remains any Unfulfilled Repurchase Requests outstanding from such period, the Manager and the Sub-Manager will defer their total return incentive fee until all such Unfulfilled Repurchase Requests have been satisfied. Investable assets includes net proceeds from new subscription agreements, unrestricted cash, proceeds from marketable securities, proceeds from the distribution reinvestment plan, and net cash flows after any payment, accrual, allocation, or liquidity reserves or other business costs in the normal course of owning, operating or selling our acquired businesses, debt service, repayment of debt, debt financing costs, current or anticipated debt covenants, funding commitments related to our businesses, customary general and administrative expenses, customary organizational and offering costs, asset management and advisory fees, performance or actions under existing contracts, obligations under our organizational documents or those of our subsidiaries, obligations imposed by law, regulations, courts or arbitration, or distributions or establishment of an adequate liquidity reserve as determined by our board of directors. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we received requests for the repurchase of approximately 20.5 million of our common shares, which exceeded amounts available for repurchase under the Share Repurchase Program by approximately 13.6 million. Our board of directors approved the excess repurchase requests received for the year ended December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we received requests for the repurchase of approximately 3.3 million of our common shares, which did not exceed amounts available for repurchase under the Share Repurchase Program . 
 The following table summarizes the shares repurchased during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands except per share data):

Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. 
 Through December 31, 2022, we had acquired equity and debt investments in eleven portfolio companies using the net proceeds from our Offerings. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of our portfolio company investments totaled approximately 588.8 million and 456.0 million, respectively. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, we had invested in U.S. Treasury Bills with a fair value of 106.2 million. We did not have investments in U.S. Treasury Bills as of December 31, 2021. See Portfolio and Investment Activity above for discussion of the general terms and characteristics of our investments and for information regarding our portfolio companies. 
 The following table summarizes our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): 
 Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Total investment income 46,956 31,471 Total operating expenses (27,710) (17,917) Reimbursement of expense support (2,449) (1,831) Net investment income before taxes 16,797 11,723 Income tax expense (81) (1,630) Net investment income 16,716 10,093 Net change in unrealized appreciation on investments 41,349 32,893 Net increase in net assets resulting from operations 58,065 42,986 
 Investment Income 
 Investment income consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): 
 Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 From portfolio company investments: Interest income 26,083 17,190 Dividend income 19,983 14,172 From U.S. treasury bills and cash accounts: Interest income 890 109 Total investment income 46,956 31,471 
 Interest income from portfolio company investments is generated from our senior secured note investments, all of which had fixed rate interest as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our weighted average annual yield on our accruing debt investments was 15.2 and 15.3 , respectively, based on amortized cost as defined above in Portfolio and Investment Activity. The increase in interest income from portfolio company investments during the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, is primarily attributable to receiving a full year of interest income on debt investments acquired in 2021 of approximately 74.5 million and an additional debt investment during the year ended December 31, 2022 of approximately 24.4 million. 
 Dividend income from portfolio company investments is recorded on the record date for privately issued securities, but excludes any portion of distributions that are treated as a return of capital. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we received dividend income from nine of our portfolio companies, as compared to dividend income from four of our portfolio companies during the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Our total investment income from portfolio company investments for the year ended December 31, 2022, resulted in cash yields ranging from 2.6 to 16.6 based on our investment cost, as compared to 0.3 to 16.0 for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 We began investing in U.S. Treasury Bills in August 2022 to earn a higher rate of interest on our available cash. From August 2022 to December 31, 2022, our effective yield on U.S. Treasury Bills ranged from 2.1 to 3.9 . 
 57 

T a b l e o f Contents 

 We do not believe that our interest income, dividend income and total investment income are representative of either our stabilized performance or our future performance. We expect investment income to increase in future periods as we increase our base of assets that we expect to acquire from existing cash, borrowings and an expected increase in capital available for investment using proceeds from the Public Offerings. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in thousands): 
 Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Total return incentive fees 11,456 7,283 Base management fees 8,941 4,845 Offering expenses 2,814 2,552 Professional services 1,881 1,344 Pursuit costs 764 651 Distribution and shareholder servicing fees 789 397 Custodian and accounting fees 335 235 General and administrative expenses 298 174 Insurance expense 227 233 Director fees and expenses 205 203 Total operating expenses 27,710 17,917 Reimbursement of Expense Support 2,449 1,831 Net operating expenses 30,159 19,748 
 We consider the following expense categories to be relatively fixed in the near term: insurance expenses and director fees and expenses. Variable operating expenses include total return incentive fees, base management fees, organization and offering expenses, professional services, distribution and shareholder servicing fees, custodian and accounting fees, general and administrative expenses and pursuit costs. We expect these variable operating expenses to increase in connection with the growth in our asset base (base management fees, total return incentive fees, accounting fees and general and administrative expenses), the number of shareholders and open accounts (professional services, distribution and shareholder servicing fees and custodian and accounting fees), and/or the complexity of our investment processes and capital structure (professional services). 
 Total Return Incentive Fee 
 The Manager and Sub-Manager are eligible to receive incentive fees based on the Total Return to Shareholders, as defined in the Management Agreement and Sub-Management Agreement, for each share class in any calendar year, payable annually in arrears. We accrue (but do not pay) the total return incentive fee on a quarterly basis, to the extent that it is earned, and perform a final reconciliation at completion of each calendar year. The total return incentive fee is due and payable to the Manager and Sub-Manager no later than ninety (90) calendar days following the end of the applicable calendar year. The total return incentive fee may be reduced or deferred by the Manager and the Sub-Manager under the Management Agreement and the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement. 
 We incurred total return incentive fees of approximately 11.5 million and 7.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in total return incentive fees during the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, is primarily due to an increase in net investment income and an increase in the net change in unrealized appreciation on investments. 
 Base Management Fee 
 Our base management fee is calculated for each share class at an annual rate of (i) for the Non-founder shares, 2 of the product of (x) our average gross assets and (y) the ratio of Non-founder share Average Adjusted Capital for a particular class to total Average Adjusted Capital and (ii) for the Founder shares, 1 of the product of (x) our average gross assets and (y) the ratio of outstanding Founder share Average Adjusted Capital to total Average Adjusted Capital, in each case excluding cash, and is payable monthly in arrears. 
 We incurred base management fees of approximately 8.9 million and 4.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in base management fees is primarily attributable to the increase in our average gross assets (excluding cash and U.S. Treasury Bills) which were approximately 530.0 million and 318.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

 Offering Expenses 
 Offering expenses, which consist of amounts incurred for items such as legal, accounting, regulatory and printing work incurred related to the Public Offerings, are capitalized on our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities as deferred offering expenses and expensed to our consolidated statements of operations over the lesser of the offering period or 12 months; however, the end of the deferral period will not exceed 12 months from the date the offering expense is incurred by the Manager and the Sub-Manager. We incurred offering expenses of approximately 2.8 million and 2.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Pursuit Costs 
 Pursuit costs relate to transactional expenses incurred to identify, evaluate and negotiate acquisitions that ultimately were not consummated. We incurred pursuit costs of approximately 0.8 million and 0.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Distribution and Shareholder Servicing Fees 
 The Managing Dealer is eligible to receive a distribution and shareholder servicing fee, subject to certain limits, with respect to our Class T and Class D shares sold in the Public Offerings (excluding Class T shares and Class D shares sold through our distribution reinvestment plan and those received as share distributions) in an amount equal to 1.00 and 0.50 , respectively, of the current net asset value per share. 
 We incurred distribution and shareholder servicing fees of approximately 0.8 million and 0.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in distribution and shareholder servicing fees during the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, is attributable to an increase in Class T and Class D shares outstanding. 
 Other Operating Expenses 
 Other operating expenses (consisting of professional services, insurance expense, custodian and accounting fees, director fees and expenses, and general and administrative expenses) were approximately 2.9 million and 2.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in other operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, is primarily attributable to an increase in custodian, accounting, legal, tax and valuation professional services resulting from an increase in the number of shareholders and investments. 
 Reimbursement of Expense Support 
 We have entered into an Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement with the Manager and the Sub-Manager, pursuant to which each of the Manager and the Sub-Manager agrees to reduce the payment of base management fees, total return incentive fees and the reimbursements of reimbursable expenses due to the Manager and the Sub-Manager under the Management Agreement and the Sub-Management Agreement, as applicable, to the extent that our annual regular cash distributions exceed our annual net income (with certain adjustments). Expense Support is equal to the annual (calendar year) excess, if any, of (a) the distributions (as defined in the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement) declared and paid (net of our distribution reinvestment plan) to shareholders minus (b) the available operating funds (the Expense Support ). The Expense Support amount is borne equally by the Manager and the Sub-Manager and is calculated as of the last business day of the calendar year. The Manager and Sub-Manager equally conditionally reduce the payment of fees and reimbursements of reimbursable expenses in an amount equal to the conditional waiver amount (as defined in and subject to limitations described in the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement). The term of the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement has the same initial term and renewal terms as the Management Agreement or the Sub-Management Agreement, as applicable to the Manager or the Sub-Manager. 
 If, on the last business day of the calendar year, the annual (calendar year) year-to-date available operating funds exceeds the sum of the annual (calendar year) year-to-date distributions paid per share class (the Excess Operating Funds ), we will use such Excess Operating Funds to pay the Manager and the Sub-Manager all or a portion of the outstanding unreimbursed Expense Support amounts for each share class, as applicable, subject to the Conditional Reimbursements as described further in the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement. Our obligation to make Conditional Reimbursements shall automatically terminate and be of no further effect three years following the date which the Expense Support amount was provided and to which such Conditional Reimbursement relates, as described further in the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement.

T a b l e o f Contents 

 Since inception, we have received cumulative Expense Support of 5.1 million. Expense Support (reimbursement) totaled approximately 2.4 million) and 1.8 million) during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The actual amount of Expense Support or Expense Support reimbursement is determined as of the last business day of each calendar year and is paid within 90 days after each year end per the terms of the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement described above. See Note 5. Related Party Transactions of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information, including the maximum amount of Expense Support that may become reimbursable during the year ending December 31, 2023. 
 Other Expenses and Changes in Net Assets 
 Income Tax Expense 
 We incur income tax expense to the extent we have or expect to have taxable income or loss for the current year related to our Taxable Subsidiaries. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded current income tax expense of approximately 0.1 million and 1.6 million, respectively. Additionally, we recorded a provision for deferred taxes on investments of approximately 2.4 million and 1.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, primarily related to unrealized appreciation on investments held by our Taxable Subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022, three of our equity investments were held in Taxable Subsidiaries, as compared to two equity investments held in Taxable Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2021. 
 The table below presents a reconciliation of tax expense the Company would be subject to if it were taxed as a corporation to the Company s actual income tax expense incurred by its Taxable Subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): 
 Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Tax expense computed at the federal statutory rate 12,708 21.0 9,707 21.0 State income tax expense net of federal benefit 214 0.4 789 1.7 Benefit of partnership structure (10,471) (17.3) (7,256) (15.7) Income tax expense 2,451 4.1 3,240 7.0 
 The effective tax rate will fluctuate from year to year as the amount of taxable income (or loss) at our Taxable Subsidiaries fluctuates in relation to the Company s net income. 
 Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation on Portfolio Company Investments 
 Unrealized appreciation on portfolio company investments is based on the current fair value of our investments as determined by our board of directors based on inputs from the Sub-Manager and our independent valuation firm and consistent with our valuation policy, which take into consideration, among other factors, actual results of our portfolio companies in comparison to budgeted results for the year, future growth prospects, and the valuations of publicly traded comparable companies as determined by our independent valuation firm. 
 During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized a net change in unrealized appreciation on our portfolio company investments of approximately 43.7 million and 34.5 million, respectively, primarily due to EBITDA growth in a majority of our portfolio companies. EBITDA growth is partially attributable to accretive add-on acquisitions made by our portfolio companies, described above under Portfolio and Investment Activity Our Portfolio Companies. 
 Net Assets 
 During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the net increase in net assets consisted of the following: 
 Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Operations 58,065 42,986 Distributions to shareholders (21,911) (15,489) Capital transactions 172,636 163,850 Net increase in net assets 208,790 191,347 
 Operations increased by approximately 15.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in operations was primarily due to an increase of approximately 8.5 million in the net change in unrealized appreciation on investments and an increase of approximately 6.6 million in net investment income during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 60 

T a b l e o f Contents 

 Distributions increased approximately 6.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of an increase in shares outstanding. 
 Capital share transactions increased approximately 8.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due an increase in net proceeds received through our Offerings of approximately 21.9 million and an increase of approximately 4.1 million in amounts received through our distribution reinvestment plan, which was offset partially by an increase in share repurchases of approximately 17.2 million under the Share Repurchase Program. 
 Total Returns 
 The following table illustrates year-to-date YTD ), trailing 36 months Three Year ), Average Annual Return AAR and cumulative total returns with and without upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees sales load ), as applicable. All total returns with sales load assume full upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees. Total returns are calculated for each share class as the change in the net asset value for such share class during the period and assuming all distributions are reinvested. Class FA assumes distributions are reinvested in Class A shares and all other share classes assume distributions are reinvested in the same share class. Management believes total return is a useful measure of the overall investment performance of our shares.

 We are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, favorable or unfavorable, that may be reasonably anticipated to have a material impact on either capital resources or the revenues or income to be derived from our investments, other than those described above and the risk factors identified in Item 1A in Part I of this Annual Report, including the negative impacts from recent public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic and variants thereof, natural disasters and geopolitical events. 
 Our shares are illiquid investments for which there currently is no secondary market. Investors should not expect to be able to resell their shares regardless of how we perform. If investors are able to sell their shares, they will likely receive less than their purchase price. Our net asset value and total returns which are based in part upon determinations of fair value of Level 3 investments by our board of directors, not active market quotations are inherently uncertain. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data reported above. 

Hedging Activities 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had not entered into any derivatives or other financial instruments. With respect to any potential financings, general increases in interest rates over time may cause the interest expense associated with our borrowings to increase, and the value of our debt investments to decline. We may seek to stabilize our financing costs as well as any potential decline in our assets by entering into derivatives, swaps or other financial products in an attempt to hedge our interest rate risk. In the event we pursue any assets outside of the United States we may have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We may in the future, enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge any such foreign currency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the impact hedging activities may have on our results of operations. 

Seasonality 
 We do not anticipate that seasonality will have a significant effect on our results of operations.

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
 Our most critical accounting policies involve decisions and assessments that could affect our reported assets and liabilities, as well as our reported revenues and expenses. We believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our financial statements are based are reasonable at the time made and based upon information available to us at that time. Our critical accounting policies and accounting estimates will be expanded over time as we continue to implement our business and operating strategy. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Those material accounting policies and estimates that we expect to be most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition, as well as those that require complex judgment decisions by our management, are discussed below. 
 Basis of Presentation 
 Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, assumptions and the exercise of subjective judgment as to future uncertainties. In the opinion of management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that are necessary for the fair presentation of financial results as of and for the periods presented. 
 Although we are organized and intend to conduct our business in a manner so that we are not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our financial statements are prepared using the specialized accounting principles of ASC Topic 946 to utilize investment company accounting. We obtain funds through the issuance of equity interests to multiple unrelated investors, and provide such investors with investment management services. Further, our business strategy is to acquire interests in middle-market businesses to provide current income and long term capital appreciation, while protecting invested capital. Overall, we believe that the use of investment company accounting on a fair value basis is consistent with the management of our assets on a fair value basis, and make our financial statements more useful to investors and other financial statement users in facilitating the evaluation of an investment in us as compared to other investment products in the marketplace. 
 Valuation of Investments 
 We have adopted, and our valuation policy is performed in accordance with, ASC Topic 820, as described in Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. As of December 31, 2022, our U.S. Treasury Bill investments were categorized as Level 1 and all of our portfolio company investments were categorized as Level 3. 
 U.S. Treasury Bill investments are recorded at fair value based on the average of the bid and ask quotes for identical instruments. 
 Our portfolio company investments are valued utilizing a market approach, an income approach (i.e. discounted cash flow approach), a transaction approach, or a combination of such approaches, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices, including third party indicative broker quotes, and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The transaction approach uses pricing indications derived from recent precedent merger and acquisition transactions involving comparable target companies. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) that are discounted based on a required or expected discount rate to derive a single present value amount. The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors we may take into account to determine the fair value of our investments include, as relevant: available current market data, including an assessment of the credit quality of the security s issuer, relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, illiquidity discounts, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, data derived from merger and acquisition activities for comparable companies, and enterprise values, among other factors.

T a b l e o f Contents 

 Our board of directors is responsible for determining in good faith the fair value of the Company s Level 2 and Level 3 investments in accordance with the valuation policy and procedures approved by the board of directors, based on, among other factors, the input of the Manager, the Sub-Manager, our audit committee, and the independent third-party valuation firm. The determination of the fair value of our Level 2 and Level 3 assets requires judgment, which include assets for which market prices are not available. For most of our assets, market prices will not be available. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of assets that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the assets may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such assets, and the differences could be material. Because the calculation of our net asset value is based, in part, on the fair value of our assets, our calculation of net asset value is subjective and could be adversely affected if the determinations regarding the fair value of its assets were materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon the disposal of such assets. Furthermore, through the valuation process, our board of directors may determine that the fair value of the Company s Level 2 and Level 3 assets differs materially from the values that were provided by the independent valuation firm. 
 U.S. Federal and State Income Taxes 
 We believe that we are properly characterized as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and expect to continue to qualify as a partnership, and not be treated as a publicly traded partnership or otherwise be treated as a taxable corporation, for such purposes. As a partnership, we are generally not subject to U.S. federal and state income tax at the entity level. However, the Company holds certain equity investments in Taxable Subsidiaries. The Taxable Subsidiaries permit the Company to hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are pass through entities for tax purposes. The Taxable Subsidiaries are not consolidated with the Company for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, benefit, and the related tax assets and liabilities, as a result of the Taxable Subsidiaries ownership of certain portfolio investments. The income tax expense, or benefit, if any, and related tax assets and liabilities are reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We anticipate that our primary market risks will be related to the credit quality of our counterparties, market interest rates and changes in exchange rates. We will seek to manage these risks while, at the same time, seeking to provide an opportunity to shareholders to realize attractive returns through ownership of our shares. Many of these risks have been magnified due to the continuing uncertainties caused by the recent public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic and variants thereof, natural disasters and geopolitical events; however, while we continue to monitor the pandemic, its impact on such risks remains uncertain and difficult to predict. 
 Credit Risk 
 We expect to encounter credit risk relating to (i) the businesses and other assets we acquire and (ii) our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms. We will seek to mitigate this risk by deploying a comprehensive review and asset selection process, including scenario analysis, and careful ongoing monitoring of our acquired businesses and other assets as well as mitigation of negative credit effects through back up planning. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur, which could adversely impact our operating results. 
 Changes in Market Interest Rates 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Our debt investments are currently structured with fixed interest rates. Returns on investments that carry fixed rates are not subject to fluctuations in payments we receive from our borrowers, and will not adjust should rates move up or down. However, the fair value of our debt investments may be negatively impacted by rising interest rates. We may also invest in floating interest rate debt investments in the future. 
 We had not borrowed any money as of December 31, 2022. However, to the extent that we borrow money to make investments, our net investment income will be partially dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds may increase, which may reduce our net investment income. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 Exchange Rate Sensitivity 
 At December 31, 2022, we were not exposed to any foreign currency exchange rate risks that could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Although we do not have any foreign operations, some of the portfolio companies we invest in conduct business in foreign jurisdictions and therefore our investments have an indirect exposure to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of CNL Strategic Capital, LLC 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of assets and liabilities of CNL Strategic Capital, LLC (the Company), including the consolidated schedules of investments, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations, changes in its net assets, and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 (1) Discount rates are relative to the enterprise value of the portfolio companies and are not the market yields on the associated debt investments. Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the investments. 
 (2) This column represents the directional change in the fair value of the Level 3 investments that would result from an increase to the corresponding unobservable input. A decrease to the input would have the opposite effect. Significant changes in these inputs in isolation could result in significantly higher or lower fair value measurements. 
 The preceding tables include the significant unobservable inputs as they relate to the Company s determination of fair values for its investments categorized within Level 3 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. In addition to the techniques and inputs noted in the tables above, according to the Company s valuation policy, the Company may also use other valuation techniques and methodologies when determining the fair value estimates for the Company s investments. Any significant increases or decreases in the unobservable inputs would result in significant increases or decreases in the fair value of the Company s investments. 
 Investments that do not have a readily available market value are valued utilizing a market approach, an income approach (i.e. discounted cash flow approach), a transaction approach, or a combination of such approaches, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices, including third party indicative broker quotes, and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The transaction approach uses pricing indications derived from recent precedent merger and acquisition transactions involving comparable target companies. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) that are discounted based on a required or expected discount rate to derive a present value amount range. The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors the Company may take into account to determine the fair value of its investments include, as relevant: available current market data, including an assessment of the credit quality of the security s issuer, relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, illiquidity discounts, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, data derived from merger and acquisition activities for comparable companies, and enterprise values, among other factors.

 of the cumulative gross proceeds from the Public Offerings. The Company incurred an obligation to reimburse the Manager and Sub-Manager for approximately million and million in organization and offering costs based on actual amounts raised through the Public Offerings during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Manager and the Sub-Manager had incurred additional organization and offering costs of approximately million on behalf of the Company in connection with the Public Offerings in excess of the reimbursement limitation. These costs will be recognized by the Company in future periods as the Company receives future offering proceeds from the Follow-On Public Offering to the extent such costs are within the limitation. 
 Base Management Fee to Manager and Sub-Manager The Company pays each of the Manager and the Sub-Manager of the total base management fee for their services under the Management Agreement and the Sub-Management Agreement, subject to any reduction or deferral of any such fees pursuant to the terms of the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement described below. The Company incurred base management fees of approximately million and million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 The base management fee is calculated for each share class at an annual rate of (i) for the Non-founder shares of a particular class, of the product of (x) the Company s average gross assets and (y) the ratio of Non-founder shares Average Adjusted Capital (as defined below), for a particular class to total Average Adjusted Capital and (ii) for the Founder shares of a particular class, of the product of (x) the Company s average gross assets and (y) the ratio of outstanding Founder shares Average Adjusted Capital for a particular class to total Average Adjusted Capital, in each case excluding cash, and is payable monthly in arrears. The management fee for a certain month is calculated based on the average value of the Company s gross assets at the end of that month and the immediately preceding calendar month. The determination of gross assets reflects changes in the fair market value of the Company s assets, which does not necessarily equal their notional value, reflecting both realized and unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The base management fee may be reduced or deferred by the Manager and the Sub-Manager under the Management Agreement and the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement described below. For purposes of this calculation, Average Adjusted Capital for an applicable class is computed on the daily Adjusted Capital for such class for the actual number of days in such applicable month. Adjusted Capital is defined as cumulative proceeds generated from sales of the Company s shares of a particular share class (including proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan, if any), net of upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees sales load ), if any, reduced for the full amounts paid for share repurchases pursuant to any share repurchase program, if any, and adjusted for share conversions, if any, for such class. 
 Total Return Incentive Fee on Income to the Manager and Sub-Manager The Company also pays each of the Manager and the Sub-Manager of the total return incentive fee for their services under the Management Agreement and the Sub-Management Agreement. The Company recorded total return incentive fees of approximately million and million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 The total return incentive fee is based on the Total Return to Shareholders (as defined below) for each share class in any calendar year, payable annually in arrears. The Company accrues (but does not pay) the total return incentive fee on a quarterly basis, to the extent that it is earned, and performs a final reconciliation and makes required payments at completion of each calendar year. The total return incentive fee may be reduced or deferred by the Manager and the Sub-Manager under the Management Agreement and the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement described below. For purposes of this calculation, Total Return to Shareholders for any calendar quarter is calculated for each share class as the change in the net asset value for such share class plus total distributions for such share class calculated based on the Average Adjusted Capital for such class as of such calendar quarter end. The terms Total Return to Non-founder Shareholders and Total Return to Founder Shareholders means the Total Return to Shareholders specifically attributable to each particular share class of Non-founder shares or Founder shares, as applicable. 
 The total return incentive fee for each share class is calculated as follows: 
 No total return incentive fee will be payable in any calendar year in which the annual Total Return to Shareholders of a particular share class does not exceed (the Annual Preferred Return ).

 , or the Non-founder breakpoint, in any calendar year, will be payable to the Manager Non-founder Catch Up ). The Non-Founder Catch Up is intended to provide an incentive fee of of the Total Return to Non-founder Shareholders of a particular share class once the Total Return to Non-founder Shareholders of a particular class exceeds in any calendar year. 
 As it relates to Founder shares, all of the Total Return to Founder Shareholders with respect to each particular share class of Founder shares, if any, that exceeds the annual preferred return, but is less than or equal to , or the founder breakpoint, in any calendar year, will be payable to the Manager Founder Catch Up ). The Founder Catch Up is intended to provide an incentive fee of of the Total Return to Founder Shareholders of a particular share class once the Total Return to Founder Shareholders of a particular class exceeds in any calendar year. 
 For any quarter in which the Total Return to Shareholders of a particular share class exceeds the relevant breakpoint, the total return incentive fee of a particular share class shall equal, for Non-founder shares, of the Total Return to Non-founder Shareholders of a particular class, and for Founder shares, of the Total Return to Founder Shareholders of a particular class, in each case because the annual preferred and relevant catch ups will have been achieved. 
 For purposes of calculating the Total Return to Shareholders, the change in the Company s net asset value is subject to a High Water Mark. The High Water Mark is equal to the highest year-end net asset value, for each share class of the Company since inception, adjusted for any special distributions resulting from the sale of the Company s assets, provided such adjustment is approved by the Company s board of directors. If, as of each calendar year end, the Company s net asset value for the applicable share class is (A) above the High Water Mark, then, for such calendar year, the Total Return to Shareholders calculation will include the increase in the Company s net asset value for such share class in excess of the High Water Mark, and (B) if the Company s net asset value for the applicable share class is below the High Water Mark, for such calendar year, (i) any increase in the Company s per share net asset value will be disregarded in the calculation of Total Return to Shareholders for such share class while (ii) any decrease in the Company s per share net asset value will be included in the calculation of Total Return to Shareholders for such share class. 
 December 31, 2021 
 For purposes of this calculation, Average Adjusted Capital for an applicable class is computed on the daily Adjusted Capital for such class for the actual number of days in such applicable quarter. The annual preferred return of and the relevant breakpoints of and , respectively, are also adjusted for the actual number of days in each calendar year, measured as of each calendar quarter end.

 (1) The per share amounts presented are based on weighted average shares outstanding during the period. 
 (2) The amount shown at this caption is the balancing figure derived from the other figures in the schedule. The amount shown at this caption for a share outstanding throughout the period may not agree with the change in the aggregate gains and losses in portfolio investments for the period because of the timing of sales and repurchases of the Company s shares in relation to fluctuating fair values for the portfolio investments. 
 (3) The per share data for distributions is the actual amount of distributions paid or payable per common share outstanding during the entire period; distributions per share are rounded to the nearest 0.01. 
 (4) The computation of average net assets during the period is based on net assets measured at each month end, adjusted for capital contributions or withdrawals during the month. 
 (5) Total investment return is calculated for each share class as the change in the net asset value for such share class during the period and assuming all distributions are reinvested. Class FA assumes distributions are reinvested in Class A shares and all other share classes assume distributions are reinvested in the same share class, including Class S shares which do not participate in the distribution reinvestment plan. Amounts are not annualized and are not representative of total return as calculated for purposes of the total return incentive fee described in Note 5. Related Party Transactions. Since there is no public market for the Company s shares, terminal market value per share is assumed to be equal to net asset value per share on the last day of the period presented. The Company s performance changes over time and currently may be different than that shown above. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Independent Auditor s Report 

Board of Directors 
 LD Parent, Inc. 
 Holmdel, NJ 
 
 Opinion 
 
 We have audited the consolidated financial statements of LD Parent, Inc. and its Subsidiaries (the Company), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholder s equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
 
 Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements 
 
 Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
 In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued or available to be issued.

 Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
 
 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we: 
 Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 
 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. 
 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. 
 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. 
 Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 
 
 We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit.

 Revenue Recognition 
 
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606). The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new guidance requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The Company adopted ASC 606 at inception. The Company also adopted the related guidance in ASC 340-40, Contracts with Customers (ASC 340-40) on January 1, 2019 with respect to costs to obtain and costs to fulfill a contract. 
 
 Revenue recognition policy 
 
 The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, which provides a five-step model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers as follows: 
 
 Identify the contract with a customer 
 Identify the performance obligations in the contract 
 Determine the transaction price 
 Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 
 Recognize revenue when or as performance obligations are satisfied

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new accounting standard for all contracts not completed as of the adoption date using the modified retrospective method. The Company identified and implemented appropriate changes to the business policies, processes, and controls to support the adoption, recognition and disclosures under the new standard. The Company has identified the following revenue streams; initial franchise fees, operating revenues which consist of: service/royalty fees from franchises, sales of parts and equipment, revenues from sales type leases, advertising revenue, and interest income related to notes receivable and loans receivables. The Company s initial franchise fees are recognized over the life of the contract. Commissions relating to such contracts are recorded as a prepaid asset and amortized over the life of the contract. 
 
 In accordance with ASC 606, the Company disaggregates its revenue from customers with contracts by revenue streams. The Company s revenue streams are presented in the following table: 
 Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Operating Revenues: Service/royalty fees 22,296,751 19,789,537 Part and equipment sales 3,385,013 2,788,043 Advertising revenue 7,153,173 6,894,846 Initial franchise fees 4,713,057 4,558,458 Interest, service charges, and other 1,065,179 987,206 Net Revenues 38,613,173 35,018,090 
 
 Service/royalty fees derived from franchises Service Fees are recognized as revenue when revenues are earned by the franchisees. The franchisees agree to pay to the Company a weekly royalty and service fee based on a percentage of the net revenues derived by the respective franchisees from the Company s business.. Revenue from sales of parts and equipment are recognized, at the point in time which control is transferred, upon shipment. Interest income related to notes receivable and loans receivable is recorded as revenue when earned (and collection is reasonably assured) in accordance with the interest method. 
 
 Initial franchise fees are deferred and recognized over the life of the contract. Commissions paid on initial franchise fees are deferred and charged to expense upon recognition of the initial fee. 
 
 Advertising funds are presented as a gross up of revenue and related cost. Advertising funds, such as the Company s National Marketing Fund and Regional Marketing fund, promote the Company s brand nationally and in the local markets. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company records gross revenue related to Advertising funds. Which includes amounts charged by the Company to franchisees based on established contracts. Revenue related to these amounts is based on a percentage of sales of the franchisee and is recognized as earned. The sales-based royalty exception applies, and amounts are recognized as the underlying sales are done by the respective franchisees. Advertising fund revenue is deferred and is recognized as advertising expense is incurred by the Company. 
 
 Interest income mainly represents interest on notes receivable from franchisees and is recognized using the effective interest method. Service charges represent call center income, which is recognized at a point in time which the control is transferred, upon completion of calls. 
 
 Contract balances 
 
 The timing of revenue recognition may not align with the right to invoice the customer under franchisee agreements. The Company records accounts receivable when it has the unconditional right to issue an invoice and receive payment, regardless of whether revenue has been recognized. If revenue has not yet been recognized, a contract liability (deferred revenue) is recorded. Deferred revenue represents franchisee fees received that have not been earned yet. Included within the Consolidated Balance Sheets is an amount of 8,122,921 and 7,614,697 which represent deferred revenues as of the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

 Costs to obtain a contract 
 
 Broker commissions paid to brokers, as well as commissions paid to internal sales personnel, that are incremental to the acquisition of franchisee contracts are capitalized as prepaid commissions on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the period of benefit is determined to be greater than one year. The Company elected to apply the practical expedient to expense broker and sales commissions and associated costs as incurred when the expected amortization period is one year or less. The Company determines the period of benefit for broker and sales commissions paid for the acquisition of the franchisee contract by taking into consideration the term of the franchisee agreement. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over a period of approximately ten years, which commensurate with the pattern of revenue recognition. Included within the Consolidated Balance Sheets is an amount of 4,721,566 and 4,903,326 which represent prepaid commissions as of the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 Receivables from Franchisees, net 
 Receivables from franchises are recorded at net realizable value. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts for franchisees based on the aging of each franchisee's total receivables, unless, in the opinion of management, estimated net realizable value requires a further allowance. The Company monitors the business operations of new and existing franchises to ascertain that its policies continue to provide an appropriate allowance for receivables and financed franchise fees. 
 
 The Company provides franchisees with an option to finance initial franchise fees over a period of up to 96 months with interest at 12 per annum. Additionally, the Company has converted accounts receivable from certain franchisees to notes receivable. These financing arrangements entered into during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 809,198 and 1,347,400, respectively. These financing arrangements are recorded as notes receivable in receivables from franchisees in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, 2,605,437 and 3,159,942 was outstanding of which 1,206,828 and 906,133 was classified as a current asset, which represents the principal amounts due on the aggregate notes receivable, respectively. 
 
 The Company provides an estimated allowance for doubtful receivables on any notes and related interest with delinquent installments of more than six months. The Company ceases accrual of interest when the Company can no longer assert that the likelihood of collection is probable. 
 
 The Company leases equipment to its franchisees with an option to pay in full upon execution of the lease or finance over 60, 72 or 84 months depending on the type of equipment. Interest is not to exceed 1.5 per month and the Company recognizes the imputed interest over the term of the lease. The Company records these leases as a sales-type lease in accordance with ASC 842 Leases (Note 8). Leased equipment is recorded in receivables from franchisees in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, 1,801,805 was outstanding of which 394,634 was classified as a current asset. As of December 31, 2022, the Company recorded 458,813 as unearned interest of which 144,852 was classified within other current liabilities. 
 
 As of December 31, 2021, 1,605,023 was outstanding of which 357,777 was classified as a current asset. As of December 31, 2021, the Company recorded 406,475 as unearned interest of which 129,680 was classified within other current liabilities. 
 
 Unearned interest beyond one year is recorded in long-term other liabilities. 
 
 Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results, as determined at a later date, could differ from those estimates.

 Shipping Costs 
 Costs to ship products to franchisees are expensed to manufacturing expenses as incurred. The Company recorded shipping costs of 168,209 and 211,803 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 Cash 
 
 The Company maintains cash balances in various financial institutions located in the United States of America which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. 
 
 Concentration of Credit Risk 
 The Company maintains its cash balances in a financial institution that is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to 250,000 each. At times, such balances may be in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. 
 
 No one franchise or vendor exceeded 10 of the Company s sales or purchases for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 No one franchise or vendor exceeded 10 of the Company s accounts receivable or payables at December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 Inventories, net 
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Parts and materials, included as inventory, are evaluated annually by management for net realizable value and obsolescence. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the reserve for inventory was 73,824 and 64,970, respectively. 
 
 Property, Plant and Equipment, net 
 Property and equipment acquired in connection with the acquisition are stated at fair value. The previous carrying value approximates to the fair value. Other property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, which approximate 39 years for building, 5 to 7 years for furniture, fixtures and other equipment and 3 to 5 years for software and transportation equipment. Improvements to leasehold property are amortized on the straight-line method over the shorter of the asset life and remaining lease term. 
 
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
 As required by ASC 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the Company tests goodwill for impairment. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events. The Company has one reporting unit. The annual goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. First, the Company determines if the carrying value of its related reporting unit exceeds fair value, which would indicate that goodwill may be impaired. If the Company then determines that goodwill may be impaired, it compares the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying amount to determine if there is an impairment loss. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08 which amends ASC 350 for testing goodwill for impairment. The guidance provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (more than 50 that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not, the entity is then required to perform the existing two-step quantitative impairment test, otherwise no further analysis is required. An entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test. The ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test. In conjunction with management s annual review of goodwill, the Company adopted the new guidance and concluded it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. There were no impairment indicators for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

 Indefinite and Finite Lived Intangibles 
 In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other ASC 350 ), indefinite lived intangible assets are recorded at cost and are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. Impairment is recorded if the carrying amount exceeds fair value. Intangible assets which have finite useful lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their useful lives and consist of franchisee and customer relationships, and a leasehold interest. Finite lived intangible asset amortization expense was 2,334,166 and 2,308,416 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. 
 
 Long-lived Assets 
 The Company accounts for the impairment of long-lived assets in accordance with ASC 360, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets . In accordance with ASC 360, the Company evaluates long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset or group of assets. The amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. The Company did not have any long-lived assets impairment indicators during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 Debt Issuance Costs 
 
 Costs related to financing are being capitalized and amortized straight line, which approximates the effective interest method, over the term of the related debt facilities. Debt issuance costs were 198,924 and 303,307 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are presented as a reduction to long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amortization of deferred financing costs for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 104,343 and 75,568, respectively, and is recorded in interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 The asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. 
 
 The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable, based solely on its technical merits and consideration of the relevant taxing authority s widely understood administrative practices and precedents. If this threshold is met, the Company measures the tax benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in the statement of operations. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there was no impact to the consolidated financial statements relating to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. 
 
 On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted into law. Included in the CARES Act (the Act were changes in the tax law with respect to net operating loss carrybacks, bonus depreciation applicability to qualified investment property, changes to IRC Section 163j interest expense limits, AMT credit carryforward refundability, impairment of assets due to COVID-19, and other non-income tax considerations. As a result of the Act, the Company was able to defer certain payroll taxes. However, the Act had no material impact to the consolidated financial statements.

 Fair Value Measurements 
 Fair value is a market-based measurement, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques for fair value measurements include the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow) and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost), which are each based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions. The Company utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to fair value measurement techniques into three broad levels: 
 
 Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 
 
 Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability, including quoted prices for similar asset or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for similar or identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and mode-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. 
 
 Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions. 
 
 The Company s material financial instruments at December 31, 2022 and 2021, for which disclosure of estimated value is required by certain accounting standards, consisted primarily of receivables from franchisees, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and debt. The carrying value of the term loan approximates fair value due to the variable interest rate associated with this financial instrument. 
 
 Business Acquisitions 
 The Company accounts for business combinations in accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations. ASC 805 requires business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and includes specific criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill. Results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the financial statements of the acquiring company from the date of acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the acquired company are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisitions. 
 
 Leases 
 
 The company engages in leasing activity as both a lessee and a lessor. 
 
 The Company adopted ASC 842, effective January 1, 2022, using the modified retrospective method of adoption. The Company elected the package of practical expedients, which, among other items, permits the Company not to reassess under the new standard its prior conclusions about lease identification and initial direct costs. The Company also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that quality. Under this election, the Company does not recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for leases with a term of 12 months or less. The Company also elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for all leases. The Company did not elect the use-of hindsight practical expedient. As a result of the Company adopting ASC 842, the Company recognized right-of-use assets (ROUs) of 470,960 and lease obligations of 264,684 and 206,276, classified into current and non-current portion of liabilities, respectively. 
 
 See Note 11 Leases for additional information.

 Lessee 
 
 The company enters into operating leases and determines whether an arrangement is a lease at inception of the arrangement. The company accounts for a lease when it has the right to control the leased asset for a period of time while obtaining substantially all of the assets economic benefits. Leases are classified as operating or finance leases at the lease commencement date. A lease is classified as a finance lease if any one of the following criteria are met: 
 
 1. The leases transfers ownership of the asset at the end of the lease term. 
 2. The lease contains an option to purchase the asset that is reasonably certain to be exercised. 
 3. The lease term is for a major part of the remaining useful life of the asset, or 
 4. The present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset. 
 
 A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not meet any one of these criteria. The company currently only has operating leases as a lessee. The operating leases consist primarily of facility space, vehicles, and office equipment. 
 
 Lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term, excluding lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred, if any. Lease liabilities represent the company s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease and ROU assets represent the Company s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. The discount rate used to determine the present value of the lease payments is the Company s incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease inception, as generally an implicit rate in the lease is not readily determinable. The company s leases do not include residual value guarantees or covenants. 
 
 Lease expense for operating leases with original terms of less than 12 months is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
 
 When determining the lease term at inception, options to extend or renew leases are included in the measurement and recognition of ROU asset and liability when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The Company considers various economic factors when making the determination, including, but not limited to, the significance of leasehold improvements incurred in the facility space, the difficulty in replacing the lease, underlying contractual obligations, or specific characteristics unique to a particular lease. Subsequent to entering a lease, if it becomes reasonably certain that the company will exercise an option that was not included in the lease term, the Company accounts for the change in circumstances as a lease modification, which results in the remeasurement of the ROU asset and liability as of the modification date. The Company continually evaluates whether facts or circumstances indicate it is reasonably certain that it will exercise an option. 
 
 Lessor 
 
 The Company classifies leases as sales-type based on the results of the classification tests in accordance with ASC 842 and has elected, as an accounting policy to present all funds collected from lessees for sales and other similar taxes net of the related sales tax expense for all lessor leases. The Company also excludes executory costs from lease accounting if the lessee s payments of those costs are made to a third party (e.g. taxing authority or insurer). 
 
 Advertising Expenses 
 The Company expenses its advertising costs the first time the advertising takes place. All advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Total advertising expense recorded in selling, general, and administrative expense within the Consolidated Statements of Operations was 754,707 and 826,125 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 The Company incurs regional advertising costs, which are repaid weekly by franchisees based upon their cash receipts. The balances are reported as prepaid or accrued expenses at year-end.

 10. Leases 
 
 The Company currently has operating leases for its facility space, vehicles, and postage equipment. These leases are used for the operations of the business and are mostly located in the state of New Jersey. The initial lease term and whether the Company has the option to renew are outlined below: 
 
 Facility space 10 years with the option to renew 
 Vehicles 2 to 10 years with no option to renew 
 Postage equipment 5 years with no option to renew

 Credit Agreements 
 On February 7, 2018, in conjunction with the acquisition by CNL Strategic Capital, LLC CNLSC ), the Company entered into an amendment to their Credit Agreement dated December 12, 2014. The amendment permitted the repayment of all of the outstanding principal amount of Subordinated Debt as of the date of the agreement, issuances up to 18,000,000 of subordinated second lien indebtedness, increase in the Term Loan by 6,000,000 and extended the maturity date to February 7, 2023. The amendment also contains revisions to the restrictive covenants inclusive of senior debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, fixed charge ratio, and excess cash flow. The Revolving Loan Commitment remained unchanged. The Revolving Loan Commitment was payable upon maturity on December 11, 2019. This was later amended in March 2019 to extend the maturity date to February 7, 2023 and clarify certain definitions in the prior amendment. 
 
 On August 11, 2021, the Company entered into a new amendment to their Credit Agreement dated December 12, 2014. The amendment increased the Term Loan by 10,700,000 and extended the maturity date for the Term Loan as well as the Revolving Loan Commitment to February 7, 2025. The amendment was treated as a debt modification. The amendment also contained revisions to the restrictive covenants inclusive of senior debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio and excess cash flow.

 Litigation 
 
 The Company is party to various legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of business. In the present opinion of management, none of these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, are likely to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations or cash flows of the Company. However, management cannot provide assurance that any adverse outcome would not be material to the Company s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations or cash flows.

 15. Income Taxes 
 
 Deferred income taxes result from timing differences in the recognition of income and expenses for income tax and financial reporting purposes. 
 
 Net deferred tax assets and liabilities are summarized as follows: 
 December 31, 2022 2021 Employee compensation 427,654 348,096 Accounts receivable 136,772 126,675 Inventory 18,857 16,158 Partnership interest 944,834 666,907 Deferred revenue 767,732 682,942 Interest limitation 233,624 Foreign net operating loss 27,336 Valuation allowance (108,928) Deferred tax assets 2,447,881 1,840,778 Property and equipment (345,473) (327,611) Intangible assets (10,689,426) (10,910,230) Other (8,477) (26,971) Deferred tax liabilities 
 (11,043,376) (11,264,812) Net deferred income tax liabilities (8,595,495) (9,424,034) 
 
 In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryback and carryforward periods), projected future taxable income, and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on this analysis, the Company has determined that a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets related to Sparkle Squad, LLC were appropriate due to lack of predictable income. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company maintained a valuation allowance in the amount of 108,928 and 0 respectively.

 Share Options 
 Stock Options are issued by LD Parent pursuant to its 2018 Stock Incentive Plan the Plan ). The related stock-based compensation is pushed down to its subsidiary and recorded by the Company. The Company follows ASC 718, Share-Based Payment , for recording stock-based compensation. The fair value of each time-based and performance-based option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. These options, along with performance-based options, will be expensed when such events are deemed probable. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of an appropriate industry sector index and other factors. The expected term of options with fixed exercise prices is derived by using the midpoint between vesting and expiration as the expected term of the option grant which is permitted under the guidance. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. No stock options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Upon termination of the Management Agreement, the Company shall be required to pay to the terminated Manager all amounts then accrued and owing. The method of payment to the terminated Manager must be fair and protect the solvency and liquidity of the Company.

When the termination is involuntary, the method of payment will be presumed to be fair if it provides for an interest bearing promissory note maturing in not less than five years with equal installments each year.
