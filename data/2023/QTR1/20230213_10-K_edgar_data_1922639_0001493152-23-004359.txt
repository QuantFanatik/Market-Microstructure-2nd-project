PETROLEUM CORPORATION 

 FORM
10-K 

As
used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, references to Permex, the Company, we, 
 us and our are to Permex Petroleum Corporation, a corporation organized under the laws of British
Columbia, Canada, individually, or as the context requires, collectively with its subsidiaries. Certain operational terms used in
this Annual Report are defined in the Glossary of Terms section below. All references to U.S. Dollars, 
 USD or are to the legal currency of the United States, and all references to CAD and
 C are to the legal currency of Canada. All references to M are in thousands of dollars. 

GLOSSARY
OF TERMS 

Unless
otherwise indicated in this Annual Report, natural gas volumes are stated at the legal pressure base of the state or geographic area
in which the reserves are located at 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Crude oil and natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of six
Mcf of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids. 

The
following definitions shall apply to the technical terms used in this Annual Report. 

Terms
used to describe quantities of crude oil and natural gas: 

Bbl . 
One stock tank barrel, of 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume, used herein in reference to crude oil, condensate or NGLs. 

Boe . 
A barrel of oil equivalent and is a standard convention used to express crude oil, NGL and natural gas volumes on a comparable crude
oil equivalent basis. Gas equivalents are determined under the relative energy content method by using the ratio of 6.0 Mcf of natural
gas to 1.0 Bbl of crude oil or NGL. 

MBbl . 
One thousand barrels of crude oil, condensate or NGLs. 

MBoe 
One thousand barrels of oil equivalent. 

Mcf . 
One thousand cubic feet of natural gas. 

MMCF. 
one million cubic feet. 

NGLs . 
Natural gas liquids. Hydrocarbons found in natural gas that may be extracted as liquefied petroleum gas and natural gasoline. 

Terms
used to describe our interests in wells and acreage: 

Basin . 
A large natural depression on the earth s surface in which sediments generally brought by water accumulate. 

Completion. 
The process of treating a drilled well followed by the installation of permanent equipment for the production of crude oil, NGLs, and/or
natural gas. 

Developed
acreage. Acreage consisting of leased acres spaced or assignable to productive wells. Acreage included in spacing units of
infill wells is classified as developed acreage at the time production commences from the initial well in the spacing unit. As such,
the addition of an infill well does not have any impact on a company s amount of developed acreage. 

Development
well. A well drilled within the proved area of a crude oil, NGL, or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic
horizon (rock layer or formation) known to be productive for the purpose of extracting proved crude oil, NGL, or natural gas reserves. 

Differential. 
The difference between a benchmark price of crude oil and natural gas, such as the NYMEX crude oil spot price, and the wellhead price
received. 

Dry
hole . A well found to be incapable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that proceeds from the sale of
such production exceed production expenses and taxes. 

Field . 
An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on, or related to, the same individual geological structural
feature or stratigraphic condition. The field name refers to the surface area, although it may refer to both the surface and the underground
productive formations. 

3 

Formation . 
A layer of rock which has distinct characteristics that differs from nearby rock. 

Gross
acres or Gross wells. The total acres or wells, as the case may be, in which a working interest is owned. 

Held
by operations. A provision in an oil and gas lease that extends the stated term of the lease as long as drilling operations
are ongoing on the property. 

Held
by production or HBP A provision in an oil and gas lease that extends the stated term of the lease as
long as the property produces a minimum quantity of crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas. 

Hydraulic
fracturing . The technique of improving a well s production by pumping a mixture of fluids into the formation and rupturing
the rock, creating an artificial channel. As part of this technique, sand or other material may also be injected into the formation to
keep the channel open, so that fluids or natural gases may more easily flow through the formation. 

Infill
well. A subsequent well drilled in an established spacing unit of an already established productive well in the spacing unit.
Acreage on which infill wells are drilled is considered developed commencing with the initial productive well established in the spacing
unit. As such, the addition of an infill well does not have any impact on a company s amount of developed acreage. 

Net
acres. The percentage ownership of gross acres. Net acres are deemed to exist when the sum of fractional ownership working
interests in gross acres equals one (e.g., a 10 working interest in a lease covering 640 gross acres is equivalent to 64 net acres). 

NYMEX . 
The New York Mercantile Exchange. 

Productive
well . A well that is found to be capable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that proceeds from the sale
of the production exceed production expenses and taxes. 

Recompletion . 
The process of treating a drilled well followed by the installation of permanent equipment for the production of crude oil, NGLs or natural
gas or, in the case of a dry hole, the reporting of abandonment to the appropriate agency. 

Reservoir . 
A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible crude oil, NGLs and/or natural gas that
is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is separate from other reservoirs. 

Spacing . 
The distance between wells producing from the same reservoir. Spacing is often expressed in terms of acres, e.g., 40-acre spacing, and
is often established by regulatory agencies. 

Undeveloped
acreage . Leased acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic
quantities of crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas, regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. Undeveloped acreage includes
net acres held by operations until a productive well is established in the spacing unit. 

Unit . 
The joining of all or substantially all interests in a reservoir or field, rather than a single tract, to provide for development and
operation without regard to separate property interests. Also, the area covered by a unitization agreement. 

Wellbore . 
The hole drilled by the bit that is equipped for natural gas production on a completed well. Also called well or borehole. 

Working
interest . The right granted to the lessee of a property to explore for and to produce and own crude oil, NGLs, natural gas
or other minerals. The working interest owners bear the exploration, development, and operating costs on either a cash, penalty, or carried
basis. 

Workover. 
 Operations on a producing well to restore or increase production. 

Terms
used to assign a present value to or to classify our reserves: 

Possible
reserves. The additional reserves which analysis of geoscience and engineering data suggest are less likely to be recoverable
than probable reserves. 

Pre-tax
PV-10 or PV-10. The estimated future net revenue, discounted at a rate of 10 per annum, before income taxes and with no
price or cost escalation or de-escalation in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the SEC. 

Probable
reserves. The additional reserves which analysis of geoscience and engineering data indicate are less likely to be recovered
than proved reserves but which together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. 

4 

Proved
reserves . The quantities of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, which, by analysis of geosciences and engineering data, can be
estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible, from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing
economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations, prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate
expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are
used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that
it will commence the project within a reasonable time. 

Proved
undeveloped reserves or PUDs . Proved Reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled
acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Reserves on undrilled acreage are
limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence
using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. Undrilled locations
can be classified as having proved undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled
to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time. Estimates for proved undeveloped reserves are
not attributed to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless
such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or by other evidence using
reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty. 

SEC
Pricing means pricing calculated using oil and natural gas price parameters established by current guidelines of the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and accounting rules based on the unweighted arithmetic average of
oil and natural gas prices as of the first day of each of the 12 months ended on the given date. 

MARKET
AND INDUSTRY INFORMATION 

This
Annual Report contains market data and industry statistics and forecasts that are based on independent industry publications and other
publicly available information. Although we believe that these sources are reliable, we do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness
of this information and we have not independently verified this information. Although we are not aware of any misstatements regarding
the market and industry data presented in this Annual Report, these estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change
based on various factors, including those discussed under the heading Risk Factors . Accordingly, investors should not place
undue reliance on this information. 

FORWARD
LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K, including any information incorporated by reference, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning
of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, referred to as the Securities Act , and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, referred to as the Exchange Act . All statements, other than statements of historical
fact included in this Annual Report, regarding our strategy, future operations, financial position, estimated revenue and losses, projected
costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management are forward-looking statements. When used in this Annual Report, the words could, 
 believe, anticipate, intend, estimate, expect, project 
and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such
identifying words. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions about future events and are
based on currently available information as to the outcome and timing of future events. When considering forward-looking statements,
you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under Risk Factors. These forward-looking
statements are based on management s current belief, based on currently available information, as to the outcome and timing of
future events. 

Forward-looking
statements may include statements about: 

our
 business strategy; 

our
 reserves; 

our
 financial strategy, liquidity and capital requirements; 

our
 realized or expected natural gas prices; 

our
 timing and amount of future production of natural gas; 

our
 future drilling plans and cost estimates; 

our
 competition and government regulations; 

5 

our
 ability to make acquisitions; 

the
 impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on our business and financial condition; 

general
 economic conditions; 

our
 future operating results; 

our
 expectations regarding having our securities listed on NYSE American; and 

our
 future plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. 

We
caution you that these forward-looking statements are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult
to predict and many of which are beyond our control. These risks include, but are not limited to, commodity price volatility, lack of
availability of drilling and production equipment and services, environmental risks, drilling and other operating risks, regulatory changes,
the uncertainty inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production, cash flow and access
to capital, the timing of development expenditures, and the other risks described under Risk Factors. 

Reserve
engineering is a method of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy
of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made
by reserve engineers. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of previous estimates.
If significant, such revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates
may differ significantly from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered. 

Should
one or more of the risks or uncertainties described in this Annual Report occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our
actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. 

All
forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this Annual Report are expressly qualified in their entirety by
this cautionary statement. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, we disclaim any duty to update any forward-looking statements,
all of which are expressly qualified by the statements in this section, to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Annual
Report. 

PART
I 

ITEM
1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

We
are an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas properties
on private, state and federal land in the United States, primarily in the Permian Basin region of West Texas and Southeast New Mexico
which includes the Midland Central Basin and Delaware Basin. We focus on acquiring producing assets at a discount to market,
increasing production and cash-flow through recompletion and re-entries, secondary recovery and lower risk infill drilling and development.
Currently, we own and operate various oil and gas properties as well as royalty interests in 73 wells and five permitted wells across
3,800 acres within the Permian Basin. Overall, we own and operate more than 78 oil and gas wells, have more than 11,700 net acres of
production oil and gas assets, 62 shut-in opportunities, 17 salt water disposal wells and two water supply wells allowing for waterflood
secondary recovery. 

Corporate
History 

We
were incorporated on April 24, 2017 under the laws of British Columbia, Canada. At September 30, 2022, we have one wholly-owned
subsidiary, Permex Petroleum US Corporation Permex U.S. ), a corporation incorporated under the laws of New Mexico. We own and operate oil and gas properties in Texas (Breedlove B Property, Pittcock North
Property, Pittcock South Property and Mary Bullard Property), and Permex U.S. owns and operates oil and gas properties in New Mexico
(Henshaw Property and the Oxy Yates Property).

Oil
and Gas Properties 

The
Company hired MKM Engineering, who prepared the Appraisal Reports. MKM Engineering is independent with respect to Permex as provided in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated
by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. MKM Engineering s estimates of the Company s proved and probable reserves in each
of the Appraisal Reports were prepared according to generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles, and each of the
Appraisal Reports conform to SEC Pricing. The Appraisal Reports are each filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report. 

The
Appraisal Reports were each specifically prepared by Michele Mudrone, an employee of MKM Engineering, a registered Professional Engineer
in the State of Texas, and a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Ms. Mudrone graduated from the Colorado School of Mines with
a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering in 1976 and has been employed in the petroleum industry and directly involved in
reservoir engineering, petrophysical analysis, reservoir simulation and property evaluation since that time. Ms. Mudrone certified in
each Appraisal Report that she did not receive, nor expects to receive, any direct or indirect interest in the holdings discussed in
the report or in the securities of the Company. Because the Company s current size, the Company does not have any technical person
at the Company responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserve estimates presented herein (or have any internal control policies
pertaining to estimates of oil and gas reserves), and consequently, the Company relies exclusively on the Appraisal Reports in the preparation
of the reserve estimates present in this Annual Report. 

Since
all of the Company s reserves are from conventional reservoirs, MKM Engineering assumed for the purposes of its appraisal reports
that the technology to be used to develop the Company s reserves would include horizontally drilled wells, fracturing, and acidizing. 

The
following tables show a summary of our reserves as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 which have been derived from the Appraisal
Reports and conform to SEC Pricing.

Probable
reserves are unproven reserves that geologic and engineering analyses suggest are more likely than not to be recoverable. They are not
comparable to proved reserves and estimates of oil, condensate, and gas reserves and future net revenue should be regarded only as estimates
that may change as further production history and additional information become available. Such reserve and revenue estimates are based
on the information currently available, the interpretation of which is subject to uncertainties inherent in applying judgmental factors. 

Conversion
of Undeveloped Acreage 

The
Company s process for converting undeveloped acreage to developed acreage is tied to whether there is any drilling being conducted
on the acreage in question. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the Company made investment in and made progress towards,
converting proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. The Company began drilling on undeveloped acreage and made investments
in undeveloped reserves from September 30, 2022 to the date hereof. 

An
aggregate of 5,083 MBO and 2,136 MMCF, of the Company s proved undeveloped reserves as of September 30, 2022, are part of a development
plan that has been adopted by management that calls for these undeveloped reserves to be drilled within the next five years, thus resulting
in the conversion of such proved undeveloped reserves to developed status within five years of initial disclosure at September 30, 2022. 

Proved
Undeveloped Reserves Additions 

From
September 30, 2021 to September 30, 2022, the Company had no proved undeveloped reserve additions. The specific changes to the Company s
proved undeveloped reserves from September 30, 2021 to September 30, 2022 were as follows:

 Natural
 gas volumes have been converted to Boe based on energy content of six Mcf of gas to one Bbl of oil. Barrels of oil equivalence does
 not necessarily result in price equivalence. The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is currently substantially
 lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been similarly lower for a number of years. For example, in the year ended September
 30, 2022, the average prices of WTI (Cushing) oil and NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas were 91.71 per Bbl and 6.126 per Mcf, respectively,
 resulting in an oil-to-gas ratio of just under 14 to 1.

Financing
of Proved and Probable Undeveloped Reserves 

The
Company currently estimates that the total cost to develop the Company s proved undeveloped reserves of 5,083.2 MBbl of oil and
2,136.4 Mcf of natural gas as of September 30, 2022 is 68,818,530. The Company expects to finance these capital costs through a combination
of current cash on hand, debt financing through a line of credit or similar debt instrument, one or more offerings of debt or equity,
and from cash generated from estimated revenues from sales of oil and natural gas produced at the Company s wells. 

The
Company currently estimates that the total cost to develop the Company s probable undeveloped reserves of 7,334.3 MBbl of oil and
10,307.1 Mcf of natural gas as of September 30, 2022 is 107,884,900. The Company expects to finance these capital costs through a combination
of joint ventures, farm-in agreements, direct participation programs, one or more offerings of equity, a debt offering or entering into
a line of credit, and from cash generated from estimated revenues from sales of oil and natural gas produced at the Company s wells. 

Drilling
Activities 

The
Company drilled one well during the last three fiscal years. As at September 30, 2022, the Company held leases for 78 gross wells and
had leases and royalty interests in an aggregate of 102 gross productive wells (including 73 wells that we acquired royalty interests
in 2021). The Company s gross developed acreage totaled 5,177 and net developed acreage totaled 3,942 with the following

Properties 

Breedlove
 B Clearfork Leases 

In
September 2021, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Permex U.S., acquired a 100 Working Interest and an 81.75 
Net Revenue Interest in the Breedlove B Clearfork leases located in Martin County, Texas. We issued 416,666 common shares
and 208,333 share purchase warrants as consideration for this acquisition. The Breedlove B Clearfork properties situated
in Martin County, Texas are over 12 contiguous sections for a total of 7,870.23 gross and 7,741.67 net acres, of which 98 is held by
production in the core of the Permian Basin. It is bounded on the north by Dawson County, on the east by Howard County, on the south
by Glasscock and Midland Counties, and on the west by Andrews County. There is a total of 25 vertical wells of which 12 are producers,
4 are saltwater disposal wells and 9 that are shut-in opportunities. In January 2022, we began the pilot re-entry on the Carter Clearfork
well #5, which is one of 67 shut-in wells that we currently own. The re-entry involved targeting the Clearfork formation at a depth of
7,200 feet. Due to the high water concentrating in the fluid entry, management will be installing appropriate flow-lines from this well
to the injections wells on the property prior to putting the well back on pump. By doing so management is avoiding unnecessary operating
expenses from water disposal in third party disposal facilities. 

10 

Pittcock
Leases 

The
Pittcock Leases are situated in Stonewall County. Stonewall County is in Northwest Texas, in the central part of the North Central Plains
and consists of the Pittcock North property, the Pittcock South property and the Windy Jones Property. It is bounded on the north by
King County, on the east by Haskell County, on the south by Fisher and Jones Counties, and on the west by Kent County. The Pittcock North
property covers 320 acres held by production. There is currently one producing well, ten shut-in wells, two saltwater disposal wells,
and a water supply well. We hold a 100 working interest in the Pittcock North Property and an 81.25 net revenue interest. The Pittcock
South property covers 498 acres in four tracts. There are currently 19 shut-in wells and two saltwater disposal wells. We hold a 100 
working interest in the lease and a 71.90 net revenue interest. The Windy Jones Property consists of 40 acres and includes two injection
wells and two suspended oil wells. The sole purpose of the Windy Jones property is to provide waterflood to the offset wells being the
Pittcock wells located east boundary of the Windy Jones Property. We hold a 100 working interest in the Windy Jones Property and a 78.9 
net revenue interest. 

Mary
Bullard Property 

We
acquired the Mary Bullard Property in August 2017 for a cash consideration of approximately 50,000. The Mary Bullard Property is located
in Stonewall County, about 5 miles south west of Aspermont, Texas. It is bounded on the north by King County, on the east by
Haskell County, on the south by Fisher and Jones Counties, and on the west by Kent County. The asset is situated on the Eastern Shelf
of the Midland Basin in the central part of the North Central Plains. The Mary Bullard Property covers 241 acres held by production and
is productive in the Clearfork formation at a depth of approximately 3,200 feet. There is currently one producing well, four shut-in
wells, and two water injection wells. We hold a 100 working interest in the Mary Bullard Property and a 78.625 net revenue interest. 

New
Mexico Properties 

In
December 2017, Permex U.S., our wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired the West Henshaw Property and the Oxy Yates Property
for 170,000 from Permex Petroleum Company LLC PPC ). An additional 95,000 was transferred by us to PPC to purchase reclamation
bonds in connection with the future operation of the properties. 

West
Henshaw Property 

The
West Henshaw Property is located in Eddy County, New Mexico, 12 miles northeast of Loco Hills in the Delaware Basin. Eddy County is in
Southeast New Mexico. It is bounded by Chaves County to the north, Otero County to the east, Loving County, Texas to the south, and Lea
County to the west. The West Henshaw Property covers 1,880 acres held by production. There are two producing wells, seven shut-in wells
and four saltwater disposal wells. We hold a 100 working interest in the West Henshaw Property and a 72 net revenue interest. 

In
January 2022, we began the pilot re-entry on the West Henshaw well #15-3, one out of the 67 shut-in wells we currently owns. The re-entry
and re-stimulation involved the West Henshaw property targeting the Grayburg formation at a depth of 2,850 feet. The recompletion was
successful and came online at an initial rate of 30 bopd and has stabilized at 15 bopd. Management believes the production rates from
this mature, long-life well to continue with less than 10 decline year over year. 

In
April 2022, we began the re-entry on the West Henshaw well #6-10. The re-entry and re-stimulation involved the West Henshaw property
targeting the Grayburg formation at a depth of 2,850 feet. The recompletion was successful and came online at an initial rate of 15 bopd
and has stabilized at 10 bopd. Management believes the production rates from this mature, long-life well to continue with less than 10 
decline year over year. 

The
remaining 67 shut-in wells that we plan to re-enter have potential to yield similar results increasing our total daily production solely
by re-entering shut-in wells. 

Oxy
Yates Property 

The
Oxy Yates Property is located in Eddy County, approximately eight miles north of Carlsbad, New Mexico in the Delaware Basin. It is bounded
by Chaves County to the north, Otero County to the east, Loving County, Texas to the south, and Lea County to the west. The Oxy Yates
Property covers 680 acres held by production. There is one producing well and nine shut-in wells. The Yates formation is located at an
average depth of 1,200 feet and overlies the Seven River formation and underlies the Tansill formation. We hold a 100 working interest
in the Oxy Yates Property and a 77 net revenue interest. 

11 

Royalty
Interest Properties 

During
the year ended September 30, 2021, we acquired royalty interests in 73 producing oil and gas wells located in Texas and New Mexico for
 179,095. There are no changes to the royalty interests held by the Company in fiscal 2022. 

Recent
Developments 

On
November 2, 2022, we effected a 1-for-60 reverse split of our outstanding Common shares. No fractional shares were issued in
connection with the reverse stock split and all such fractional interests were rounded up to the nearest whole number of Common
shares. The conversion and/or exercise prices of our issued and outstanding convertible securities, including shares issuable upon
exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants, conversion of our outstanding convertible notes and conversions of preferred
stock have been adjusted accordingly. All information presented in this Annual Report has been retrospectively restated to give
effect to our 1-for-60 reverse split of our outstanding Common shares, and unless otherwise indicated, all such amounts and
corresponding conversion price and/or exercise price data set forth in this Annual Report has been adjusted to give effect to such
reverse stock split. 

In
November 2022, we announced that drilling commenced on our Eoff PPC#3 well on our Breedlove Oilfield, that the target depth of 8,100
ft (2468 meters) was achieved and that the casing was run to total depth. The electric wireline logging sequence of the wellbore was
also completed, and we believed the results to be positive as all indications from the drilling show to be favorable as multiple zones
have been found which allows us to proceed with the next steps of perforation and completion. 

Business
Strategy 

The
principal elements of our business strategy include the following: 

Grow
 production and reserves in a capital efficient manner using internally generated levered free cash flow. We intend to allocate capital
 in a disciplined manner to projects that we anticipate will produce predictable and attractive rates of return. We plan to direct
 capital to our oil-rich and low-risk development opportunities while focusing on driving cost efficiencies across our asset base
 with the primary objective of internally funding our capital budget and growth plan. We may also use our capital flexibility to pursue
 value-enhancing, bolt-on acquisitions to opportunistically improve our positions in existing basins. 

12 

Maximize
 ultimate hydrocarbon recovery from our assets by optimizing drilling, completion and production techniques and investigating deeper
 reservoirs and areas beyond our known productive areas. While we intend to utilize proven techniques and technologies, we will also
 continuously seek efficiencies in our drilling, completion and production techniques in order to optimize ultimate resource recoveries,
 rates of return and cash flows. We will explore innovative EOR techniques to unlock additional value and have allocated capital towards
 next generation technologies. For example, we have already completed extensive waterflood EOR studies in Pittcock North and Pittcock
 South. Through these studies, we will seek to expand our development beyond our known productive areas in order to add probable and
 possible reserves to our inventory at attractive all-in costs. 

Pursue
 operational excellence with a sense of urgency. We plan to deliver low cost, consistent, timely and efficient execution of our drilling
 campaigns, work programs and operations. We intend to execute our operations in a safe and environmentally responsible manner, focus
 on reducing our emissions, apply advanced technologies, and continuously seek ways to reduce our operating cash costs on a per barrel
 basis. 

Pursue
 strategic acquisitions that maintain or reduce our break-even costs. We intend to actively pursue accretive acquisitions, mergers
 and dispositions that are intended to improve our margins, returns, and break-even costs of our investment portfolio. Financial strategies
 associated with these efforts will focus on delivering competitive adjusted per share returns. 

Industry
Operating Environment 

The
oil and natural gas industry is a global market impacted by many factors, such as government regulations, particularly in the areas of
taxation, energy, climate change and the environment, political and social developments in the Middle East, demand in Asian and European
markets, and the extent to which members of The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil exporting nations manage
oil supply through export quotas. Natural gas prices are generally determined by North American supply and demand and are also affected
by imports and exports of liquefied natural gas. Weather also has a significant impact on demand for natural gas since it is a primary
heating source, and a major fuel for electric generation to power air conditioning. 

Oil
and natural gas prices have been, and we expect may continue to be, volatile. Lower oil and gas prices not only decrease our revenues,
but an extended decline in oil or gas prices may affect planned capital expenditures and the oil and natural gas reserves that we can
economically produce. While lower commodity prices may reduce our future net cash flow from operations, we expect to have sufficient
liquidity to continue development of our oil and gas properties. 

Development 

We
believe that there is significant value to be created by drilling the identified undeveloped opportunities on our properties in conjunction
with the stimulation and rework of our shut-in wells. While our near-term plans are focused towards drilling wells on our existing acreage
to develop the potential contained therein, our long-term plans also include continuing to evaluate acquisition and leasing opportunities
that can earn attractive rates of return on capital employed. 

Competition 

The
oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive and we compete with numerous other oil and natural gas exploration and production
companies, many of which have substantially larger technical teams and greater financial and operational resources than we do and may
be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties. Many of these companies not only engage
in the acquisition, exploration, development, and production of oil and gas reserves, but also have gathering, processing or refining
operations, market refined products, provide, dispose of and transport fresh and produced water, own drilling rigs or production equipment,
or generate electricity, all of which, individually or in the aggregate, could provide such companies with a competitive advantage. We
also compete with other oil and gas companies in securing drilling rigs and other equipment and services necessary for the drilling,
completion, and maintenance of wells, as well as for the gathering, transporting, and processing of oil, gas, natural gas liquids, and
water. Consequently, we may face shortages, delays, or increased costs in securing these services from time to time. The oil and gas
industry also faces competition from alternative fuel sources, including renewable energy sources such as solar and wind-generated energy,
and other fossil fuels such as coal. Competitive conditions may also be affected by future energy, environmental, climate-related, financial,
or other policies, legislation, and regulations. Our larger or integrated competitors may be better able to absorb the burden of existing,
and any changes to federal, state, and local laws and regulations than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position.
Our ability to discover reserves and acquire additional properties in the future is dependent upon our ability and resources to evaluate
and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment. 

Marketing
and Customers 

The
market for oil and natural gas that will be produced from our properties depends on many factors, including the extent of domestic production
and imports of oil and natural gas, the proximity and availability of capacity and rates and terms of service of pipelines and other
transportation and storage facilities, demand for oil and natural gas, the marketing of competitive fuels and the effects of state and
federal regulation. The oil and natural gas industry also competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements
of industrial, commercial and individual consumers. 

13 

Our
oil production is being sold to Energy Transfer Partners and HollyFrontier at prices tied to Argus. Our natural gas production is being
sold to DCP Operating Company LP under Henry Hub gas spot prices. 

For the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, we had three and one significant
purchaser that accounted for approximately 83 and 90 , respectively, of our total oil, and natural gas revenues. If we lost one or more
of these significant purchasers and were unable to sell our production to other purchasers on terms we consider acceptable, it could materially
and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

Title
to Properties 

Our
oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests, liens under indebtedness, liens incident to operating
agreements, liens for current taxes and other burdens, including other mineral encumbrances and restrictions. We do not believe that
any of these burdens materially interfere with the use of our properties or the operation of our business. We believe that we have satisfactory
title to or rights in our producing properties. As is customary in the oil and gas industry, minimal investigation of title is made at
the time of acquisition of undeveloped properties. In most cases, we investigate title only when we acquire producing properties or before
commencement of drilling operations. 

Seasonality 

Winter
weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit or temporarily halt the drilling and producing activities of our operating partners
and other oil and natural gas operations. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay or temporarily halt
the operations of our operating partners and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Such seasonal anomalies can also pose
challenges for meeting well drilling objectives and may increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the spring
and summer months, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay or temporarily halt our operating partners operations. 

The
demand and price for gas frequently increases during winter months and decreases during summer months. To lessen the impact of seasonal
gas demand and price fluctuations, pipelines, utilities, local distribution companies, and industrial users regularly utilize gas storage
facilities and forward purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer. However, increased summertime demand
for electricity can divert gas that is traditionally placed into storage which, in turn, may increase the typical winter seasonal price.
Seasonal anomalies, such as mild winters, or other unexpected impacts, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, sometimes lessen or exacerbate
these fluctuations. 

Principal
Agreements Affecting Our Ordinary Business 

We
generally do not own physical real estate, but, instead, our acreage is primarily comprised of leasehold interests subject to the terms
and provisions of lease agreements that provide us the right to participate in drilling and maintenance of wells in specific geographic
areas. Lease arrangements that comprise our acreage positions are generally established using industry-standard terms that have been
established and used in the oil and natural gas industry for many years. Many of our leases are or were acquired from other parties that
obtained the original leasehold interest prior to our acquisition of the leasehold interest. 

In
general, our lease agreements stipulate three-to-five year terms. Bonuses and royalty rates are negotiated on a case-by-case basis consistent
with industry standard pricing. Once a well is drilled and production established, the leased acreage in the applicable spacing unit
is considered developed acreage and is held by production. Other locations within the drilling unit created for a well may also be drilled
at any time with no time limit as long as the lease is held by production. Given the current pace of drilling in the areas of our operations,
we do not believe lease expiration issues will materially affect our acreage position. 

Governmental
Regulation and Environmental Matters 

Our
operations are subject to various rules, regulations and limitations impacting the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry
as whole. 

14 

Regulation
of Oil and Natural Gas Production 

Our
oil and natural gas exploration, production and related operations are subject to extensive rules and regulations promulgated by federal,
state, tribal and local authorities and agencies. For example, certain states require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds
and reports concerning operations and impose other requirements relating to the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. Texas
and New Mexico also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling
of oil and natural gas properties, and several states regulate the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface
use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the sourcing and disposal of water used in the process of drilling, completion
and abandonment, the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells, and the regulation of spacing, plugging and abandonment
of such wells. Moreover, the current U.S. federal Administration has indicated that it expects to impose additional federal regulations
limiting access to and production from federal lands. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that
registrant can produce from wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which drilling can occur. Moreover, many states
impose a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within their
jurisdictions, and the current federal Administration has proposed increasing royalties payable for production on Federal land. Failure
to comply with any such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry
may increase our cost of doing business and may affect our profitability. Because such rules and regulations are frequently amended or
reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws. Significant expenditures may be required
to comply with governmental laws and regulations and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Additionally, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may
be discovered. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance. Additional proposals and proceedings that
affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC ),
Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration PHMSA ), and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such
proposals may become effective. 

Regulation
of Transportation of Oil 

Sales
of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress
could reenact price controls in the future. Our sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation.
The transportation of oil by common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate and access regulation. The FERC regulates interstate oil
pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act. Interstate oil pipeline rates may be cost-based, although settlement
rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market-based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances. Effective January 1,
1995, the FERC implemented regulations establishing an indexing system (based on inflation) for transportation rates for oil pipelines
that allows a pipeline to increase its rates annually up to a prescribed ceiling, without making a cost of service filing. Every five
years, the FERC reviews the appropriateness of the index level in relation to changes in industry costs. On January 20, 2022, the FERC
established a new price index for the five-year period which commenced on July 1, 2021. Oil pipelines may also seek market-based rates. 

Intrastate
oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation,
and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates varies from state to state. Insofar as effective
interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation
rates will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors in the same state who are
similarly situated. 

Further,
interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard,
common carriers must offer service to all similarly situated shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates.
When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is generally governed by pro-rationing provisions set forth in the pipelines 
published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the
same extent as to our similarly situated competitors. 

Regulation
of Transportation and Sales of Natural Gas 

Historically, the
transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act of
1938 NGA ), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 NGPA and regulations issued under those statutes. In
the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. While sales by producers of natural
gas can currently be made at market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. 

Onshore
gathering services, which occur upstream of FERC jurisdictional transmission services, are regulated by the states. Although the FERC
has set forth a general test for determining whether facilities perform a non-jurisdictional gathering function or a jurisdictional transmission
function, the FERC s determinations as to the classification of facilities is done on a case-by-case basis. State regulation of
natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take
requirements. Although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies, natural gas gathering may receive
greater regulatory scrutiny in the future. 

15 

Intrastate
natural gas transportation and facilities are also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies, and certain transportation services
provided by intrastate pipelines are also regulated by FERC. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the
degree of state regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state.
Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a
comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any state in which we
operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those
of our competitors in that state. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation
rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. 

Environmental
Matters 

Our
operations and properties are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental
protection, including the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment, and
relating to safety and health. The recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation generally is toward stricter standards, and
this trend will likely continue. These laws and regulations may: 

require
 the acquisition of a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and for certain other activities; 

limit
 or prohibit construction, drilling and other activities on certain lands lying within wilderness and other protected areas; and 

impose
 substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations. 

The
permits required for our operations may be subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities. Governmental authorities
have the power to enforce their regulations, and violations are subject to fines or injunctions, or both. In the opinion of management,
we are in compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations, and have no material commitments for capital expenditures
to comply with existing environmental requirements. Nevertheless, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or in interpretations
thereof could have a significant impact on us, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general. 

The
Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation, and Liability Act CERCLA and comparable state statutes impose strict,
joint and several liability on owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous
substances found at such sites. It is not uncommon for the neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal
injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. The Federal Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act RCRA and comparable state statutes govern the disposal of solid waste and hazardous
waste and authorize the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance. Although CERCLA currently excludes petroleum
from its definition of hazardous substance, state laws affecting our operations may impose clean-up liability relating
to petroleum and petroleum related products. In addition, although RCRA classifies certain oil field wastes as non-hazardous, 
such exploration and production wastes could be reclassified as hazardous wastes thereby making such wastes subject to more stringent
handling and disposal requirements. Recent regulation and litigation that has been brought against others in the industry under RCRA
concern liability for earthquakes that were allegedly caused by injection of oil field wastes. 

The
Endangered Species Act ESA seeks to ensure that activities do not jeopardize endangered or threatened animal, fish and
plant species, nor destroy or modify the critical habitat of such species. Under ESA, exploration and production operations, as well
as actions by federal agencies, may not significantly impair or jeopardize the species or its habitat. ESA provides for criminal penalties
for willful violations of ESA. Other statutes that provide protection to animal and plant species and that may apply to our operations
include, but are not necessarily limited to, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the
Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the National Historic Preservation Act. Although we believe that our operations are in compliance with
such statutes, any change in these statutes or any reclassification of a species as endangered could subject us (directly or indirectly
through our operating partners) to significant expenses to modify our operations or could force discontinuation of certain operations
altogether. 

The
Clean Air Act CAA controls air emissions from oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations, among
other sources. CAA regulations include New Source Performance Standards NSPS for the oil and natural gas source category
to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds VOCs and a separate set of emission standards to
address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities. 

On
November 2, 2021, the Environmental Protection Agency EPA proposed to revise and add to the NSPS program rules. These
rules, if adopted, could have a significant impact on the upstream and midstream oil and gas sectors. The proposed rule would formally
reinstate methane emission limitations for existing and modified facilities in the oil and gas sector. Methane is a greenhouse gas. The
proposed rules also would regulate, for the first time under the NSPS program, existing oil and gas facilities. Specifically, EPA s
proposed new rule would require states to implement plans that meet or exceed federally established emission reduction guidelines for
oil and natural gas facilities. About a year after that proposal, the EPA proposed rules that strengthened and expanded the November
2021 proposal. The November 2022 EPA statement would require more monitoring of small, high-polluting wells, tracking of super-emitters ,
inspection of abandoned wells until their closure, further reduction in flaring, and use of zero-emissions control equipment on hydrocarbon
equipment. Comments regarding the November 2022 proposal will be presented to the EPA in January, 2023, after which the EPA may act. 

16 

On
August 16, 2022, the IRA was signed into law. The IRA imposes an escalating charge on methane emissions from inter alia onshore petroleum
and natural gas production, and natural gas processing, gathering, transmission, underground storage, and LNG storage/ import/export
equipment. The charges apply only to facilities emitting 25,000 metric tons of CO2 annually The IRA also funds grants to facilities subject
to the methane charge and marginal conventional wells to improve equipment and processes. The IRA also creates generous
tax credits, benefitting even non-profit entities, that likely will create more supply and demand for alternative non-hydrocarbon energy
which may diminish demand, or prices obtained, for natural gas and oil. These statutory provisions will also be subject to legal challenge.
The cumulative effect upon our business results of the IRA s grants, charges, and incentives to non-hydrocarbon energy assets
and fuels, is uncertain. 

Additionally,
various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives
that are focused on such areas as greenhouse gas cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction
of emissions. At the international level, there exists the United Nations-sponsored Paris Agreement, which is a non-binding agreement
for nations to limit their greenhouse gas emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020. While
the United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement effective November 4, 2020, President Biden recommitted the United States to the
Paris Agreement on January 20, 2021. 

These
regulations and proposals and any other new regulations requiring the installation of more sophisticated pollution control equipment
could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

The
Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, or the Clean Water Act (the CWA ), imposes restrictions and controls on the
discharge of produced waters and other pollutants into waters of the United States WOTUS ). Permits must be obtained to
discharge pollutants into state and federal waters and to conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands. 

The
CWA and certain state regulations prohibit the discharge of produced water, sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings, sediment and certain
other substances related to the oil and gas industry into certain coastal and offshore waters without an individual or general National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System discharge permit. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or
coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. CWA jurisdiction depends on the
definition of WOTUS. On December 7, 2021, EPA and the Corps of Engineers proposed a rule to revise the definition of WOTUS, that would
potentially expand CWA jurisdiction to include more features in areas where oil and gas operations are conducted. Some states also maintain
groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. In 2021, the
United States Supreme Court held that the CWA requires a discharge permit if the addition of pollutants through groundwater is the functional
equivalent of a direct discharge from the point source into navigable waters. Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater
and/or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans. 

The
CAA, CWA and comparable state statutes provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of oil and
other pollutants and impose liability on parties responsible for those discharges, for the costs of cleaning up any environmental damage
caused by the release and for natural resource damages resulting from the release. 

New
Mexico implemented in 2021 new standards mandating 98 of natural gas emissions be captured, and a prohibition on natural gas flaring
to take effect in 2026. In addition, New Mexico in 2022 implemented restrictions, that are more stringent than federal rules, on emissions
of volatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen, commonly occurring in connection with production of hydrocarbons. The State of
New Mexico characterized the new rules as addressing outsized emissions from smaller, leak-prone wells. 

The
underground injection of oil and natural gas wastes are regulated by the Underground Injection Control program authorized by the Safe
Drinking Water Act. The primary objective of injection well operating requirements is to ensure the mechanical integrity of the injection
apparatus and to prevent migration of fluids from the injection zone into underground sources of drinking water. Substantially all of
the oil and natural gas production in which we have interest is developed from unconventional sources that require hydraulic fracturing
as part of the completion process. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation
to stimulate gas production. Legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the
definition of underground injection and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well
as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, were proposed
in recent sessions of Congress. The U.S. Congress continues to consider legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to address hydraulic
fracturing operations. 

17 

Scrutiny
of hydraulic fracturing activities continues in other ways. The federal government is currently undertaking several studies of hydraulic
fracturing s potential impacts. Several states have also proposed or adopted legislative or regulatory restrictions on hydraulic
fracturing. A number of municipalities in other states have enacted bans on hydraulic fracturing. We cannot predict whether any other
legislation will ever be enacted and if so, what its provisions would be. If additional levels of regulation and permits were required
through the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal or state level, it could lead to delays, increased operating costs and
process prohibitions that would materially adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. 

The
National Environmental Policy Act NEPA establishes a national environmental policy and goals for the protection, maintenance
and enhancement of the environment and provides a process for implementing these goals within federal agencies. A major federal agency
action having the potential to significantly impact the environment requires review under NEPA. In 2021, the Biden Administration proposed
a rule to undue changes to NEPA enacted under the Trump Administration that had streamlined NEPA review. The proposed changes would emphasize
the need to review federal actions for climate change and environmental justice impacts, among other factors. These proposed changes,
if enacted, would affect the assessment of projects ranging from oil and gas leasing to development on public and Indian lands. 

Climate
Change 

Significant
studies and research have been devoted to climate change, and climate change has developed into a major political issue in the United
States and globally. Certain research suggests that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change and pose a threat to the environment.
Recent scientific research and political debate has focused in part on carbon dioxide and methane incidental to oil and natural gas exploration
and production. 

In
the United States, no comprehensive federal climate change legislation has been implemented to date but the current administration
has indicated willingness to pursue new climate change legislation, executive actions or other regulatory initiatives to limit
greenhouse gas GHG emissions. These include rejoining the Paris Agreement treaty on climate change, several
executive orders to address climate change, the U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan, and a commitment to cut greenhouse gas
emissions 50-52 percent of 2005 levels by 2030. Further, legislative and regulatory initiatives are underway to that purpose. The
U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would control GHG emissions through a cap and trade program and several
states have already implemented programs to reduce GHG emissions. The U.S. Supreme Court determined that GHG emissions fall within
the CAA definition of an air pollutant. Recent litigation has held that if a source was subject to Prevention of
Significant Deterioration PSD or Title V based on emissions of conventional pollutants like sulfur dioxide,
particulates, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone or lead, then the EPA could also require the source to control GHG emissions
and the source would have to install Best Available Control Technology to do so. As a result, a source may still have to control GHG
emissions if it is an otherwise regulated source. 

The
SEC in 2022 proposed rules requiring disclosure of how climate-related risks are likely to materially impact publicly-traded enterprises 
finances, strategies and outlook and the impact of climate-related events upon a company s consolidated financial statements 
line items. Final action on this proposed rule is pending. Companies must also identify transition strategies. Compliance
with the proposed rule would increase our costs. 

In
2014, Colorado was the first state in the nation to adopt rules to control methane emissions from oil and gas facilities. In 2016, the
EPA revised and expanded NSPS to include final rules to curb emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas, from new, reconstructed and modified
oil and gas sources. Previously, already existing NSPS regulated VOCs, and controlling VOCs also had the effect of controlling methane,
because natural gas leaks emit both compounds. However, by explicitly regulating methane as a separate air pollutant, the 2016 regulations
were a statutory predicate to propose regulating emissions from existing oil and gas facilities. In September 2020, EPA made technical
and policy changes to the methane rules that limited the scope of the rules. In 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 13990, Protecting
Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis. In furtherance of this Executive Order, the EPA,
on November 2, 2021, proposed rules to regulate methane emissions from the oil and natural gas industry, including, for the first time,
reductions from certain upstream and midstream existing oil and gas sources. These regulations also expanded controls to reduce methane
emissions, such as enhancement of leak detection and repair provisions. The PHMSA and the Department of Interior continue to focus on
regulatory initiatives to control methane emissions from upstream and midstream equipment. To the extent that these regulations or initiatives
remain in place and to the extent that our third-party operating partners are required to further control methane emissions, such controls
could impact our business. 

In
addition, some of our third-party operating partners are required to report their GHG emissions under CAA rules. Because regulation of
GHG emissions continues to evolve, further regulatory, legislative and judicial developments are likely to occur. Such developments may
affect how these GHG initiatives will impact us. Moreover, while the U.S. Supreme Court held in its 2011 decision American Electric
Power Co. v. Connecticut that, with respect to claims concerning GHG emissions, the federal common law of nuisance was displaced
by the CAA, the Court left open the question of whether tort claims against sources of GHG emissions alleging property damage may proceed
under state common law. There thus remains some litigation risk for such claims. Due to the uncertainties surrounding the regulation
of and other risks associated with GHG emissions, we cannot predict the financial impact of related developments on us. 

18 

The
FERC has issued policy statements articulating how it will quantify natural GHG emissions, departing from past practices. 

Legislation
or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more
or less desirable than competing sources of energy. To the extent that our products are competing with higher GHG emitting energy sources,
our products would become more desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on GHG emissions. To the extent that our products
are competing with lower GHG emitting energy sources such as solar and wind, our products would become less desirable in the market with
more stringent limitations on GHG emissions. We cannot predict with any certainty at this time how these possibilities may affect our
operations. 

Depending
on the outcome of future carbon emission rulemakings under the CAA targeting new and existing power plants, and demand for
hydrocarbons may be reduced. In addition, we anticipate that such regulations will be challenged in federal court prior to their implementation.
Depending on the outcome of such judicial review, the hydrocarbon production industry may face alternative efforts from private parties
seeking to establish alternative GHG emission limitations from power plants. Alternative GHG emission limitations may arise from litigation
under either federal or state common laws or citizen suit provisions of federal environmental statutes that attempt to force federal
agency rulemaking or imposing emission limitations. Such lawsuits may also see damages from harm alleged to have resulted from GHG emissions. 

Physical
and Operational Risks. Weather extremes such as drought and high temperature variations are common occurrences in the southwest United
States. Large increases in ambient temperatures could require evaluation of certain materials used within its system and may represent
a greater challenge. As part of conducting our business, we recognize that the southwestern United States is particularly susceptible
to the risks posed by climate change, which over time is projected to exacerbate high temperature extremes and prolong drought in the
area. Texas has recently experienced extended droughts. Prolonged and extreme drought conditions can also affect our long-term ability
to access water resources. Reductions in the availability of water for injections could negatively impact our financial condition, results
of operations or cash flows. 

Effects
of Energy Conservation Measures and Distributed Energy Resources. Some state legislatures and agencies have established rules regarding
energy efficiency that mandate energy savings requirements which in turn will impact the demand for electricity. 

In
addition to these rules and requirements, energy efficiency technologies and distributed energy resources continue to evolve, which may
have similar impacts on demand for electricity. Reduced demand due to these energy efficiency requirements, distributed energy requirements
and other emerging technologies, could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition results of operations and cash flow
of our indirect customers. 

Operational
Hazards and Insurance 

The
oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks, including the risk of fire, explosions, well blow-outs, pipe failures,
industrial accidents, and, in some cases, abnormally high pressure formations which could lead to environmental hazards such as oil releases,
chemical releases, natural gas leaks and the discharge of toxic gases. Any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct
operations or result in substantial losses to us, for example, as a result of damage to our property or equipment or injury to our personnel.
These operational risks could also result in the spill or release of hazardous materials such as drilling fluids or other chemicals,
which may result in pollution, natural resource damages, or other environmental damage and necessitate investigation and remediation
costs. As a result, we could be subject to liability under environmental law or common law theories. In addition, these operational risks
could result in the suspension or delay of our operations, which could have significant adverse consequences on our business. 

In
accordance with customary industry practices, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the operating risks to which our business
is exposed. We cannot provide assurance that any insurance we obtain will be adequate to cover our losses or liabilities. Pollution and
environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Under certain circumstances, we may be liable for environmental damage caused
by previous owners or operators of properties that we own, lease or operate. As a result, we may incur substantial liabilities to third
parties or governmental entities for environmental matters for which we do not have insurance coverage, which could reduce or eliminate
funds available for exploration, development or acquisitions or cause us to incur losses. 

The
occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations
and cash flows.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

The
following disclosures should be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These disclosures are intended to discuss certain material risks of the Company s
business as they appear to Management at this time. However, this list is not exhaustive. Other risks may, and likely will, arise from
time to time. 

Risks
Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital 

If
we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we will be unable to continue our operations and you will likely lose
your entire investment. 

We
are in the early stages of our operations and have not generated revenue in excess of our expenses. We will likely operate at a loss
until our business becomes established, and we may require additional financing in order to fund future operations and expansion plans.
Our ability to secure any required financing to sustain operations will depend in part upon prevailing capital market conditions and
the success of our operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to secure any additional financing
or additional financing on terms satisfactory to us. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we
may be required to scale back our current business plan or cease operations. 

Even
if we can raise additional funding, we may be required to do so on terms that are dilutive to you. 

The
capital markets have been unpredictable in the recent past. In addition, it is generally difficult for early stage companies to raise
capital under current market conditions. The amount of capital that a company such as ours is able to raise often depends on variables
that are beyond our control. As a result, we may not be able to secure financing on terms attractive to us, or at all. If we are able
to consummate a financing arrangement, the amount raised may not be sufficient to meet our future needs and may be dilutive to our current
shareholders. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, or at all, our business, including our results of operations,
financial condition and our continued viability will be materially adversely affected. 

We
have a limited operating history. 

We
have a limited operating history and our business is subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise.
Our likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered
in connection with development and expansion of a new business enterprise. If we are unable to achieve profitability, we may be unable
to continue our operations. 

Our
indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund operations. 

We
currently have one outstanding secured convertible debenture in the original principal amount of 79,000 (CAD 100,000) (excluding interest
accrued thereon) issued to Mehran Ehsan, our Chief Executive Officer, President and director, which is secured by all of our right, title
and interest in the Properties (as defined in the Security Agreement between us the Mehran Ehsan dated February 21, 2020) together with
all engineering reports and intellectual property related to, or generated by us, in connection with the Properties (collectively, the
 Collateral ). The secured debenture was repaid in December 2022. 

20 

If
we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may need to, among other things, dispose of some or all
of the Collateral or issue equity to obtain necessary funds. We do not know whether we will be able to do any of this on a timely basis,
on terms satisfactory to us, or at all. Our indebtedness could have important consequences, including: 

our
 ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions
 and general corporate or other purposes may be limited; 

a
 portion of our cash flows from operations may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on the indebtedness and will
 not be available for other purposes, including operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities; and 

we
 may be vulnerable during a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business, or may be unable to carry on capital spending
 that is important to our growth. 

Risks
Related to Our Business 

Oil
and gas prices are volatile, and declines in prices may adversely affect our financial position, financial results, cash flows, access
to capital and ability to grow. 

The
prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production heavily influence our revenue, operating results, profitability, access to capital,
future rate of growth and carrying value of our properties. Oil and natural gas are commodities, and, therefore, their prices are subject
to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand, as well as costs and terms of transport to downstream
markets. 

Historically,
the commodities markets have been volatile, and these markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. If the prices of oil
and natural gas experience a substantial decline, our operations, financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of
our oil and natural gas reserves may be materially and adversely affected. The prices we receive for our production, and the levels of
our production, depend on numerous factors beyond our control and include the following: 

changes
 in global supply and demand for oil and natural gas; 

the
 actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; 

political
 conditions, including embargoes, in or affecting other oil-producing activity; 

the
 level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity; 

the
 level of global oil and natural gas inventories; 

weather
 conditions; 

technological
 advances affecting energy consumption; and 

the
 price and availability of alternative fuels. 

Volatile
oil and natural gas prices make it difficult to estimate the value of producing properties for acquisition and often cause disruption
in the market for oil and natural gas producing properties, as buyers and sellers have difficulty agreeing on such value. Price volatility
also makes it difficult to budget for and project the return on acquisitions and development and exploitation projects. 

Our
revenues, operating results, profitability and future rate of growth depend primarily upon the prices we receive for oil and, to a lesser
extent, natural gas that we sell. Prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow
money or raise additional capital. In addition, we may need to record asset carrying value write-downs if prices fall. A significant
decline in the prices of natural gas or oil could adversely affect our financial position, financial results, cash flows, access to capital
and ability to grow. 

The
actual quantities and present value of our proved oil, gas, and NGL reserves may be less than we have estimated. 

There
are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves and their value. Reservoir engineering is a subjective
process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Because of the
high degree of judgment involved, the accuracy of any reserve estimate is inherently imprecise, and a function of the quality of available
data and the engineering and geological interpretation. Our reserves estimates are based on 12-month average prices, except where contractual
arrangements exist; therefore, reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease. In addition, results of drilling,
testing, and production may substantially change the reserve estimates for a given reservoir over time. The estimates of our proved reserves
and estimated future net revenues also depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results,
including: 

historical
 production from the area compared with production from other areas; 

the
 effects of regulations by governmental agencies, including changes to severance and excise taxes; 

future
 operating costs and capital expenditures; and 

workover
 and remediation costs. 

21 

For
these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group
of properties, classifications of those reserves and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different
engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially. Accordingly, reserves estimates may be subject to upward
or downward adjustment, and actual production, revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary, possibly materially,
from estimates. 

Additionally,
because some of our reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis, those estimates are less reliable than the estimates
based on a lengthy production history. Volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay
of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure. In addition, realization or recognition of proved undeveloped
reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans. A change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could
cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved. 

Our
acquisition strategy may subject us to certain risks associated with the inherent uncertainty in evaluating properties. 

Although
we perform a review of properties that we acquire that we believe is consistent with industry practices, such reviews are inherently
incomplete. It generally is not feasible to review in-depth every individual property involved in each acquisition. Ordinarily, we will
focus our review efforts on the higher-value properties and will sample the remainder. However, even a detailed review of records and
properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us as a buyer to become sufficiently familiar
with the properties to assess fully and accurately their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every
well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken.
Even when problems are identified, we often assume certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired
properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates
and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. In addition,
there can be no assurance that acquisitions will not have an adverse effect upon our operating results, particularly during the periods
in which the operations of acquired businesses are being integrated into our ongoing operations. 

We
may be unable to successfully integrate recently acquired assets or any assets we may acquire in the future into our business or achieve
the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions. 

Our
ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions will depend in part upon whether we can integrate the acquired assets
into our existing business in an efficient and effective manner. We may not be able to accomplish this integration process successfully.
The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including: 

recoverable
 reserves; 

future
 oil and natural gas prices and their appropriate differentials; 

availability
 and cost of transportation of production to markets; 

availability
 and cost of drilling equipment and of skilled personnel; 

development
 and operating costs including access to water and potential environmental and other liabilities; and 

regulatory,
 permitting and similar matters. 

The
accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we have performed reviews of the subject
properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. The reviews are based on our analysis of historical production
data, assumptions regarding capital expenditures and anticipated production declines without review by an independent petroleum engineering
firm. Data used in such reviews are typically furnished by the seller or obtained from publicly available sources. Our review may not
reveal all existing or potential problems or permit us to fully assess the deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves for all of
the acquired properties, and the reserves and production related to the acquired properties may differ materially after such data is
reviewed by an independent petroleum engineering firm or further by us. Inspections will not always be performed on every well, and environmental
problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling
or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or a portion of the underlying deficiencies. The integration process
may be subject to delays or changed circumstances, and we can give no assurance that our acquired assets will perform in accordance with
our expectations or that our expectations with respect to integration or cost savings as a result of such acquisitions will materialize. 

22 

Drilling
for and producing oil, natural gas and NGLs are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our financial
condition or results of operations. 

Our
drilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that they will not discover commercially productive reservoirs. Drilling
for oil or natural gas can be uneconomical, not only from dry holes, but also from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues
to be commercially viable. In addition, drilling and producing operations on our acreage may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result
of other factors, including: 

declines
 in oil or natural gas prices, as occurred in 2020 in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic; 

infrastructure
 limitations; 

the
 high cost, shortages or delays of equipment, materials and services; 

unexpected
 operational events, pipeline ruptures or spills, adverse weather conditions, facility malfunctions or title problems; 

compliance
 with environmental and other governmental requirements; 

regulations,
 restrictions, moratoria and bans on injection wells and water disposal; 

unusual
 or unexpected geological formations; 

environmental
 hazards, such as oil, natural gas or well fluids spills or releases, pipeline or tank ruptures and discharges of toxic gas; 

fires,
 blowouts, craterings and explosions; 

uncontrollable
 flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids; 

changes
 in the cost of decommissioning or plugging wells; 

maintenance
 of quality, purity and thermal quality standards both for commodity sales and purposes of transportation; 

members
 of the public have engaged in physical confrontations or acts of sabotage to impede or prevent transportation of hydrocarbons; and 

pipeline
 capacity curtailments. 

In
addition to causing curtailments, delays and cancellations of drilling and producing operations, many of these events can cause substantial
losses, including personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution,
environmental contamination, loss of wells and regulatory penalties. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance
could have a material adverse impact on our business activities, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our
future success depends on our ability to replace reserves. 

Because
the rate of production from oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted, our future success depends upon
our ability to economically find or acquire and produce additional oil and natural gas reserves. Except to the extent that we acquire
additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies,
identify additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline as our reserves are produced.
Future oil and natural gas production, therefore, is highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves
that are economically recoverable. We cannot assure you that we will be able to find or acquire and develop additional reserves at an
acceptable cost. We may acquire significant amounts of unproved property to further our development efforts. Development and exploratory
drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered.
We seek to acquire both proved and producing properties as well as undeveloped acreage that we believe will enhance growth potential
and increase our earnings over time. However, we cannot assure you that all of these properties will contain economically viable reserves
or that we will not abandon our initial investments. Additionally, we cannot assure you that unproved reserves or undeveloped acreage
that we acquire will be profitably developed, that new wells drilled on our properties will be productive or that we will recover all
or any portion of our investments in our properties and reserves. 

Our
business depends on third-party transportation and processing facilities and other assets that are owned by third parties. 

The
marketability of our oil and natural gas depends in part on the availability, proximity, capacity and cost of pipeline and gathering
systems, processing facilities, oil trucking and barging fleets and rail transportation assets as well as storage facilities owned by
third parties. The lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities, whether as a result of proration, growth in demand outpacing
growth in capacity, physical damage, scheduled maintenance or other reasons could result in a substantial increase in costs, declines
in realized commodity prices, the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for our properties.
In addition, our wells may be drilled in locations that are serviced to a limited extent, if at all, by gathering and transportation
pipelines, which may or may not have sufficient capacity to transport production from all of the wells in the area. As a result, we rely
on third-party oil trucking to transport a significant portion of our production to third-party transportation pipelines, rail loading
facilities and other market access points. In addition, concerns about the safety and security of oil and gas transportation by pipeline
may result in public opposition to pipeline development or continued operation and increased regulation of pipelines by the PHMSA, and
therefore less capacity to transport our products by pipeline. Any significant curtailment in gathering system or pipeline capacity,
or the unavailability of sufficient third-party trucking or rail capacity, could adversely affect our business, results of operations
and financial condition. Our contracts for downstream transportation service include those that may be adjusted on a month-to-month basis,
impacting underlying economics of our production. Our downstream contract transportation counterparties include entities that are far
larger than we are and have greater market share in their markets than is the case for us in our markets. 

23 

The
development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently
anticipate. Therefore, our undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced. 

Approximately
92 of our estimated net proved reserves volumes were classified as proved undeveloped as of September 30, 2021. Development of these
reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Delays in the development of
our reserves or increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves will reduce the PV-10 value of our estimated proved undeveloped
reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, delays
in the development of reserves could cause us to have to reclassify our proved reserves as unproved reserves. 

Weather
conditions, which could become more frequent or severe due to climate change, could adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling,
completion and production activities in the areas where we operate. 

Our
exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by severe weather such as well freeze-offs, which may
cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment. Our planning for normal climatic variation,
insurance programs, and emergency recovery plans may inadequately mitigate the effects of such weather conditions, and not all such effects
can be predicted, eliminated, or insured against. In addition, demand for oil and gas are, to a degree, dependent on weather and climate,
which impact the price we receive for the commodities we produce. These constraints could delay or temporarily halt our operations and
materially increase our operation and capital costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. 

We
may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest. 

The
existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless. In the course of acquiring the rights to develop natural gas,
we typically execute a lease agreement with payment to the lessor subject to title verification. In many cases, we incur the expense
of retaining lawyers to verify the rightful owners of the gas interests prior to payment of such lease bonus to the lessor. There is
no certainty, however, that a lessor has valid title to their lease s gas interests. In those cases, such leases are generally
voided and payment is not remitted to the lessor. As such, title failures may result in fewer net acres to us. Prior to the drilling
of a natural gas well, however, it is the normal practice in our industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well
to obtain a preliminary title review to ensure there are no obvious defects in title to the well. Frequently, as a result of such examinations,
certain curative work must be done to correct defects in the marketability of the title, and such curative work entails expense. Our
failure to cure any title defects may delay or prevent us from utilizing the associated mineral interest, which may adversely impact
our ability in the future to increase production and reserves. Accordingly, undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than
developed acreage. If there are any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest,
we will suffer a financial loss. Additionally, hydrocarbons or other fluids in one reservoir may migrate to another stratum or reservoir,
resulting in disputes regarding ownership, the entitlement to produce, and responsibility for consequences of such migration of the fluids. 

We
conduct business in a highly competitive industry. 

The
oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. The key areas in respect of which we face competition include: acquisition of assets
offered for sale by other companies; access to capital (debt and equity) for financing and operational purposes; purchasing, leasing,
hiring, chartering or other procuring of equipment that may be scarce; and employment of qualified and experienced skilled management
and oil and natural gas professionals. Competition in our markets is intense and depends, among other things, on the number of competitors
in the market, their financial resources, their degree of geological, geophysical, engineering and management expertise and capabilities,
their pricing policies, their ability to develop properties on time and on budget, their ability to select, acquire and develop reserves
and their ability to foster and maintain relationships with the relevant authorities. Our competitors also include those entities with
greater technical, physical and financial resources. In some markets, our products compete with other sources of energy, or other fuels
(e.g., hydroelectricity) that may from time to time become more abundant or experience decreased prices. Finally, companies and certain
private equity firms not previously investing in oil and natural gas may choose to acquire reserves to establish a firm supply or simply
as an investment. Any such companies will also increase market competition which may directly affect us. If we are unsuccessful in competing
against other companies, our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects could be materially adversely affected. 

24 

Decommissioning
costs are unknown and may be substantial. Unplanned costs could divert resources from other projects. 

We
may become responsible for costs associated with plugging, abandoning and reclaiming wells, pipelines and other facilities that we use
for production of oil and natural gas reserves. Abandonment and reclamation of these facilities and the costs associated therewith is
often referred to as decommissioning. We accrue a liability for decommissioning costs associated with our wells, but have
not established any cash reserve account for these potential costs in respect of any of our properties. If decommissioning is required
before economic depletion of our properties or if our estimates of the costs of decommissioning exceed the value of the reserves remaining
at any particular time to cover such decommissioning costs, we may have to draw on funds from other sources to satisfy such costs. The
use of other funds to satisfy such decommissioning costs could impair our ability to focus capital investment in other areas of our business. 

Fuel
conservation measures, technological advances and negative shift in market perception towards the oil and natural gas industry could
reduce demand for oil and natural gas. 

Fuel
conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, technological
advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices, and the increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources could reduce
demand for oil and natural gas. Additionally, the increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources (such as electric vehicles,
wind, solar, geothermal, tidal, fuel cells and biofuels) could reduce demand for oil and natural gas and, therefore, our revenues. 

Additionally,
certain segments of the investor community have recently expressed negative sentiment towards investing in the oil and natural gas industry.
Recent equity returns in the sector versus other industry sectors have led to lower oil and natural gas representation in certain key
equity market indices. Some investors, including certain pension funds, university endowments and family foundations, have stated policies
to reduce or eliminate their investments in the oil and natural gas sector based on social and environmental considerations. Furthermore,
certain other stakeholders have pressured commercial and investment banks to stop funding oil and gas projects. With the continued volatility
in oil and natural gas prices, and the possibility that interest rates will rise in the near term, increasing the cost of borrowing,
certain investors have emphasized capital efficiency and free cash flow from earnings as key drivers for energy companies, especially
shale producers. This may also result in a reduction of available capital funding for potential development projects, further impacting
our future financial results. Some states attorneys general have accused large legacy E P companies of purposefully obscuring consequences
of combusting hydrocarbon. 

The
impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products, together with a change in investor sentiment, may have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, if we are unable to
achieve the desired level of capital efficiency or free cash flow within the timeframe expected by the market, our share price may be
adversely affected. 

Major
utilities, sometimes at the instigation of states or investors, have announced plans to radically reduce emissions, or goals to achieve
 net-zero carbon emissions by deadlines as early as 2035. 

Diminution
of available markets (for instance by bans on the consumption of natural gas as a fuel for power plants) or prohibitions on use of natural
gas in new construction as early as 2027 also may affect our markets, profitability and cash flow. 

Our
operations are concentrated in the Permian and Delaware Basins, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a limited
geographic area. 

All
of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Permian and Delaware Basins. As a result, we may be disproportionately
exposed to various factors, including, among others: (i) the impact of regional supply and demand factors, (ii) delays or interruptions
of production from wells in such areas caused by governmental regulation, (iii) processing or transportation capacity constraints, (iv)
market limitations, (v) availability of equipment and personnel, (vi) water shortages or other drought related conditions or (vii) interruption
of the processing or transportation natural gas. This concentration in a limited geographic area also increases our exposure to changes
in local laws and regulations, certain lease stipulations designed to protect wildlife and unexpected events that may occur in the regions
such as natural disasters, seismic events, industrial accidents or labor difficulties. Any one of these factors has the potential to
cause producing wells to be shut-in, delay operations, decrease cash flows, increase operating and capital costs and prevent development
of lease inventory before expirations. Any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flow. 

Increased
attention to environmental, social and governance ESG matters may impact our business. 

Increasing
attention to climate change, increasing societal expectations on companies to address climate change, increasing investor and societal
expectations regarding voluntary ESG disclosures, and potential increasing consumer demand for alternative forms of energy may result
in increased costs, reduced demand for our products, reduced profits, increased investigations and litigation, and negative impacts on
our access to capital markets. Increasing attention to climate change, for example, may result in demand shifts for natural gas and oil
products and additional governmental investigations and private litigation against us. To the extent that societal pressures or political
or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to our causation of or contribution
to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. 

25 

In
addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes
for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting
decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings and recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could
lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us and our industry and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which
could have a negative impact on our share price and our access to and costs of capital, or negative tax or other cost consequences. 

Under
some analyses, the world already produces more fossil fuel from existing sources than can be consumed over remaining resources service
lives, if incremental global warming is to be kept under 1.5 degrees Celsius. Financing may be increasingly challenging, as pension funds e.g ., for major municipalities such as Boston, MA) and financial institutions divest fossil fuel investments. 

The
COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

We
face risks related to public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including travel bans,
prohibitions on group events and gatherings, shutdowns of certain businesses, curfews, shelter-in-place orders and recommendations to
practice social distancing in addition to other actions taken by both businesses and governments, resulted in a significant and swift
reduction in international and U.S. economic activity. The collapse in the demand for oil caused by this unprecedented global health
and economic crisis contributed to the significant decrease in crude oil prices in 2020 in general and resulted in shut down of our wellbores
which had and could in the future continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Since
the beginning of 2021, the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines progressed and many government-imposed restrictions were relaxed or rescinded.
However, we continue to monitor the effects of the pandemic on our operations. As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our operations,
and those of our operating partners, have and may continue to experience delays or disruptions and temporary suspensions of operations
and increased volatility. In addition, our results of operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be adversely affected
by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 

The
extent to which our operating and financial results are affected by COVID-19 will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our
control, such as the emergence of more contagious and harmful variants of the COVID-19 virus, the duration and scope of the pandemic,
additional actions by businesses and governments in response to the pandemic, and the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat
the virus. COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, could also aggravate the other
risk factors that we identify herein. While the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have lessened recently in the United States, we cannot
predict the duration or future effects of the pandemic, or more contagious and harmful variants of the COVID-19 virus, and such effects
may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in a manner that is not currently known to us or that
we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our operations. 

The
loss of any member of our management team, upon whose knowledge, relationships with industry participants, leadership and technical expertise
we rely could diminish our ability to conduct our operations and harm our ability to execute our business plan. 

Our
success depends heavily upon the continued contributions of those members of our management team whose knowledge, relationships with
industry participants, leadership and technical expertise would be difficult to replace. In particular, our ability to successfully acquire
additional properties, to increase our reserves, to participate in drilling opportunities and to identify and enter into commercial arrangements
depends on developing and maintaining close working relationships with industry participants. In addition, our ability to select and
evaluate suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment is dependent on our management team s
knowledge and expertise in the industry. To continue to develop our business, we rely on our management team s knowledge and expertise
in the industry. The members of our management team may terminate their employment with our Company at any time. If we were to lose members
of our management team, we may not be able to replace the knowledge or relationships that they possess and our ability to execute our
business plan could be materially harmed. 

We
are substantially dependent on a limited number of customers. 

For the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, we had three and one significant
purchaser that accounted for approximately 83 and 90 , respectively, of our total oil, natural gas and NGL revenues. If we lost one or
more of these significant purchasers and were unable to sell our production to other purchasers on terms we consider acceptable, it could
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, there are no assurances
that we will be able to expand our customer base. If we are unable to attract and maintain an adequate customer base to generate revenues,
we will have to suspend or cease operations. 

26 

Our
business could be negatively affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats and other disruptions. 

As
an oil and gas producer, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information
or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure,
such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. The potential for such security threats has subjected our operations
to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, our implementation of various procedures
and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information facilities and infrastructure may
result in increased capital and operating costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient
to prevent security breaches from occurring. If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of sensitive
information, critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation,
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated and include,
but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems and other electronic security breaches
that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption
of data. These events could lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability. 

The
unavailability, high cost or shortages of rigs, equipment, raw materials, supplies or personnel may restrict or result in increased costs
for operators related to developing and operating our properties. 

The
oil and natural gas industry is cyclical, which can result in shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, raw materials (particularly water
and sand and other proppants), supplies and personnel. When shortages occur, the costs and delivery times of rigs, equipment and supplies
increase and demand for, and wage rates of, qualified drilling rig crews also rise with increases in demand. We cannot predict whether
these conditions will exist in the future and, if so, what their timing and duration will be. In accordance with customary industry practice,
our operators rely on independent third-party service providers to provide many of the services and equipment necessary to drill new
wells. If our operators are unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at reasonable costs, our financial condition and results
of operations could suffer. Shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, raw materials, supplies, personnel, trucking services, tubulars, fracking
and completion services and production equipment could delay or restrict our operators exploration and development operations,
which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and free cash flow. 

If
we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our future drilling and operations or are unable to dispose of the water we use
at a reasonable cost and pursuant to applicable environmental rules, our ability to produce oil and natural gas commercially and in commercial
quantities could be impaired. 

We
will be using a substantial amount of water in future drilling programs and hydraulic fracturing operations. Our inability to obtain
sufficient amounts of water at reasonable prices, or treat and dispose of water after drilling and hydraulic fracturing, could adversely
impact our operations. Moreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability
to conduct certain operations such as (i) hydraulic fracturing, including, but not limited to, the use of fresh water in such operations,
or (ii) disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, the disposal of produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated
with the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas. Opponents of hydraulic fracturing contend that either the drilling
process or the sub-surface injection of fluids, such as water and drilling fluids, as part of accessing hydrocarbons, or disposing of
used injection fluids, creates or magnifies seismic disturbances, and should such contentions be given credence with regard to our Company,
our operations could experience more regulation, higher costs or greater delays in accessing hydrocarbon resources, or claims of parties
asserting damage arising from seismic activity. Furthermore, future environmental regulations and permitting requirements governing the
withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells could increase operating costs
and cause delays, interruptions or termination of operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, and all of which could have an
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While we intend to conduct our operations
with the level of care necessary to avoid such claims, if the structural integrity of non-producing subsurface strata are impaired by
hydraulic fracturing, we could face claims for damages (e.g., claims that we are producing from other geologic strata to which we do
not have production rights). 

Risks
Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters 

Our
business is highly regulated and governmental authorities can delay or deny permits and approvals or change legal requirements governing
our operations, including well stimulation, enhanced production techniques and fluid injection or disposal, that could increase costs,
restrict operations and delay our implementation of, or cause us to change, our business strategy. 

27 

Our
operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, state, local and other laws and regulations relating to environmental protection
and the exploration and development of our properties, as well as the production, transportation, marketing and sale of our products.
See Business Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters for a further discussion of the laws and regulations
related to our operations. Federal, state and local agencies may assert overlapping authority to regulate in these areas. In addition,
certain of these laws and regulations may apply retroactively and may impose strict or joint and several liability on us for events or
conditions over which we and our predecessors had no control, without regard to fault, legality of the original activities, or ownership
or control by third parties. 

To
operate in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain permits, approvals and certificates from federal,
state and local government authorities for a variety of activities including siting, drilling, completion, stimulation, operation, maintenance,
transportation, marketing, site remediation, decommissioning, abandonment, fluid injection and disposal and water recycling and reuse.
These permits are generally subject to protest, appeal or litigation, which could in certain cases delay or halt projects, production
of wells and other operations. Additionally, failure to comply may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines
and penalties and liability for noncompliance, costs of corrective action, cleanup or restoration, compensation for personal injury,
property damage or other losses, and the imposition of injunctive or declaratory relief restricting or limiting our operations. Under
certain environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to strict or joint and several liability for the removal or remediation
of contamination, including on properties over which we and our predecessors had no control, without regard to fault, legality of the
original activities, or ownership or control by third parties. 

Our
operations may also be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife.
Such restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment,
services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed. Permanent restrictions imposed
to protect threatened or endangered species or their habitat could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of
expensive mitigation measures. 

Costs
of compliance may increase, and operational delays or restrictions may occur as existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted,
or as new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. Government authorities and other organizations continue to study
health, safety and environmental aspects of oil and natural gas operations, including those related to air, soil and water quality, ground
movement or seismicity and natural resources. Government authorities have also adopted or proposed new or more stringent requirements
for permitting, well construction and public disclosure or environmental review of, or restrictions on, oil and natural gas operations.
Such requirements or associated litigation could result in potentially significant added costs to comply, delay or curtail our exploration,
development, fluid injection and disposal or production activities, and preclude us from drilling, completing or stimulating wells, which
could have an adverse effect on our expected production, other operations and financial condition. 

Failure
to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in substantial penalties and adversely affect our business. 

As
an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign country laws
and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. See Business Governmental Regulation
and Environmental Matters . Changing law or regulations may impact market demand for our product. These laws and regulations may,
among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up and other remediation
activities resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution and other damages, limit or constrain operations
in affected areas, and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Our efforts to limit our exposure to such liability
and cost may prove inadequate and result in significant adverse effects to our results of operations. In addition, it is possible that
the increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies could require us to make significant capital
expenditures. Such capital expenditures could adversely impact our free cash flows and our financial condition. 

Certain
U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development may be eliminated
as a result of future legislation. 

From
time to time, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws, including certain
key U.S. federal income tax provisions currently available to oil and gas companies. Such legislative changes have included, but not
been limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for natural gas and oil properties, (ii) the elimination of current
deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and
geophysical expenditures. Although these provisions were largely unchanged in the most recent federal tax legislation, certain of these
changes were considered for inclusion in the proposed Build Back Better Act and Congress could consider, and could include,
some or all of these proposals as part of future tax reform legislation. Moreover, other more general features of any additional tax
reform legislation, including changes to cost recovery rules, may be developed that also would change the taxation of oil and gas companies.
It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted in future legislation and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could
take effect. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could
eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that currently are available with respect to oil and gas development or increase costs,
and any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

28 

Our
business involves the selling and shipping by rail of crude oil, which involves risks of derailment, accidents and liabilities associated
with cleanup and damages, as well as potential regulatory changes that may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results
of operations. 

A
portion of our crude oil production is transported to market centers by rail. Derailments in North America of trains transporting crude
oil have caused various regulatory agencies and industry organizations, as well as federal, state and municipal governments, to focus
attention on transportation by rail of flammable liquids. Any changes to existing laws and regulations, or promulgation of new laws and
regulations, including any voluntary measures by the rail industry, that result in new requirements for the design, construction or operation
of tank cars used to transport crude oil could increase our costs of doing business and limit our ability to transport and sell our crude
oil at favorable prices at market centers throughout the United States, the consequences of which could have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, any derailment of crude oil involving crude oil that we
have sold or are shipping may result in claims being brought against us that may involve significant liabilities. 

Federal
and state legislative and regulatory initiatives could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays. 

Hydraulic
fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate
production. The hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. Any federal or state legislative
or regulatory changes with respect to hydraulic fracturing could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs or result in operational
delays, and the consequences of any failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations. 

In
addition, in response to concerns relating to recent seismic events near underground disposal wells used for the disposal by injection
of flowback and produced water or certain other oilfield fluids resulting from oil and natural gas activities (so-called induced
seismicity ), regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of
produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. States may, from
time to time, develop and implement plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal
well operations. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells by our operators
to dispose of flowback and produced water and certain other oilfield fluids. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity
also could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and natural gas activities utilizing injection wells for waste
disposal. Until such pending or threatened legislation or regulations are finalized and implemented, it is not possible to estimate their
impact on our business. 

Any
of the above risks could impair our ability to manage our business and have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and
financial position. 

The
adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs
and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. 

Shortly
after taking office in January 2021, President Biden issued a series of executive orders designed to address climate change and requiring
agencies to review environmental actions taken by the Trump administration, as well as a memorandum to departments and agencies to refrain
from proposing or issuing rules until a departmental or agency head appointed or designated by the Biden administration has reviewed
and approved the rule. In November 2021, the Biden Administration released The Long-Term Strategy of the United States: Pathways
to Net-Zero Greenhouse Gas Emissions by 2050, which establishes a roadmap to net zero emissions in the United States by 2050 through,
among other things, improving energy efficiency; decarbonizing energy sources via electricity, hydrogen, and sustainable biofuels; and
reducing non-carbon dioxide GHG emissions, such as methane and nitrous oxide. These executive orders and policy priorities may result
in the development of additional regulations or changes to existing regulations, certain of which could negatively impact our financial
position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the United States is one of almost 200 nations that, in December 2015, agreed
to the Paris Agreement, an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions
targets and be transparent about the measures each country will take to achieve its GHG emissions targets. President Biden has recommitted
the United States to the Paris Agreement and, in April 2021, announced a goal of reducing the United States emissions by 50-52 
below 2005 levels by 2030. In November 2021, the international community gathered again in Glasgow at the 26th Conference to the Parties
on the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change during which multiple announcements were made, including a call for parties to eliminate
certain fossil fuel subsidies and pursue further action on non-carbon dioxide GHGs. Relatedly, the United States and European Union jointly
announced the launch of the Global Methane Pledge, which aims to cut global methane pollution at least 30 by 2030 relative
to 2020 levels, including all feasible reductions in the energy sector. In addition, several states and geographic regions
in the United States have also adopted legislation and regulations regarding climate change-related matters, and additional legislation
or regulation by these states and regions, U.S. federal agencies, including the EPA, and/or international agreements to which the United
States may become a party could result in increased compliance costs for us and our customers. Failure to comply with these laws and
regulations can lead to the imposition of remedial liabilities, administrative, civil or criminal fines or penalties or injunctions limiting
our operations in affected areas. Moreover, multiple environmental laws provide for citizen suits which allow environmental organizations
to act in the place of the government and sue operators for alleged violations of environmental law. We consider the responsibility and
costs of environmental protection and safety and health compliance fundamental, manageable parts of our business. We cannot predict with
any reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters. 

29 

Several states have adopted
or are considering adopting regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and/or well construction requirements
on hydraulic fracturing operations. We cannot predict whether additional federal, state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic
fracturing will be enacted in the future and, if so, what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit. If additional
levels of regulation or permitting requirements were imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations, our business and operations could be
subject to delays, increased operating and compliance costs and potential bans. Additional regulation could also lead to greater opposition
to hydraulic fracturing, including litigation. 

Restrictions on GHG emissions
that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and gas industry. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce GHG
emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire
emissions allowances or to comply with new regulatory requirements. Any GHG emissions legislation or regulatory programs applicable to
power plants or refineries could also increase the cost of consuming, and potentially reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce.
Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. See Business Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters 
and Climate Change for a further discussion of the laws and regulations related to GHGs and of climate change. 

We may be involved
in legal proceedings that could result in substantial liabilities. 

Similar to many oil and natural
gas companies, we may be involved in various legal and other proceedings from time to time, such as title, royalty or contractual disputes,
regulatory compliance matters and personal injury or property damage matters, in the ordinary course of our business. Such legal proceedings
are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted. Regardless of the outcome, such proceedings could have a material adverse
impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management and other personnel and other factors. In addition, resolution of one or
more such proceedings could result in liability, loss of contractual or other rights, penalties or sanctions, as well as judgments, consent
decrees or orders requiring a change in our business practices. Accruals for such liability, penalties or sanctions may be insufficient,
and judgments and estimates to determine accruals or range of losses related to legal and other proceedings could change from one period
to the next, and such changes could be material. 

Legislation or regulatory
initiatives intended to address seismic activity could restrict our operators drilling and production activities, which could have
a material adverse effect on our business. 

State and federal regulatory
agencies have recently focused on a possible connection between hydraulic fracturing related activities, particularly the underground
injection of wastewater into disposal wells, and the increased occurrence of seismic activity, and regulatory agencies at all levels are
continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity. For example, in 2015, the United States
Geological Study identified eight states, including Texas, with areas of increased rates of induced seismicity that could be attributed
to fluid injection or oil and gas extraction. 

In addition, a number of
lawsuits have been filed alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state
and federal rules regulating waste disposal. In response to these concerns, regulators in some states are seeking to impose additional
requirements, including requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess the relationship between
seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, in October 2014, the Texas Railroad Commission published a new rule governing permitting
or re-permitting of disposal wells that would require, among other things, the submission of information on seismic events occurring within
a specified radius of the disposal well location, as well as logs, geologic cross sections and structure maps relating to the disposal
area in question. If the permittee or an applicant of a disposal well permit fails to demonstrate that the produced water or other fluids
are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing
to seismic activity, then the agency may deny, modify, suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that
well. The Texas Railroad Commission has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells. In some instances, regulators may
also order that disposal wells be shut in. 

The adoption and implementation
of any new laws or regulations that restrict our operators ability to use hydraulic fracturing or dispose of produced water gathered
from drilling and production activities by limiting volumes, disposal rates, disposal well locations or otherwise, or requiring them to
shut down disposal wells, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

30 

Continuing political and
social discussion of the issue of climate change has resulted in legislative, regulatory and other initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, such as carbon dioxide and methane. Policy makers at both the U.S. federal and state levels have introduced legislation and
proposed new regulations designed to quantify and limit the emission of greenhouse gases through inventories, limitations and/or taxes
on GHG emissions. The EPA has issued regulations for the control of methane emissions, which also include leak detection and repair requirements,
for the oil and gas industry and are likely to create additional regulations regarding such matters. In November 15, 2021, the EPA proposed
new regulations to establish comprehensive standards of performance and emission guidelines for methane and volatile organic compound
emissions from new and existing operations in the oil and gas sector, including the exploration and production, transmission, processing,
and storage segments. EPA hopes to finalize the proposed regulations by the end of 2022. Once finalized, the regulations are likely to
be subject to legal challenge, and will also need to be incorporated into the states implementation plans, which will need to be
approved by the EPA in individual rulemakings that could also be subject to legal challenge. As a result, we cannot predict the scope
of any final methane regulatory requirements or the cost to our operations. 

The Inflation Reduction Act
of 2022 (the IRA ), which was signed into law in August 2022, imposes an escalating charge on methane emissions from inter
alia onshore petroleum and natural gas production, and natural gas processing, gathering, transmission, underground storage, and LNG storage/
import/export equipment. The charges apply only to facilities emitting 25,000 metric tons of CO2 annually The IRA also funds grants to
facilities subject to the methane charge and marginal conventional wells to improve equipment and processes. The IRA also
creates generous tax credits, benefitting even non-profit entities, that likely will create more supply and demand for alternative non-hydrocarbon
energy which may diminish demand, or prices obtained, for natural gas and oil. These statutory provisions will also be subject to legal
challenge. The cumulative effect upon our business results of the IRA s grants, charges, and incentives to non-hydrocarbon
energy assets and fuels, is uncertain. 

Future additional federal
GHG regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a significant possibility. Some states have imposed limitations designed to reduce
methane emissions from oil and gas exploration and production activities. Legislative and state initiatives to date have generally focused
on the development of renewable energy standards and/or cap-and-trade and/or carbon tax programs. Renewable energy standards (also referred
to as renewable portfolio standards) require electric utilities to provide a specified minimum percentage of electricity from eligible
renewable resources, with potential increases to the required percentage over time. The development of a federal renewable energy standard,
or the development of additional or more stringent renewable energy standards at the state level, or continuing implementation of increasingly
disadvantageous (from our industry s perspective) renewable energy requirements embedded in existing legislation could reduce the
demand for oil and gas, thereby adversely impacting our earnings, cash flows and financial position. A cap-and-trade program generally
would cap overall greenhouse gas emissions on an economy-wide basis and require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions or major fuel
producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances. A federal cap and trade program or expanded use of cap and trade programs at the
state level could impose direct costs on us through the purchase of allowances and could impose indirect costs by incentivizing consumers
to shift away from fossil fuels. In addition, federal or state carbon taxes could directly increase our costs of operation and similarly
incentivize consumers to shift away from fossil fuels. 

In addition, opponents of
fossil fuels claiming concern about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel
energy companies, which has resulted in an increasing number of financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting
or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this would make it more difficult and expensive to secure
funding for exploration and production activities. Members of the investment community have also begun to screen companies such as ours
for sustainability performance, including practices related to GHGs and climate change, before investing in our securities. Any efforts
to improve our sustainability practices in response to these pressures may increase our costs, and we may be forced to implement technologies
that are not economically viable in order to improve our sustainability performance and to meet the specific requirements to perform services
for certain customers. 

These various legislative,
regulatory and other activities addressing greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect our business, including by imposing reporting
obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, our equipment and operations, which could require us to incur costs to
reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations. Limitations on GHG emissions could also adversely affect demand for oil and gas,
which could lower the value of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and liquidity. 

31 

Some of our properties
are in areas that may have been partially depleted or drained by offset wells and certain of our wells may be adversely affected by actions
we or other operators may take when drilling, completing, or operating wells that we or they own. 

Some of our properties are
in reservoirs that may have already been partially depleted or drained by earlier offset drilling. The owners of leasehold interests adjoining
any of our properties could take actions, such as drilling and completing additional wells, which could adversely affect our operations.
When a new well is completed and produced, the pressure differential in the vicinity of the well causes the migration of reservoir fluids
toward the new wellbore (and potentially away from existing wellbores). As a result, the drilling and production of these potential locations
by us or other operators could cause depletion of our proved reserves and may inhibit our ability to further develop our proved reserves.
In addition, completion operations and other activities conducted on adjacent or nearby wells by us or other operators could cause production
from our wells to be shut in for indefinite periods of time, could result in increased lease operating expenses and could adversely affect
the production and reserves from our wells after they re-commence production. We have no control over the operations or activities of
offsetting operators. 

Risks Related to our Common Shares 

The market price of
our securities is volatile and may not accurately reflect the long term value of our Company. 

Securities markets have a
high level of price and volume volatility, and the market price of securities of many companies has experienced substantial volatility
in the past. This volatility may affect the ability of holders of our securities to sell their securities at an advantageous price. Market
price fluctuations in our securities may be due to our operating results, failing to meet expectations of securities analysts or investors
in any period, downward revision in securities analysts estimates, adverse changes in general market conditions or economic trends,
acquisitions, dispositions, or other material public announcements by us or our competitors, along with a variety of additional factors.
These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our securities. Financial markets have historically, at times,
experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of companies
and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance, underlying asset values, or prospects of such companies. 

Accordingly, the market
price of our securities may decline even if our operating results, underlying asset values, or prospects have not changed. Additionally,
these factors as well as other related factors may cause decreases in asset values that are deemed to be other than temporary, which
may result in impairment losses. There can be no assurance that continuing fluctuations in the price and volume of our securities will
not occur. If such increased levels of volatility and market turmoil continue, our operations could be adversely impacted and the trading
price of our securities may be materially adversely affected. 

Following
our reverse stock split, the resulting market price of our Common shares may not attract new investors, including institutional investors,
and may not satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. Consequently, the trading liquidity of our common shares may not improve . 

Although
we believe that a higher market price of our common shares may help generate greater or broader investor interest, there can be no assurance
that our reverse stock split completed on November 2, 2022, will result in a share price that will attract new investors, including institutional
investors. In addition, there can be no assurance that the market price of our common shares will satisfy the investing requirements
of those investors. As a result, the trading liquidity of our common shares may not necessarily improve. 

We have never paid cash dividends and have no
plans to pay cash dividends in the future. 

Holders of our common shares are entitled to receive
such dividends as may be declared by our board of directors. To date, we have paid no cash dividends on our capital stock and we do not
expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain future earnings, if any, to provide funds for operations of
our business. Therefore, any return investors in our capital stock may have will be in the form of appreciation, if any, in the market
value of their common shares. 

We may need to raise additional funds to support
our business operations or to finance future acquisitions, including through the issuance of equity or debt securities, which could have
a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business, and may dilute your ownership in us. 

If we do not generate sufficient cash from operations
or do not otherwise have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to support our business operations or to finance future acquisitions, we
may need raise addition capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities. We do not have any arrangements for any credit facility,
or any other sources of capital. We may not be able to raise cash in future financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all. 

Financings, if available, may be on terms that are
dilutive to our shareholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the
current price of our common shares. The holders of new securities may also receive rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to
those of existing holders of our Common shares. If new sources of financing are required but are insufficient or unavailable, we would
be required to modify our plans to the extent of available funding, which could harm our ability to grow our business. 

32 

We have issued options, warrants and a convertible
debenture and may continue to issue additional securities in the future. The exercise and/or conversion of these securities and the sale
of the common shares issuable thereunder may dilute your percentage ownership interest and may also result in downward pressure on the
price of our Common shares. 

As of February 10, 2023, we have issued and
outstanding options to purchase 84,583 common shares with a weighted average exercise price of 13.26 per share and warrants to
purchase 1,097,096 common shares with a weighted average exercise price of 12.12 per share. In addition, we have 107,777 common
shares available for future issuance under our 2017 and 2022 Stock Option Plans. Because the market for our common shares may be
thinly traded, the sales and/or the perception that those sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common
shares. Furthermore, the mere existence of a significant number of common shares issuable upon exercise and/or conversion of our
outstanding securities may be perceived by the market as having a potential dilutive effect, which could lead to a decrease in the
price of our common shares. 

Our principal shareholders and management own
a significant percentage of our shares and may be able to exert significant control over matters subject to shareholder approval. 

Our executive officers, directors and principal shareholders
and their affiliates beneficially hold, in the aggregate, approximately 37.24 of our outstanding common shares. These shareholders, acting
together, are able to significantly influence all matters requiring shareholder approval. For example, these shareholders would be able
to significantly influence elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets,
or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common shares
that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our shareholders. 

We are a British Columbia company and it may
be difficult for you to enforce judgments against us or certain of our directors or officers. 

As a corporation organized under the provincial laws
of British Columbia, Canada, it may be difficult to bring actions under U.S. federal securities law against us. Some of our directors
and officers reside principally in Canada or outside of the United States. Because a portion of our assets and the assets of these persons
are located outside of the United States, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon
us or those persons. Furthermore, it may not be possible for investors to enforce against us, or those persons not in the United States,
judgments obtained in U.S. courts based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws or other laws of the United
States. There is doubt as to the enforceability, in original actions in Canadian courts, of liabilities based upon U.S. federal securities
laws and as to the enforceability in Canadian courts of judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions based upon the civil liability provisions
of the U.S. federal securities laws. Therefore, it may not be possible to enforce those actions against us or certain of our directors
and officers. 

If securities or industry analysts do not publish
research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline. 

The trading market for our common shares will depend
in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Securities and industry analysts
may never publish research on our Company. If no securities or industry analysts cover our Company, the trading price for our common shares
would likely be negatively impacted. In the event securities or industry analysts cover our Company, if one or more of the analysts who
covers us downgrades our shares or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price may decline. If one
or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our Company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our shares could decrease,
which might cause our share price and trading volume to decline. 

General Risk Factors 

We are an emerging
growth company and a smaller reporting company and will be able to avail ourselves of reduced disclosure requirements
applicable to emerging growth companies and/or smaller reporting companies, which could make our securities less attractive to investors. 

We are an emerging
growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements
that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including not being required to comply
with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive
compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote
on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107
of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided
in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging
growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an
 emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues
of 1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial
public offering; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or
(iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC. 

33 

In
addition, even if we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still take advantage of certain reduced reporting
requirements as a smaller reporting company. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging
growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies.
Specifically, as a smaller reporting company, we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, and, similar to emerging growth
companies, if we are a smaller reporting company, we may not be required to obtain an attestation report on internal control over financial
reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. 

We cannot predict if investors
will find our securities attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as
a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and our share price may be more volatile. 

Failure to maintain
effective internal control over our financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could cause our financial
reports to be inaccurate. 

We are required pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to assess and report on the effectiveness
of those controls. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control
over financial reporting. Although we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States, our internal accounting controls may not meet all standards applicable to companies with publicly traded securities.
If we fail to implement any required improvements to our disclosure controls and procedures, we may be obligated to report control deficiencies
in which case, we could become subject to regulatory sanction or investigation. Further, these outcomes could damage investor confidence
in the accuracy and reliability of our financial statements. 

Financial reporting obligations of being a public
company in the U.S. are expensive and time-consuming, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance matters. 

As a publicly traded company we incur significant
legal, accounting and other expenses. The obligations of being a public company in the U.S. requires significant expenditures and may
place significant demands on our management and other personnel, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations regarding corporate governance practices, including those under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the listing requirements of the stock exchange on which our securities
are listed. These rules require the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and procedures, internal
control over financial reporting and changes in corporate governance practices, among many other complex rules that are often difficult
to implement, monitor and maintain compliance with. Moreover, despite recent reforms made possible by the JOBS Act, the reporting requirements,
rules, and regulations will make some activities more time-consuming and costly, particularly after we are no longer an emerging
growth company or a smaller reporting company. In addition, these rules and regulations may make it more difficult
and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a
substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of these requirements and to keep pace with new regulations, otherwise we
may fall out of compliance and risk becoming subject to litigation or being delisted, among other potential problems.

Reserve engineering is a method of estimating underground
accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality
of available data, the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made by reserve engineers. In addition, the results
of drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of previous estimates. If significant, such revisions would change
the schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates may differ significantly from the quantities
of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered.

as all indications from the drilling show to be favorable as multiple zones have been found which allows us to proceed with the next steps
of perforation and completion. 

Impact of Covid-19 

In March 2020 the World Health Organization declared
coronavirus COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak, which has continued to spread, and any related adverse public
health developments, has adversely affected workforces, economies, and financial markets globally, potentially leading to an economic
downturn. Specifically, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including travel bans, prohibitions on group events and gatherings, shutdowns
of certain businesses, curfews, shelter-in-place orders and recommendations to practice social distancing in addition to other actions
taken by both businesses and governments, resulted in a significant and swift reduction in international and U.S. economic activity. The
collapse in the demand for oil caused by this unprecedented global health and economic crisis contributed to the significant decrease
in crude oil prices in 2020 in general and resulted in shut down of the Company s wellbores which had and could in the future continue
to have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. As a result of the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic, the Company s operations, and those of its operating partners, have and may continue to experience delays or disruptions
and temporary suspensions of operations and increased volatility. In addition, the Company s results of operations and financial
condition have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; however, it is not possible for the Company
to predict the duration or magnitude of the adverse results of the outbreak and its effects on the Company s business or ability
to raise funds at this time. The Company is closely monitoring developments and adapting its business plans accordingly. 

JOBS Act 

On April 5, 2012, the JOBS
Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other
words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. 

We have chosen to take advantage
of the extended transition periods available to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act for complying with new or revised accounting
standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies provided under the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements
may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates for complying with new or revised accounting
standards. 

Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS
Act, as an emerging growth company, we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions, including, without limitation, (i)
providing an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b)
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit
and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an emerging growth company until
the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of 1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last
day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our initial public offering; (iii) the date on which we have issued
more than 1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated
filer under the rules of the SEC. 

Selected Annual Information

Factors That Affect the Comparability of the Annual
Financial Data Disclosed Above 

Net losses for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were mainly
attributable to operating expenses (2022 - 3,778,693, 2021 - 1,324,361) and other income/expense (2022 - income of 185,618, 2021 -
expense of 13,506), partially offset by revenue from oil and gas sales and royalty income (2022 - 878,459, 2021 - 84,625). The increase
in total assets in fiscal 2022 is due to net proceeds of 7,044,472 raised from private placement financings. The change in non-current
liabilities in fiscal 2022 is mainly due to the changes in estimates on asset retirement obligations.

During the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company reported a net loss
of 2,714,616 as compared to a net loss of 1,253,242 for the year ended September 30, 2021. The net loss for fiscal 2022 was mainly attributable
to operating expenses of 3,778,693 compared to operating expenses of 1,324,361 in fiscal 2021, being partially offset by revenue from
oil and gas sales and royalty income of 878,459 in fiscal 2022 compared to 84,625 in fiscal 2021. 

The Company reported oil and gas sales revenue of
 815,391 in fiscal 2022 compared with revenue of 46,703 in 2021. The increase was mainly due to revenue generated from sales of oil and
gas extracted from our Breedlove B Clearfork properties that were acquired at the end of fiscal 2021, which accounted for
70 of the Company s oil and gas sales in the current year. The Company also brought Pittcock North, Mary Bullard, and West Henshaw
wells back online during the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Net oil-equivalent production by final product sold in fiscal 2022 average
34.51 barrels per day, compared with 3.24 barrels per day in fiscal 2021. 

The production expenses for fiscal 2022 were 829,194
compared with 59,671 in fiscal 2021. The increase was mostly due to the increase in production in 2022 compared to 2021 combined with
increased maintenance expenses related to bringing the West Henshaw wells back online in 2022. 

The general and administrative expenses excluding
share-based payment expenses for fiscal 2022 were 2,250,060, compared with 493,511 in fiscal 2021. This increase in 2022 from 2021 was
mainly due to the increase in capital raising and marketing activities during 2022. Specifically, the variance in 2022 from 2021 was mainly
attributable to: 

Accounting and audit fees of 240,286 (2021 - 78,090), which increased in 2022 from 2021 mostly due to increased production activities and the increased regulatory compliance work in the United States related to the filing of the Form S-1 (the Registration Statement with the SEC. 

Consulting fees of 241,421 (2021 - 18,394), which related to fees to contract consultants for geological, project management, and general regulatory and corporate consulting work. The increase in 2022 from 2021 was mostly due to the increase in field and corporate activities in fiscal 2022. 

Legal fees of 351,975 (2021 - 14,803), which increased in 2022 from 2021 mostly due to the work related to the preparation of the Registration Statement and the increased regulatory compliance requirements in the United States in connection with the Company becoming required to file periodic and current reports under Exchange Act in 2022 

Management fees of 229,901 (2021 - 149,806), which related to fees paid to the Company s Chief Executive Officer CEO ). The Company had an employment contract with the Company s Chief Executive Officer for an annual base salary of 150,000 in fiscal 2021. Effective October 1, 2021, the annual base salary increased to 200,000. Effective May 1, 2022, the annual base salary increased to 250,000. 

Marketing and promotion expenses of 607,207 (2021 - 27,251), which mainly included costs of marketing firms for investor awareness programs and promotion campaigns. 

Office and general of 175,043 (2021 - 32,203), which have increased in 2022 from 2021 mostly due to the increase in corporate activities in general. 

Depreciation and depletion expenses (2022 - 105,503,
2021 - 60,479) increased in fiscal 2022 from 2021 primarily due to Breedlove acquisition at the end of fiscal 2021 and increased production. 

The Company also incurred share-based compensation
expenses of 546,335 in fiscal 2022 compared to 2,870 in fiscal 2021, mostly as a result of the Company granting 3,300,000 stock options
to the Company s directors and consultants in October 2021. Share-based compensation expenses are a non-cash charge that are the
estimated fair value of the stock options granted and vested during the period. The Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model
for the fair value calculation.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As at September 30, 2022, the Company had a cash balance of 3,300,495,
an increase of 3,274,689 from the cash balance of 25,806 on September 30, 2021. During the year ended September 30, 2022, cash used
in operating activities was 2,024,023. The Company invested 1,685,999 in capital expenditures on its oil and gas assets in fiscal 2022,
compared to 265,717 invested in fiscal 2021. Financing activities provided the Company with cash of 6,984,711 mostly as a result of
the Company receiving net proceeds of 7,044,472 from private placement financings, being partially offset by the repayment of a loan
using 23,600 of cash. 

The Company had a working capital of 2,051,127 as
at September 30, 2022 compared to a working capital deficiency of 465,129 as at September 30, 2021. 

Although the Company expects to invest additional
capital on the continued development of its oil and gas operations, the Company currently does not have material commitments for capital
expenditures. As of both September 30, 2022 and the date of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022, the
Company believes it has sufficient working capital to meet its anticipated operating and capital requirements over the next 12 months.
The Company will continue to monitor the current economic and financial market conditions and evaluate their impact on the Company s
liquidity and future prospects. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in accordance
with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Management evaluates these estimates
and judgments on an ongoing basis and bases its estimates on experience, current and expected future conditions, third-party evaluations
and various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. 

Significant estimates have been used by management
in conjunction with the following: (i) petroleum and natural gas reserves; (ii) the fair value of assets when determining the existence
of impairment factors and the amount of impairment, if any; (iii) the costs of site restoration when determining asset retirement obligations;
(iv) income taxes receivable or payable; (v) the useful lives of assets for the purposes of depreciation; (vi) general credit risk associated
with receivables and other assets; and (vii) share-based payments. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis
using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, and makes adjustments when facts and circumstances
dictate. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; therefore, actual results could
differ from those estimates.

under the laws of British Columbia, Canada and maintains its head office at Suite 925, 2911 Turtle Creek Blvd, Dallas, Texas, 75219. Its
registered office is located at 10 th floor, 595 Howe Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6C 2T5. The Company is primarily
engaged in the acquisition, development and production of oil and gas properties in the United States. The Company s oil and gas
interests are located in Texas and New Mexico, USA. The Company is listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange (the CSE under the symbol OIL and on the OTCQB under the symbol OILCF . 

On October 26, 2022, the
Company s board of directors approved a reverse stock split of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock at a 1
for 60 ratio, which was effective November 2, 2022. The par value and authorized shares of common stock were not adjusted as a
result of the reverse stock split. All issued and outstanding common stock, options, and warrants to purchase common stock and per
share amounts contained in the financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split for all
periods presented. 

and has not yet achieved profitable operations. The Company has been relying on equity
financing and loans from related parties to fund its operation in the past. While the Company has been successful in securing financing
to date, there can be no assurances that it will be able to do so in the future. The aforementioned factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. 

Management plans to fund operations of
the Company with its current working capital and through increasing productions from its oil and gas leases. The Company also expects
to raise additional funds through equity financings. There are no written agreements in place for such funding or issuance of securities
and there can be no assurance that such will be available in the future. Management believes that this plan provides an opportunity for
the Company to continue as a going concern. 

In view of these matters, continuation
as a going concern is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn is dependent upon the Company s ability
to, meets its financial requirements, raise additional capital, and the success of its future operations. The financial statements do
not include any adjustments to the amount and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should the Company not continue
as a going concern.

Proved oil and natural gas properties
are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted, future net cash flows. Events
that can trigger assessments for possible impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant decreases
in the market value of an asset (including changes to the commodity price forecast or carbon costs), significant change in the extent
or manner of use of or a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or asset group will
be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life. Impaired assets are written
down to their estimated fair values, generally their discounted, future net cash flows. For proved oil and natural gas properties, the
Company performs impairment reviews on a field basis, annually or as appropriate. 

Other corporate property and equipment
consist primarily of leasehold improvements, vehicle, and office furniture and equipment and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The capitalized costs are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to . 

For property dispositions, measurement
is at fair value, unless the transaction lacks commercial substance or fair value cannot be reliably measured. Where the exchange is measured
at fair value, a gain or loss is recognized in net income. Any deferred consideration recorded on property dispositions are recognized
as revenue in the statement of loss and comprehensive loss over the reserve life. 

Gains or losses are recorded for sales
or dispositions of oil and gas properties which constitute an entire common operating field or which result in a significant alteration
of the common operating field s depletion rate. These gains and losses are classified as asset dispositions in the accompanying
consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss. Partial common operating field sales or dispositions deemed not to significantly
alter the depletion rates are generally accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized. 

impairment charge has been recorded.

Proved
Reserves 

The
Company s proved oil and natural gas reserves have been estimated by the certified independent engineering firm, MKM Engineering.
Proved reserves are the estimated quantities that geologic and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable
in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed reserves are the quantities
expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods when the estimates were made. Due to the
inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes
available. The reserves actually recovered and the timing of production of these reserves may be substantially different from the original
estimate. Revisions result primarily from new information obtained from development drilling and production history; acquisitions of
oil and natural gas properties; and changes in economic factors.

Standardized
Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves 

The
following information is based on the Company s best estimate of the required data for the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future
Net Cash Flows as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 in accordance with ASC 932, Extractive Activities Oil and
Gas which requires the use of a 10 discount rate. This information is not the fair market value, nor does it represent the expected
present value of future cash flows of the Company s proved oil and gas reserves. 

Future
cash inflows for the years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 were estimated as specified by the SEC through calculation
of an average price based on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the period from October
through September during each respective fiscal year. The resulting net cash flow are reduced to present value by applying a 10 discount
factor.

be incurred in developing and producing the Company s proved crude oil and natural gas reserves at the end of the year, based on
year-end costs, and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions.

9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

On
October 31, 2022, Davidson Company LLP Davidson resigned as the Company s independent registered public accounting
firm effective October 31, 2022. 

Davidson
audited the Company s consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. The report
of Davidson on the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, did not contain any adverse
opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. 

During
the Company s fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, and through the interim period ended October 31, 2022, there were
no disagreements between the Company and Davidson on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure,
or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Davidson, would have caused Davidson to make
reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its audit reports on the Company s financial statements.
During the Company s two most recent fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the subsequent interim periods, Davidson
did not advise the Company of any reportable events specified in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K with respect to the Company. 

The Company provided Davidson
with a copy of the Company s current report on Form 8-K in accordance with Item 304(a) of Regulation S-K prior to the filing of
such report with the Securities and Exchange Commission and requested that Davidson furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees
with the above statements and, if it does not agree, the respects in which it does not agree. A copy of the letter from Davidson is included
as Exhibit 16.1 to this Annual Report. 

Engagement of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

On
October 31, 2022, through and with the approval of its Audit Committee, the Company appointed Marcum LLP Marcum as its
independent registered public accounting firm. During the Company s two most recently completed fiscal years and the subsequent
interim periods through the date of engagement of Marcum, neither the Company nor anyone on behalf of the Company consulted with Marcum
regarding (a) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit
opinion that might be rendered on the Company s financial statements nor has Marcum provided to us with a written report or oral
advice that was an important factor in reaching a decision on any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (b) any matter
that was the subject of a disagreement or a reportable event as defined in Items 304(a)(1)(iv) and (v) of Regulation S-K. 

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We
carried out an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-5(e) under the Exchange Act) pursuant to
paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-5 under the Exchange Act. Based on that review, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure
controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit
under the Exchange Act (1) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

The
following control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting: 

Insufficient
 resources resulting in inadequate segregation of duties in certain accounting functions, the processing and approval of transactions,
 due to the size of the accounting department. 

Lack of knowledge of US
 GAAP and ineffective controls associated with the conversion from IFRS to US GAAP 

Ineffective controls over
 inputs used in the valuation of the Asset Retirement Obligation 

Ineffective controls on
 the accounting and the valuation of complex financial instruments 

Ineffective review of the
 financial statements due to the limited financial and reporting resources 

Ineffective information
 technology general controls in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain information technology systems
 that support the Company s financial reporting processes.

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The
Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company s
financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under
the Exchange Act and includes those policies and procedures that: (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company s assets; (b) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that the Company s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company s
management and directors; and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. All internal
controls, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide
only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 

The
Company s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of
September 30, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on this
assessment, management has concluded that, as of September 30, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was
not effective, due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the Company s fourth fiscal quarter that our certifying officers concluded materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

of a stock option plan, plan providing for the grant of stock appreciation rights, deferred share units or restricted stock units or
any other incentive plan or portion of a plan under which awards are granted. 

The

shareholders on April 8, 2022. The purpose of the Option Plan is to ensure that the Company is to able to provide an incentive program
for directors, officers, employees and persons providing services to the Company (each, an Optionee that provides enough
flexibility in the structuring of incentive benefits to allow the Company to remain competitive in the recruitment and maintenance of
key personnel. 

The
Option Plan will be administered by the Board or the compensation committee of the Company, as applicable, which shall, without limitation,
have full and final authority in its discretion, but subject to the express provisions of the Option Plan, to interpret the Option Plan,
to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to it and to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable
for the administration of the Option Plan, subject to any necessary shareholder or regulatory approval. The Board may delegate any or
all of its authority with respect to the administration of the Option Plan. The Board shall determine to whom options shall be granted,
the terms and provisions of the respective option agreements, the time or times at which such options shall be granted and vested, and
the number of common shares to be subject to each option. 

Under
the Option Plan, options will be exercisable over periods of up to 10 years as determined by the Board. The exercise price of any option
may not be less than the greater of the closing market price of the common shares on: (i) the trading day prior to the date of grant
of the option; and (ii) the grant date of the option, less any applicable discount allowed by the Canadian Securities Exchange (the CSE or any other stock exchange on which the common shares are listed for trading. 

48 

The
maximum number of common shares which may be issued pursuant to options granted under the Option Plan is 10 of the issued and outstanding
common shares at the time of the grant, provided that the common shares are listed on the CSE or any other stock exchange at the time
of grant. In addition, the number of common shares which may be issuable under the Option Plan and all of the Company s other previously
established or proposed share compensation arrangements, within a one-year period: 

to
 any one Optionee may not exceed (without the requisite disinterested shareholder approval) 5 of the issued common shares on a non-diluted
 basis;

 the time of the grant; and 

to
 all Optionees who undertake investor relation activities shall not exceed 1 in the aggregate of the total number of issued and outstanding
 common shares at the time of the grant, on a non-diluted basis. 

The
Option Plan permits the Board to specify a vesting schedule in its discretion, subject to minimum vesting requirements imposed by the
applicable stock exchange. Unless otherwise specified by the Board at the time of granting an option, and subject to the other limits
on option grants set out in the Option Plan, all options granted under the Option Plan shall vest and become exercisable in full upon
grant, except Options granted to consultants performing investor relations activities, which options must vest in stages over twelve
months with no more than one-quarter of the options vesting in any three month period. 

The

bid, all common shares subject to options shall immediately become vested and may thereupon be exercised in whole or in part by the option
holder. The Board may also accelerate the expiry date of outstanding options in connection with a take-over bid. 

The
Option Plan contains adjustment provisions with respect to outstanding options in cases of share reorganizations, special distributions
and other corporation reorganizations including an arrangement or other transaction under which the business or assets of the Company
become, collectively, the business and assets of two or more companies with the same shareholder group upon the distribution to the Company s
shareholders, or the exchange with the Company s shareholders, of securities of the Company or securities of another company. 

The
Option Plan provides that on the death or disability of an option holder, all vested options will expire at the earlier of 365 days after
the date of death or disability and the expiry date of such options. Where an Optionee is terminated for cause, any outstanding options
(whether vested or unvested) are cancelled as of the date of termination. If an Optionee retires or voluntarily resigns or is otherwise
terminated by the Company other than for cause, then all vested options held by such Optionee will expire at the earlier of (i) the expiry
date of such options and (ii) the date which is 90 days (30 days if the Optionee was engaged in investor relations activities) after
the Optionee ceases its office, employment or engagement with the Company. 

The
Option Plan contains a provision that if pursuant to the operation of an adjustment provision of the Option Plan, an Optionee receives
options (the New Options to purchase securities of another company (the New Company in respect of the Optionee s
options under the Option Plan (the Subject Options ), the New Options shall expire on the earlier of: (i) the expiry date
of the Subject Options; (ii) if the Optionee does not become an eligible person in respect of the New Company, the date that the Subject
Options expire pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Option Plan relating to expiration of options in cases of death, disability
or termination of employment discussed in the preceding paragraph above (the Termination Provisions (iii) if the Optionee
becomes an eligible person in respect of the New Company, the date that the New Options expire pursuant to the terms of the New Company s
stock option plan that correspond to the Termination Provisions; and (iv) the date that is one year after the Optionee ceases to be an
eligible person in respect of the New Company or such shorter period as determined by the Board. 

In
accordance with good corporate governance practices and as recommended by National Policy 51-201 Disclosure Standards ,
the Company imposes black-out periods restricting the trading of its securities by directors, officers, employees and consultants during
periods surrounding the release of annual and interim financial statements and at other times when deemed necessary by management and
the Board. In order to ensure that holders of outstanding options are not prejudiced by the imposition of such black-out periods, the
Option Plan contains a provision to the effect that any outstanding options with an expiry date occurring during a management imposed
black-out period or within five trading days thereafter will be automatically extended to a date that is 10 trading days following the
end of the black-out period. 

49 

The
options granted under the Option Plan are non-assignable and non-transferable. Subject to required shareholder approval and the approval
of the CSE, or any other stock exchange on which the common shares are listed, if applicable, the Board may from time to time amend or
revise the terms of the Option Plan or may terminate the Option Plan at any time. 

The
Company does not provide any financial assistance to participants in order to facilitate the purchase of common shares under the Option
Plan. As at February 9, 2023, there were options outstanding under the Option Plan to acquire 84,583 common shares, representing approximately
4 of the Company s current issued and outstanding shares.

head office of the Company, 2911 Turtle Creek Blvd, Suite 925, Dallas, Texas 75219, during normal business hours and at the Meeting. In addition, a copy
of the Option Plan will be mailed, free of charge, to any shareholder who requests a copy, in writing, from the Chief Financial Officer
of the Company. Any such requests should be mailed to the Company, at its head office, to the attention of the Chief Financial Officer. 

Employment,
Consulting and Management Agreements 

Other
than the executive employment agreement between the Company and Mehran Ehsan, the material terms of which are set forth below, the Company
does not have any compensation agreements or arrangements that the Company or any of its subsidiaries have entered into with respect
to services provided by a NEO, a director or any other party in the event such services provided are typically provided by a director
or NEO (collectively, Compensation Arrangements ). 

The
Compensation Arrangements for Mehran Ehsan were initially set forth in the amended employment agreement dated September 1, 2021, as subsequently
amended on May 1, 2022, between the Company and Mr. Ehsan (the CEO Employment Agreement ). Pursuant to the CEO Employment
Agreement, the Company employs Mr. Ehsan to serve as CEO of the Company and to perform such duties and have such authority as may from
time to time be assigned by the Board. As compensation for the performance of such duties, the Company paid Mr. Ehsan a base salary of
 200,000 per year (which increased to 250,000 as of May 1, 2022), which shall be reviewed by the Company annually. Mr. Ehsan is also
eligible for cash bonuses and grants of Options under the Option Plan, in the sole discretion of the Board, as well as group health,
medical and disability insurance benefits and any other fringe benefit programs that the Company maintains from time to time for the
benefit of its employees. 

The
Company may immediately terminate Mr. Ehsan s employment at any time for cause, by written notice. The Company may terminate the
Mr. Ehsan s employment at any time without cause by providing him with notice in writing and compensation in lieu of notice as
follows: 

payment
 of all outstanding and accrued base salary and vacation pay, earned and owing up to the last day of the active employment, and reimbursement
 for all proper expenses incurred by him in connection with the Company s business prior to the last day of active employment; 

payment
 of an amount equal to 36 months base salary; 

payment
 of an amount in lieu of his performance bonus equal to 20 of base salary; and 

continuation
 of his benefit coverage for a period of six months, or alternatively, if it is unable to continue Mr. Ehsan s participation
 in one or more of the Company s benefit plans, the Company shall pay him an amount equal to the premium cost or contributions
 the Company would otherwise have made in respect of his participation in the relevant plan(s) for six months. 

Mr.
Ehsan is required to give the Company not less than two weeks notice in the event of his resignation. Upon receipt of his notice
of resignation, or at any time thereafter, the Company has the right to elect to pay, in lieu of such notice period, Mr. Ehsan s
salary for the remainder of the notice period and a reasonable amount in lieu of the his benefits for that period. If the Company elects
for payment in lieu of notice, the Mr. Ehsan s employment shall terminate immediately upon such payment. 

If
the Company determines that Mr. Ehsan has suffered a Disability (as defined below) that cannot be accommodated, the Company may terminate
his employment by notice. In such case, Mr. Ehsan is entitled to receive, in lieu of all amounts otherwise payable under the CEO Employment
Agreement (except for amounts earned but not yet paid to Mr. Ehsan through the date of such Disability), compensation at Mr. Ehsan s
base salary rate for a period of six months following the date of Disability or such greater amount as is required by applicable law.
In the CEO Employment Agreement, Disability means a physical or mental incapacity of Mr. Ehsan that has prevented him from
performing the duties customarily assigned to him for 180 days, whether or not consecutive, out of any 12 consecutive months and that
in the opinion of the Company, acting on the basis of advice from a duly qualified medical practitioner, is likely to continue to a similar
degree. 

50 

In
the event of death, Mr. Ehsan s employment shall be deemed to have terminated on the date thereof and the Company shall pay his
estate the amounts specified above in respect of termination without cause. 

Other
than pursuant to the CEO Employment Agreement, the Company has not granted any termination or change of control benefits with respect
to any Compensation Arrangement and there are no compensatory plans or arrangements with respect to any NEO or director resulting from
the resignation, retirement or any other termination of any NEO or director or from a change of any NEO s or director s responsibilities
following a change of control. In case of termination of NEOs, other than the CEO, common law and statutory law applies. 

The
table below sets forth information with respect to each NEO currently employed by the Company in order to assist the reader in determining
the potential payment to each such NEO in the event of the termination of such NEO s employment by the Company other than for cause
or in the event of a change of control. The estimated payments have been calculated on the basis of employment agreements as they exist
at the date of this Annual Report and assuming that they were in effect on September 30, 2022.

The
estimated payments assuming a change of control on September 30, 2022 are based on the assumption that the NEOs are terminated without
cause or elect to terminate the agreements. 

Oversight
and Description of Director and Name Executive Officer Compensation 

Elements
of Compensation 

Compensation
to be awarded or paid to the Company s directors and/or executive officers, including NEOs consist primarily of management fees,
stock options and bonuses. Payments may be made from time to time to executive officers, including NEOs, or companies they control for
the provision of consulting or management services. Such services are paid for by the Company at competitive industry rates for work
of a similar nature done by reputable arm s length services providers. 

The
Board will from time to time determine the stock option grants to be made pursuant to the Option Plan. It is also anticipated that the
Board may award bonuses, in its sole discretion, to executive officers (including NEOs) from time to time. 

The
most significant components of the Company s executive compensation plan are base salary and an annual incentive bonus. These components
are based upon: 

achievement
 of specific corporate or segment performance targets; 

a
 performance evaluation process, taking into consideration comparative levels of compensation with comparable entities in the Company s
 industry; 

alignment
 of the compensation level of each individual to that individual s level of responsibility; 

the
 individual s performance, competencies, skills and achievements; 

alignment
 with corporate strategy; and 

contributions
 to corporate or segment performance. 

51 

Base
Salary 

The
base salary review of any NEO will take into consideration the current competitive market conditions, experience, proven or expected
performance, and the particular skills of the NEO. Base salary is not expected to be evaluated against a formal peer group .
The base salaries for NEOs during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 were set at the following: 

Mehran
 Ehsan (CEO) 150,000/year commencing in 2017, subject to adjustment. During the year ended September 30, 2021, Mr. Ehsan received
 149,806. Mr. Mehran s annual salary was increased to 200,000 October 1, 2021 and further increased to 250,000 effective
 as of May 1, 2022. During the year ended September 30, 2022, Mr. Ehsan received 220,834. 

Performance-Based
Cash Bonuses 

Cash
bonuses are not a normal part of the Company s executive compensation. However, the Company may elect to utilize such incentives
where the role-related context and competitive environment suggest that such a compensation modality is appropriate. When and if utilized,
the amount of cash bonus compensation will normally be paid on the basis of timely achievement of specific pre-agreed milestones. Each
milestone will be selected based upon consideration of its impact on shareholder value creation and the ability of the Company to achieve
the milestone during a specific interval. The amount of bonus compensation will be determined based upon achievement of the milestone,
its importance to the Company s near and long term goals at the time such bonus is being considered, the bonus compensation awarded
to similarly situated executives in similarly situated companies or any other factors the Company may consider appropriate at the time
such performance-based bonuses are decided upon. 

Stock
Options 

The
Company currently has the Option Plan in place for the purposes of attracting and motivating directors, officers, employees, and consultants
of the Company and advancing the interests of the Company by affording such persons with the opportunity to acquire an equity interest
in the Company through rights granted under the Option Plan. Any grant of options under the Option Plan is within the discretion of the
Board, subject to the condition that the maximum number of common shares which may be reserved for issuance under the Option Plan may
not exceed 10 of the Company s issued and outstanding common shares. 

Options
are also an important component of aligning the objectives of the Company s employees with those of shareholders. The Company expects
to provide significant option positions to senior employees and lesser amounts to lower-level employees. 

Notwithstanding
the above, the Company is still in the development stage and has an informal compensation program and strategy. The management team is
committed to developing the operations of the Company and will establish a formal compensation program for directors and executive officers
once it begins generating revenues sufficient to sustain operations. The Board is responsible for determining, by way of discussions
at Board meetings, the ultimate compensation to be paid to the executive officers of the Company. The Company does not have a formal
compensation program with set benchmarks; however, the performance of each executive will be considered along with the Company s
ability to pay compensation and its results of operation for the period. 

The
Company relies solely on its Board to determine the executive compensation that is to be paid to NEOs and directors without any formal
objectives, criteria, or analysis. 

Pension
Disclosure 

The
Company does not currently provide any pension plan benefits for executive officers, directors, or employees.

Mr. Ehsan a base salary of 200,000 per year (which increased to 250,000 as of May 1, 2022), which shall be reviewed by the Company

Independence 

We have determined Douglas Charles Urch, John James
Lendrum, James Perry Bryan and Melissa Folz to be independent directors within the meaning of the listing standards of the

is not independent since he is the current CFO of the Company; Scott Kelly is not considered independent as he previously served as our
CFO; and Barry Whelan is not independent since he is the current COO of the Company. In making our independence determinations, we have
considered all relationships between any of the directors and the Company.

Dear
Mr. Ehsan: 

As
requested, we are submitting our estimates of proved and probable reserves and our forecasts of the resulting economics attributable
to the interests of Permex Petroleum Corporation as of September 30, 2022, in certain properties located in Eddy County, New Mexico,
Gaines, Stonewall, and Young Counties, Texas. We completed our evaluation on November 21, 2022. It is our understanding that the proved
and probable reserves estimated in this report constitute 100 of all proved and probable reserves owned by Permex Petroleum Corporation
in the United States. 

This
report has been prepared for Permex Petroleum Corporation s use in filing with the SEC; in our opinion the assumptions, data, methods,
and procedures used in the preparation of this report are appropriate for such purpose. Composite proved reserve estimates and economic

While
the oil and gas industry may be subject to regulatory changes from time to time that could affect an industry participant s ability
to recover its reserves, we are not aware of any such governmental actions which would restrict the recovery of the September 30, 2022
estimated reserves. 

Primary
Economic Assumptions 

Values
of proved and probable reserves in this report are expressed in terms of estimated future gross revenue, future net revenue, and present
worth. Future gross revenue is that revenue which will accrue to the evaluated interests from the production and sale of the estimated
net reserves. 

Future
net revenue is calculated by deducting estimated production taxes, ad valorem taxes, operating expenses, capital costs, and abandonment
costs from the future gross revenue. Operating expenses include field operating expenses, transportation expenses, compression charges,
and an allocation of overhead that directly relates to production activities. Future income tax expenses were not taken into account
in the preparation of these estimates. Present worth of future net revenue is calculated by discounting the future net revenue at the
arbitrary rate of IO percent per year compounded annually over the expected period of realization. Present worth should not be construed
as fair market value because no consideration was given to additional factors that influence the prices at which properties are bought
and sold.

Future
prices were estimated using guidelines established by the SEC and the Financial Account Standards Board (FASB). The assumptions used
for estimating future prices and expense are as follows: 

Oil
and Condensate Prices 

Oil
and condensate price differentials were calculated for each property based on prices received by Permex. The prices were calculated using
these differentials to a posted West Texas Intermediate (WTI) at Cushing of 91.71 per barrel and were held constant for the lives of
the properties. The WTI oil price of 91.71 per barrel is the 12-month average price calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average
of the first-day-of-the-month price for each of the last three months of 2021 and the first nine months of 2022. The volume-weighted
average product price over the life of the properties was 91.48 per barrel of oil. 

Gas
Prices 

Gas
price differentials were calculated for each property based on prices received by Permex. The prices were calculated using these differentials
to a Henry Hub price of 6.126 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) and were held constant for the lives of the properties. The
Henry Hub gas price of 6.126 per MMBtu is the 12-month average price calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month
price for each of the last three months of 2021 and the first nine months of 2022 British thermal unit factors were provided by Permex
and used to convert prices from dollars per MMBtu to dollars per thousand cubic feet /Md). The volume-weighted average product price
over the life of the properties was 5.98 per thousand cubic feet of gas. 

Production
and Ad Valorem taxes 

Production
taxes were calculated using the tax rates for the state in which the property is located. Ad valorem taxes were calculated using average
rates for each county in which the property is located. 

Operating
Expenses, Capital Costs and Abandonment Costs 

Operating
costs were based on operating expense records of Permex Petroleum Corporation and based on current expenses, were held constant for the
lives of the properties. Development costs were furnished to us by Permex and are based on authorization for expenditures for the proposed
work or actual costs of similar projects. The development costs furnished to us were accepted as factual data and reviewed by MKM Engineering
for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of these costs. Capital expenditures for plugging,
abandonment, and reclamation of the properties at the end-of-project life were included in this report. 

The
undeveloped reserves in this report have been incorporated herein in accordance with Permex s plans to develop these reserves as
of September 30, 2022. The implementation of Permex s development plans and budget as presented to us and incorporated herein were
approved by Permex s management. Additionally, Permex has informed MKM Engineering that they are not aware of any legal, regulatory
or political obstacles that would significantly alter the development plans.

The
proved and probable reserve classifications conform to criteria of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Reserves are judged to be
economically producible in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions and assuming continuation
of current regulatory practices using conventional production methods and equipment. In the analyses of production decline curves, reserves
were estimated only to the limit of economic rates of production under existing economic and operating conditions using prices and costs
consistent with the effective date of this report, including consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual
arrangement but not including escalations based on future conditions. The reserves and economics are predicted on the regulatory agency
classifications, rules, policies, laws, taxes, and royalties in effect on the date of this report except as noted herein. In evaluating
the information at our disposal concerning this report, we have excluded from our consideration all matters as to which the controlling
interpretation may be legal or accounting, rather than engineering and geosciences. Therefore, the possible effects of changes in legislation
or other Federal or State restrictive actions have not been considered. An on-site field inspection of these properties has not been
made nor have the wells been tested by MKM Engineering. Possible environmental liability related to the properties has not been investigated
nor considered. 

Methodology
and Procedures 

The
reserves were estimated using a combination of the production performance, volumetric, and analogy methods, in each case as we considered
to be appropriate and necessary to establish the conclusions set forth herein. All reserve estimates represent our best judgment based
on data available at the time of preparation and assumptions as to future economic and regulatory conditions. It should be realized that
the reserves actually recovered, the revenue derived therefrom, and the actual cost incurred could be more or less than the estimated
amounts. 

The
process of estimated reserves is complex. It requires significant judgments and decisions based on available geological, geophysical,
engineering, and economic data. These estimates may change substantially as additional data from ongoing development activities and production
performance becomes available and as economic conditions impacting oil and gas prices and costs change. 

For
depletion type reservoirs or those whose performance disclosed a reliable decline in producing rate trends or other diagnostic characteristics,
reserves were estimated by the application of appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships. In the analyses of production
decline curves, reserves were estimated only to the limits of economic production based on existing economic conditions. In certain cases,
when the previously named method could not be used, reserves were estimated by analogy with similar wells or reservoirs for which more
complex data were available. 

As
circumstances change and additional data become available, reserve estimates also change. 

Estimates
made are reviewed and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by the new information. Revisions are often required due to changes
in well performance, prices, economic conditions, and governmental restrictions.

Although
every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates are accurate, reserve estimation is an inferential science. As a result,
the subjective decisions, new geological or production information, and a changing environment may impact these estimates. Revisions
to reserve estimates can arise from changes in year end oil and gas prices, and reservoir performance. Such revisions can be positive
or negative. 

Gas
reserves estimated herein are expressed as sales gas. Sales gas is defined as the total gas to be produced from the reservoirs, measured
at the point of delivery, after reduction for fuel use and shrinkage resulting from the field separation and processing. Gas reserves
are expressed at a temperature base of 60 degrees Fahrenheit and at the pressure base of the state in which the resources are located.
Gas reserves included herein are expressed in thousands of cubic feet (Met). Oil and condensate reserves estimated herein are those to
be recovered by conventional lease separation. Oil and condensate reserves included in this report are expressed in barrels (bbl) representing
42 United States gallons per barrel. 

The
reserve estimates were based on interpretations of factual data furnished by Permex Petroleum Corporation. Ownership interests were supplied
by Permex Petroleum Corporation and were accepted as furnished. To some extent, information from public records has been used to check
and/or supplement this data. The basic engineering and geological data were utilized subject to third party reservations and qualifications.
Nothing has come to our attention, however, that would cause us to believe that we are not justified in relying on such data. 

MKM
Engineering is independent with respect to Permex Petroleum Corporation as provided in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and
Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers SPE Standards ). Neither
MKM 

Engineering
nor any of its employees has any interest in the subject properties. Neither the employment to make this study nor the compensation is
contingent on the results of our work or the future production rates for the subject properties. 

Our
work papers and related data are available for inspection and review by authorized parties.
