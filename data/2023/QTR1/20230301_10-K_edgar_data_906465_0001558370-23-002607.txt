In 2016, the Company elected to operate as a financial holding company under the BHCA. The Company serves the Quad Cities, Cedar Rapids, Waterloo/Cedar Falls, Des Moines/Ankeny and Springfield communities through the following four wholly-owned banking subsidiaries (collectively, the Banks ), which provide full-service commercial and consumer banking and trust and asset management services: Quad City Bank Trust (QCBT), which is based in Bettendorf, Iowa, and commenced operations in 1994; Cedar Rapids Bank Trust (CRBT), which is based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and commenced operations in 2001; Community State Bank (CSB), which is based in Ankeny, Iowa, and was acquired in 2016; and Guaranty Bank (GB), which is based in Springfield, Missouri, and was acquired in 2018.

The combined bank changed its name to Guaranty Bank. On August 12, 2020, the Company sold the Bates Companies, headquartered in Rockford, Illinois. From October 1, 2018, through the date of the disposition, the Company provided wealth management services to the Rockford community through the Bates Companies. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on mergers, acquisitions and sales. The Company engages in direct financing lease contracts and equipment financing agreements through m2, a wholly owned subsidiary of QCBT based in Brookfield, Wisconsin. Subsidiary Banks. Segments of the Company have been established by management as defined by the structure of the Company s internal organization, focusing on the financial information that the Company s operating decision-makers routinely use to make decisions about operating matters. The Company s Commercial Banking business is geographically divided by markets into the operating segments corresponding to the four subsidiary banks wholly owned by the Company: QCBT, CRBT, CSB and GB. See the Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated herein generally, and Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements specifically, for additional business segment information.

Securities issued by all of the trusts listed above mature 30 years from the date of issuance, but are all currently callable at par at any time. Interest rate reset dates vary by trust. Business. The Company s principal business consists of attracting deposits and investing those deposits in loans/leases and securities. The deposits of the subsidiary banks are insured to the maximum amount allowable by the FDIC. The Company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on its loans/leases and securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The Company s operating results are affected by economic and competitive conditions, particularly changes in interest rates, government policies and the actions of regulatory authorities, as described more fully in this Form 10-K, including in Appendix A Supervision and Regulation. Its operating results also can be affected by trust fees, investment advisory and management fees, deposit service charge fees, swap fee income/capital markets revenue, gains on the sale of residential real estate and government guaranteed loans, earnings from BOLI and other noninterest income. Operating expenses include employee compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment expense, professional and data processing fees, advertising and marketing expenses, bank service charges, FDIC and other insurance, loan/lease expenses and other administrative expenses. The Company and its subsidiaries collectively employed 973 and 726 FTEs at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in FTEs during 2022 was primarily due to the acquisition of GFED. The Federal Reserve is the primary federal regulator of the Company, QCBT, CRBT, CSB and GB. QCBT, CRBT and CSB are also regulated by the Iowa Superintendent of Banking and GB is regulated by the Missouri Division of Finance. The FDIC, as administrator of the DIF, also has regulatory authority over the subsidiary banks. See Appendix A Supervision and Regulation for more information on the federal and state statutes and regulations that are applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries. Lending/Leasing. The Company and its subsidiaries provide a broad range of commercial and retail lending/leasing and investment services to corporations, partnerships, individuals, and government agencies. The subsidiary banks actively market their services to qualified lending and deposit clients. Officers actively solicit the business of new clients entering their market areas as well as long-standing members of the local business community. The Company has an established lending/leasing policy which includes a number of underwriting factors to be considered in making a loan/lease, including, but not limited to, location, loan-to-value ratio, cash flow, collateral and the credit history of the borrower. In accordance with Iowa regulation, the legal lending limit to one borrower for QCBT, CRBT and CSB, calculated as 15 of aggregate capital, was 39.6 million, 46.3 million, and 22.2 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. In accordance with Missouri regulation, the legal lending limit to one borrower for GB, calculated as 15 of aggregate capital, totaled 36.5 million as of December 31, 2022.

 The Company recognizes the need to prevent excessive concentrations of credit exposure to any one borrower or group of related borrowers. As such, the Company has established an in-house lending limit, which is lower than each subsidiary bank s legal lending limit, in an effort to manage individual borrower exposure levels. The in-house lending limit is the maximum amount of credit each subsidiary bank will extend to a single borrowing entity or group of related entities. The Company implements a tiered approach, based on the risk rating of the borrower. Under the most recent in-house limit, total credit exposure to a single borrowing entity or group of related entities will not exceed the following, subject to certain exceptions: 

High Quality Medium Quality Low Quality (Risk Ratings 1-3) (Risk Rating 4) (Risk Ratings 5-8) (dollars in thousands) QCBT 21,500 18,000 12,500 CRBT 21,500 18,000 12,500 CSB 12,000 10,500 7,000 GB 21,500 18,000 12,500 QCRH Consolidated 32,000 25,500 15,500 The QCRH Consolidated amount represents the maximum amount of credit that all affiliated banks, when combined, will extend to a single borrowing entity or group of related entities, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, m2 s in-house lending limit is 2.5 million to a single lending/leasing entity or group of related entities, subject to certain exceptions. As part of the loan monitoring activity at the four subsidiary banks, credit administration personnel interact closely with senior bank management. For example, the internal loan committee of each subsidiary bank meets weekly. The Company has a separate in-house loan review function to analyze credits of the subsidiary banks. To complement the in-house loan review, an independent third-party performs external loan reviews. Historically, management has attempted to identify problem loans at an early stage and to aggressively seek a resolution of those situations. The Company recognizes that a diversified loan/lease portfolio contributes to reducing risk in the overall loan/lease portfolio. The specific loan/lease portfolio mix is subject to change based on loan/lease demand, the business environment and various economic factors. The Company actively monitors concentrations within the loan/lease portfolio to ensure appropriate diversification and concentration risk is maintained. Specifically, each subsidiary bank s total loans as a percentage of average assets may not exceed 85 . In addition, following are established policy limits and the actual allocations for the subsidiary banks as of December 31, 2022 for the loan portfolio organized by loan type, reflected as a percentage of the subsidiary bank s gross loans: 

QCBT CRBT CSB GB Maximum Maximum Maximum Maximum Percentage As of Percentage As of Percentage As of Percentage As of per Loan December 31, per Loan December 31, per Loan December 31, per Loan December 31, Type of Loan Policy 2022 Policy 2022 Policy 2022 Policy 2022 One-to-four family residential 30 12 25 5 35 8 30 12 Multi-family 15 15 15 20 15 13 20 14 Farmland 5 1 5 15 1 5 5 Non-farm, nonresidential 50 15 50 22 50 22 50 36 Construction and land development 20 15 15 18 35 33 15 18 C I 60 29 60 30 50 17 25 12 Loans to individuals 10 1 10 10 5 1 Lease financing 30 2 5 5 5 Bank stock loans 10 10 20 All other loans 15 10 10 5 15 6 15 2 100 100 100 100 

 The loan types above are as defined and reported in the subsidiary banks quarterly Reports of Condition and Income (also known as Call Reports). QCBT s maximum percentage for bank stock loans is 150 of risk-based capital (bank stock loan commitments are limited to 200 of risk-based capital). At December 31, 2022, QCBT s bank stock loans totaled 31 of risk-based capital. Policy limits are compared to average loan balances rather than the current balance for monitoring purposes.

Loan pricing, as established with guidance from the subsidiary banks senior management and asset/liability management committees, includes consideration for the cost of funds, loan maturity and risk, origination and maintenance costs, appropriate stockholder return, competitive factors, and the economic environment. The portfolio contains a mix of loans with fixed and floating interest rates. Management attempts to maximize the use of interest rate floors on its variable rate loan portfolio. Refer to Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for more discussion on the Company s management of interest rate risk. In an effort to manage interest rate risk, the subsidiary banks will consider entering into back-to-back interest rate swaps with select commercial borrowers. The interest rate swaps allow the commercial borrowers to pay a fixed interest rate while the banks receive a variable interest rate as well as an upfront nonrefundable fee dependent on the pricing. The banks enter an interest rate swap with the commercial borrower and an equal and offsetting interest rate swap with a larger financial institution counterparty. The Company has increased its focus on this business which has led to significantly increased noninterest income, stronger overall loan growth, and improved management of its interest rate risk. The Company will continue to review opportunities to execute these swaps at all of its subsidiary banks, as the circumstances are appropriate for the borrower and the Company. An optimal interest rate swap candidate must be of a certain size and sophistication which can lead to volatility in activity from year to year. Future levels of swap fee income can be somewhat dependent upon prevailing interest rates and other market activity. C I Lending As noted above, the subsidiary banks are active C I lenders. The current areas of emphasis include loans to small and mid-sized businesses with a wide range of operations such as wholesalers, manufacturers, building contractors, business services companies, other banks, and retailers. The subsidiary banks provide a wide range of business loans, including lines of credit for working capital and operational purposes, and term loans for the acquisition of facilities, equipment and other purposes. Since 2010, the subsidiary banks have been active in participating in lending programs offered by the SBA and USDA. Under these programs, the government entities will generally provide a guarantee of repayment ranging from 50 to 85 of the principal amount of the qualifying loan. Loan approval is generally based on the following factors: Ability and stability of current management of the borrower; Stable earnings with positive financial trends; Sufficient cash flow to support debt repayment; Earnings projections based on reasonable assumptions; Financial strength of the industry and business; and Value and marketability of collateral.

 For C I loans, the Company assigns internal risk ratings which are largely dependent upon the aforementioned approval factors. The risk rating is reviewed annually or on an as needed basis depending on the specific circumstances of the loan. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, including the internal risk rating scale. As part of the underwriting process, management reviews current borrower financial statements. When appropriate, certain C I loans may contain covenants requiring maintenance of financial performance ratios such as, but not limited to: Minimum debt service coverage ratio; Minimum current ratio; Maximum debt to tangible net worth ratio; and/or Minimum tangible net worth. 
 Establishment of these financial performance ratios depends on a number of factors, including risk rating and the specific industry in which the borrower is engaged. Collateral for these loans generally includes accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. The Company s lending policy specifies approved collateral types and corresponding maximum advance percentages. The value of collateral pledged on loans must exceed the loan amount by a margin sufficient to absorb potential erosion of its value in the event of foreclosure and cover the loan amount plus costs incurred to convert it to cash. Approved non-real estate collateral types and corresponding maximum advance percentages for each collateral type are listed below. 

Approved Collateral Type Maximum Advance Financial Instruments U.S. Government Securities 90 of market value Securities of Federal Agencies 90 of market value Municipal Bonds rated by Moody s As A or better 80 of market value Listed Stocks 75 of market value Mutual Funds 75 of market value Cash Value Life Insurance 95 , less policy loans Savings/Time Deposits (Bank) 100 of current value Penny Stocks 0 General Business Accounts Receivable 80 of eligible accounts Inventory 50 of value Crop and Grain Inventories 80 of current market value Livestock 80 of purchase price, or current market value; or higher if cross-collateralized with other assets Fixed Assets (Existing) 50 of net book value, or 75 of orderly liquidation appraised value Fixed Assets (New) 80 of cost, or higher if cross-collateralized with other assets Leasehold Improvements 0 Generally, if the above collateral is part of a cross-collateralization with other approved assets, then the maximum advance percentage may be higher. The Company s lending policy specifies maximum term limits for C I loans. For term loans, the maximum term is generally seven years. Generally, term loans range from three to five years. For lines of credit, the maximum term is typically 365 days. In addition, the subsidiary banks often take personal guarantees or cosigners to help assure repayment. Loans may be made on an unsecured basis if warranted by the overall financial condition of the borrower.

 Following is a summary of the five largest industry concentrations within the C I portfolio as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: 

2022 2021 Amount Amount (dollars in thousands) Lessors of residential buildings and dwellings 309,784 387,818 Administration of urban planning and rural development 102,918 120,416 Bank holding companies 74,980 65,080 Solar electric power generation 35,947 18,983 Industrial machinery and equipment merchant wholesalers 34,808 28,123 These loan categories are defined by industry-standard NAICS codes refer to NAICS.com for a description of each category. CRE Lending The subsidiary banks also make CRE loans. CRE loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to C I loans, in addition to those standards and processes specific to real estate loans. Collateral for these loans generally includes the underlying real estate and improvements, and may include additional assets of the borrower. The Company s lending policy specifies maximum loan-to-value limits based on the category of CRE (commercial real estate loans on improved property, raw land, land development, and commercial construction). These limits are the same limits as, or in some situations, more conservative than, those established by regulatory authorities. Following is a listing of these limits as well as some of the other guidelines included in the Company s lending policy for the major categories of CRE loans: 

Maximum CRE Loan Types Maximum Advance Rate Term CRE loans on improved property 80 7 years Raw land Lesser of 90 of project cost, or 65 of as is appraised value 12 months Land development Lesser of 85 of project cost, or 75 of as-completed appraised value 24 months Commercial construction loans Lesser of 85 of project cost, or 80 of as-completed appraised value 24 months Residential construction loans to builders Lesser of 90 of project cost, or 80 of as-completed appraised value 15 months LIHTC construction loans 80 3 years LIHTC permanent loans 80 20 years 

 Generally, the debt service coverage ratio must be a minimum of 1.25x for non-owner occupied loans and 1.15x for owner-occupied loans that are subject to a DSCR covenant. For loans greater than 500 thousand, the subsidiary banks sensitize this ratio for deteriorated economic conditions, major changes in interest rates, and/or significant increases in vacancy rates. These maximum rates are consistent with, or in some situations, more conservative than those established by regulatory authorities. Some real estate transactions may offer a swap option whereby the maximum term is 20 years. Generally, the maximum term is 12 months but can be 15 months with credit risk committee monthly review. The Company s lending policy also includes guidelines for real estate appraisals and evaluations, including minimum appraisal and evaluation standards based on certain transactions. In addition, the subsidiary banks often take personal guarantees to help assure repayment. In addition, management tracks the level of owner-occupied CRE loans versus non-owner occupied CRE loans. Owner-occupied CRE loans are generally considered to have less risk. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 16 of the CRE loan portfolio was owner-occupied. In accordance with regulatory guidelines, the Company exercises heightened risk management practices when non-owner occupied CRE lending exceeds 300 of total risk-based capital and outstanding balances have increased 50 or more during the prior 36 months or construction, land development and other land loans exceed 100 of total risk-based capital. In addition, the banks have established policy limits around non-owner occupied CRE and total construction, land development and other land loans.

These loans have a maximum term of 20 years. Considering the longer duration, the subsidiary banks enter into a back-to-back interest rate swap to provide the borrower a long-term fixed interest rate while the subsidiary banks receive a variable interest rate and an upfront nonrefundable fee dependent on market pricing. In addition, the financing structure of the LIHTC permanent loans includes tax credit equity investment that strengthens the overall credit profile. Including the value of the real estate and the LIHTCs, the loan-to-values of the LIHTC permanent loans are typically in the range of 25 to 65 . Lastly, the Company has policy limits on maximum exposure amounts to single developers.

Most of these will convert to LIHTC permanent loans upon completion of construction. Additionally, the Company had approximately 119.7 million and 78.0 million of residential construction loans outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of this amount, approximately 61 was considered speculative, while 39 was pre-sold at December 31, 2022, and approximately 52 was considered speculative, while 48 was pre-sold at December 31, 2021. Direct Financing Leasing m2 leases machinery and equipment to C I customers under direct financing leases. All lease requests are subject to the credit requirements and criteria as set forth in the lending/leasing policy. In all cases, a formal independent credit analysis of the lessee is performed. The following private and public sector business assets are generally acceptable to consider for lease funding: Computer systems; Photocopy systems; Fire trucks; Specialized road maintenance equipment; Medical equipment; Commercial business furnishings; Vehicles classified as heavy equipment; Trucks and trailers; Equipment classified as plant or office equipment; and Marine boat lifts. 
 m2 will generally refrain from funding leases of the following type: Leases collateralized by non-marketable items; Leases collateralized by consumer items, such as vehicles, household goods, recreational vehicles, boats, etc.; Leases collateralized by used equipment, unless its remaining useful life can be readily determined; and Leases with a repayment schedule exceeding seven years. 
 Residential Real Estate Lending Generally, the subsidiary banks residential real estate loans conform to the underwriting requirements of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to allow the subsidiary banks to resell loans in the secondary market. The subsidiary banks structure most loans that will not conform to those underwriting requirements as adjustable rate mortgages that adjust in one to five years,

 and then retain these loans in their portfolios. Servicing rights are generally not retained on the loans sold in the secondary market. The Company s lending policy establishes minimum appraisal and other credit guidelines. The following table presents the originations and sales of residential real estate loans for the Company. Included in originations is activity related to the refinancing of previously held in-house mortgages. 

For the year ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (dollars in thousands) Originations of residential real estate loans 148,845 249,892 281,662 Sales of residential real estate loans 103,705 201,638 234,512 Percentage of sales to originations 70 81 83 Installment and Other Consumer Lending The consumer lending department of each subsidiary bank provides many types of consumer loans, including home improvement, home equity, motor vehicle, signature loans and small personal credit lines. The Company s lending policy addresses specific credit guidelines by consumer loan type. In particular, for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit, the minimum credit bureau score is 650. For both home equity loans and lines of credit, the maximum advance rate is 90 of value for primary residences and 80 for second/vacation homes. The maximum term on home equity loans is 10 years and maximum amortization is 15 years. The maximum term on home equity lines of credit is 10 years. In some instances for all loans/leases, it may be appropriate to originate or purchase loans/leases that are exceptions to the guidelines and limits established within the Company s lending policy described above. In general, exceptions to the lending policy do not significantly deviate from the guidelines and limits established within the lending policy and, if there are exceptions, they are generally noted as such and specifically identified in loan/lease approval documents. Human Capital Resources. The Company is a relationship driven company and its ability to attract and retain exceptional employees is key to its success. As of December 31, 2022, the Company employed 924 full-time employees and 77 part-time employees across all locations. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit. The Company encourages and supports the growth and development of its employees and, wherever possible, seeks to fill positions by promotion and transfer from within the organization. Continual learning and career development is advanced through ongoing performance and development conversations with employees, internally developed training programs and external training opportunities. Educational reimbursement is available to employees enrolled in degree or certification programs and for seminars, conferences, and other training events employees attend in connection with their job duties. As part of its compensation philosophy, the Company believes that it must offer and maintain market competitive total rewards programs for its employees in order to attract and retain exceptional talent. In addition to competitive base wages, additional programs include annual bonus opportunities, an employee stock purchase plan, Company matched 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, sabbaticals, flexible work schedules, an employee assistance program, and various wellness programs. The Company is committed to fostering and preserving a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion, and believes its differences, of every kind, make the company and its communities better. During recent years, the Company focused on several initiatives to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion across its organization. A few specific actions included rolling out a diversity survey for the third year to gather feedback from all employees, several diversity and inclusion sessions and workshops across our different entities facilitated by our Diversity Officer as well as the formation of Inclusion Committees across our different entities. The Company strives to maintain a culture in which employees feel valued and, to that end, regularly solicits feedback from employees to understand their views about their work environment and the Company s culture. The results from employee engagement surveys are used to implement programs and processes designed to enhance engagement and improve the employee experience. In 2022, 90 of employees participated in the annual employee engagement survey, exceeding the Company goal of 80 , and the Company received a strong employee engagement score of 78 , above the national benchmark of 74 .

Also available are many of the Company s corporate governance documents, including its Business Code of Conduct and Ethics Policy (https://qcrh.q4ir.com/governance/documents/default.aspx). Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, stockholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors: Economic and Market Risks Conditions in the financial market and economic conditions, including conditions in the markets in which we operate, generally may adversely affect our business. We operate primarily in the Quad Cities, Cedar Rapids, Waterloo/Cedar Falls, Des Moines/Ankeny, Iowa and Springfield, Missouri markets. Our general financial performance is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where we operate and in particular, the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services it offers. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment, natural disasters, pandemics or a combination of these or other factors. Uncertainty regarding economic conditions may result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing and savings habits. Downturns in the markets where our banking operations occur could result in a decrease in demand for our products and services, an increase in loan delinquencies and defaults, high or increased levels of problem assets and 
 13 

Table of Contents 
 foreclosures and reduced wealth management fees resulting from lower asset values. Such conditions could adversely affect the credit quality of our loans, financial condition and results of operations. Interest rates and other conditions impact our results of operations. Our profitability is in large part a function of the spread between the interest rates earned on investments and loans/leases and the interest rates paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. Like most banking institutions, our net interest spread and margin will be affected by general economic conditions and other factors, including fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government that influence market interest rates and our ability to respond to changes in such rates. At any given time, our assets and liabilities will be such that they are affected differently by a given change in interest rates. As a result, an increase or decrease in rates, the length of loan/lease terms, and the mix of adjustable and fixed rate loans/leases in our portfolio, the length of time deposits and borrowings and the rate sensitivity of our deposit customers could have a positive or negative effect on our net income, capital and liquidity. In addition, the size of nonrefundable swap fees earned in connection with our LIHTC permanent loans may fluctuate depending on the interest rate environment. We measure interest rate risk under various rate scenarios using specific criteria and assumptions. A summary of this process, along with the results of our net interest income simulations is presented at Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk included under Item 7A of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although we believe our current level of interest rate sensitivity is reasonable and effectively managed, significant fluctuations in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. It is currently expected that during 2023, and perhaps beyond, the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve, or FOMC, will continue to increase interest rates to reduce the rate of inflation. In 2022, the FOMC increased at various dates throughout the year the target range for the federal funds rate from 0.00 to 0.25 to a range of 4.25 to 4.50 . All of these increases were expressly made in response to inflationary pressures, which are currently expected to continue in 2023. If the FOMC further increases the targeted federal funds rates, overall interest rates will likely rise, which may negatively impact the entire national economy. In addition, our net interest income could be adversely affected if the rates we pay on deposits and borrowings increase more rapidly than the rates we earn on loans and other assets. Rising interest rates also may reduce the demand for loans and the value of fixed-rate investment securities. These effects from interest rate changes or from other sustained economic stress or a recession, among other matter, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. Given the complex factors affecting the strength of the U.S. economy, including uncertainties regarding the persistence of inflation, geopolitical developments such as the war in Ukraine and resulting disruptions in the global energy market, the effects of the pandemic in China, and tight labor market conditions and supply chain issues, there is a meaningful risk that the Federal Reserve and other central banks may raise interest rates more than expected, thereby limiting economic growth and potentially causing an economic recession. This could decrease loan demand, harm the credit characteristics of our existing loan portfolio and decrease the value of collateral securing loans in the portfolio. Declines in asset values may result in impairment charges and adversely affect the value of our investments, financial performance and capital. The market value of investments in our securities portfolio has become increasingly volatile in recent years, and as of December 31, 2022, we had gross unrealized losses of 116.7 million, or 11.8 of amortized cost, in our investment portfolio (offset by gross unrealized gains of 5.5 million). If we are forced to liquidate any of those investments prior to maturity, including because of a lack of liquidity, we would recognize as a charge to earnings the losses attributable to those securities. Our securities portfolio has an average duration of 8 years, so we expect an increase in realized losses if interest rates continue to increase in 2023.

 The market value of investments may be affected by factors other than the underlying performance of the servicer of the securities or the mortgages underlying the securities, such as changes in the interest rate environment, negative trends in the residential and commercial real estate markets, ratings downgrades, adverse changes in the business climate and a lack of liquidity in the secondary market for certain investment securities. On a quarterly basis, we formally evaluate investments and other assets for impairment indicators. Reduction in the value, or impairment of our investment securities, can impact our earnings and common stockholders equity. We maintained a balance of 928.1 million, or 12 of our assets, in investment securities at December 31, 2022. Changes in market interest rates can affect the value of these investment securities, with increasing interest rates generally resulting in a reduction of value. Although the reduction in value from temporary increases in market rates does not affect our income until the security is sold, it does result in an unrealized loss recorded in other comprehensive income that can reduce our common stockholders equity. Further, we may have to record provision expense to establish an allowance for credit losses on our carried at fair value debt securities, and we must periodically test our investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment in value. In assessing whether the value of investment securities is impaired, we consider the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value in the near term. Based on management s evaluation, it was determined that the gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2022 were primarily a function of the changes in certain market interest rates. A large percentage of our investment securities has fixed interest rates and are classified as available for sale. As is the case with many financial institutions, our emphasis on increasing the development of core deposits, those with no stated maturity date, has resulted in our interest-bearing liabilities having a shorter duration than our interest-earning assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility because interest rates change over time. As interest rates have increased, our cost of funds has increased more rapidly than the yields on a substantial portion of our interest-earning assets. In addition, the market value of our fixed-rate assets, for example, our investment securities, has declined in recent periods. In line with the foregoing, we have experienced and may continue to experience an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities primarily due to raising the rates we pay on some of our deposit products to stay competitive within our market and an increase in borrowing costs from increases in the federal funds rate. Community banks rely more heavily than larger institutions on net interest income as a revenue source. Larger institutions generally have more diversified sources of noninterest income. The stock market can be volatile, and fluctuations in our operating results and other factors could cause our stock price to decline. The stock market has experienced, and may continue to experience, fluctuations that significantly impact the market prices of securities issued by many companies. Market fluctuations could also adversely affect our stock price. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, systemic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, loss of investor confidence, interest rate changes, or international currency fluctuations, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. Moreover, our operating results may fluctuate and vary from period to period due to the risk factors set forth herein. As a result, period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our stock price could fluctuate significantly in response to our quarterly or annual results and the impact of these risk factors on our operating results or financial position. Secondary mortgage, government guaranteed loan and interest rate swap market conditions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Currently, we sell a portion of the residential real estate and government guaranteed loans we originate. The profitability of these operations depends in large part upon our ability to make loans and to sell them in the secondary market at a gain. Thus, we are dependent upon the existence of an active secondary market and our ability to profitably sell loans into that market. In addition to being affected by interest rates, the secondary markets are also subject to investor demand for residential mortgages and government guaranteed loans and investor yield requirements for those loans. These conditions may fluctuate or even worsen in the future. As a result, a prolonged period of secondary market illiquidity may reduce our loan production volumes and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The interest rate swap market is dependent upon market conditions. If interest rates move, interest rate swap transactions may no longer make sense for the Company and/or its customers. Interest rate swaps are generally appropriate for 
 15 

Table of Contents 
 commercial customers with a certain level of expertise and comfort with derivatives, so our success is dependent upon the ability to make loans to these types of commercial customers. Additionally, our ability to execute interest rate swaps is also dependent upon counterparties that are willing to enter into the interest rate swap that is equal and offsetting to the interest rate swap we enter into with the commercial customer. The mix of loans with interest rate swaps are heavily weighted towards LIHTC permanent loans. Future levels of swap fee income are dependent upon the needs of our traditional commercial and LIHTC borrowers, and the size of the related nonrefundable swap fee may fluctuate on the interest rate environment. Continued elevated levels of inflation could adversely impact our business and results of operations. The United States has recently experienced elevated levels of inflation, with the consumer price index climbing 6.5 in 2022. Continued elevated levels of inflation could have complex effects on our business and results of operations, some of which could be materially adverse. For example, elevated inflation harms consumer purchasing power, which could negatively affect our retail customers and the economic environment and, ultimately, many of our business customers, and could also negatively affect our levels of non-interest expense. In addition, if interest rates continue to continue to rise in response to elevated levels of inflation, the value of our securities portfolio could be negatively impacted. Continued elevated levels of inflation could also cause increased volatility and uncertainty in the business environment, which could adversely affect loan demand and our clients ability to repay indebtedness. It is also possible that governmental responses to the current inflation environment could adversely affect our business, such as changes to monetary and fiscal policy that are too strict, or the imposition or threatened imposition of price controls. The duration and severity of the current inflationary period cannot be estimated with precision. Labor shortages and failure to attract and retain qualified employees could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us or increase labor costs, including high employment levels, decreased labor force size and participation rates. Although we have not experienced any material labor shortage to date, we have recently observed an overall tightening and competitive local labor market. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base could lead to increased costs, such as increased compensation expense to attract and retain employees. In addition, if we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high-level, or if mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability have unintended negative effects, our business could be adversely affected. An overall labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation could have a material adverse impact on our operations, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows. The COVID-19 pandemic could continue to have adverse effects on our business. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant economic impact on the communities in which we operate, our borrowers and depositors, and the national economy generally. These effects have diminished in the past year, but future developments and uncertainties will be difficult to predict, such as the potential emergence of a new variant, the course of the pandemic in China and other major economies, the persistence of pandemic-related work and lifestyle changes, changes in consumer preferences associated with the emergence of the pandemic, and other market disruptions. Any such developments could have a complex and negative effect on our business, including with respect to the prevailing economic environment, our lending and investment activities, and our business operations . Regulatory and Legal Risks We may be materially and adversely affected by the highly regulated environment in which we operate. The Company and its bank subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal and state regulation, supervision and examination. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds, FDIC funds, customers and the banking system as a whole, rather than stockholders. These regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation and supervision primarily by the Federal Reserve. QCBT, CRBT and CSB, as Iowa-chartered state member banks, are subject to regulation and supervision primarily by both the Iowa Superintendent and the Federal Reserve. GB, as a Missouri-chartered commercial bank, is subject to regulation by both

 the Missouri Division of Finance and the Federal Reserve. We and our banks undergo periodic examinations by these regulators, who have extensive discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks and bank holding companies. The primary federal and state banking laws and regulations that affect us are described in Appendix A Supervision and Regulation to this report. These laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time. U.S. financial institutions are also subject to numerous monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements designed to detect and prevent illegal activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing. These requirements are imposed primarily through the Bank Secrecy Act which was most recently amended by the USA Patriot Act. We have instituted policies and procedures to protect us and our employees, to the extent reasonably possible, from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing and other financial crimes. There can be no guarantee, however, that these policies and procedures are effective. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil monetary penalties, and/or damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Although we have policies and procedures designed to mitigate the risk of any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur. Future legislation, regulation, and government policy could affect the banking industry as a whole, including our business and results of operations, in ways that are difficult to predict. In addition, our results of operations also could be adversely affected by changes in the way in which existing statutes and regulations are interpreted or applied by courts and government agencies. We are required to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, and if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, whether due to losses, an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as our ability to maintain regulatory compliance, would be adversely affected. The Company and each of its banking subsidiaries are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support their operations, which have recently increased due to the effectiveness of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms. We intend to grow our business organically and to explore opportunities to grow our business by taking advantage of attractive acquisition opportunities, and such growth plans may require us to raise additional capital to ensure that we have adequate levels of capital to support such growth on top of our current operations. Our ability to raise additional capital, when and if needed or desired, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry and market conditions, and governmental activities, many of which are outside our control, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. In particular, if we were required to raise additional capital in the current interest rate environment, we believe the pricing and other terms investors may require in such an offering may not be attractive to us. Our failure to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements could affect customer confidence, our ability to grow, our costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, our ability to pay dividends on common and preferred stock and to make distributions on our trust preferred securities, our ability to make acquisitions, and our business, results of operations and financial condition. Climate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may result in operational changes and expenditures that could significantly impact our business. The current and anticipated effects of climate change are creating an increasing level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, political and social attention to the issue of climate change has increased. In recent years, governments across the world have entered into international agreements to attempt to reduce global temperatures, in part by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies have continued to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change. Consumers and businesses may also change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. The impact on our customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities. Our efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions, including by increasing our business with climate-friendly companies, may not be effective in protecting us from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior.

 Given the lack of empirical data on the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change, it is difficult to predict how climate change may impact our financial condition and operations; however, as a banking organization, the physical effects of climate change may present certain unique risks. For example, weather disasters, shifts in local climates and other disruptions related to climate change may adversely affect the value of real properties securing our loans, which could diminish the value of our loan portfolio. Such events may also cause reductions in regional and local economic activity that may have an adverse effect on our customers, which could limit our ability to raise and invest capital in these areas and communities. Evolving law impacting cannabis-related businesses in Illinois and other states may have an impact on the Company s operations and risk profile. The Controlled Substances Act makes it illegal under federal law to manufacture, distribute, or dispense marijuana. Starting January 1, 2020, however, the Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act began permitting adults to legally purchase marijuana for recreational use from licensed dispensaries. It is the Banks current policy to avoid knowingly providing banking products or services to entities or individuals that: (i) directly or indirectly manufacture, distribute, or dispense marijuana or hemp products, or those with a significant financial interest in such entities; or (ii) derive a significant percentage of revenue from providing products or services to, or other involvement with, such entities. The Banks are taking reasonable measures, including appropriate new account screening and customer due diligence measures, to ensure that existing and potential customers do not engage in any such activities. Nonetheless, the shift in Illinois law legalizing cannabis use has increased the number of direct and indirect cannabis-related businesses in Illinois, and therefore has increased the likelihood that the Banks could interact with such businesses, as well as their owners and employees. Such interactions could create additional legal, regulatory, strategic, and reputational risk to the Banks and the Company. Credit and Lending Risks We must effectively manage our credit risk. There are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks inherent in dealing with specific borrowers, risks of nonpayment, risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral and risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions. In general, these risks have increased as a result of the recent increases in prevailing interest rates and uncertainties associated with inflation, which have potentially increased the risk of a near-term decline in growth or an economic downturn. We attempt to minimize our credit risk through prudent loan application approval procedures, careful monitoring of the concentration of our loans within specific industries and periodic independent reviews of outstanding loans by our credit review department and an external third party. However, we cannot assure you that such approval and monitoring procedures will reduce these credit risks. The majority of our subsidiary banks loan portfolios are invested in C I and CRE loans, and we focus on lending to small to medium-sized businesses. The size of the loans we can offer to commercial customers is less than the size of the loans that our competitors with larger lending limits can offer. This may limit our ability to establish relationships with the area s largest businesses. Smaller companies tend to be at a competitive disadvantage and generally have limited operating histories, less sophisticated internal record keeping and financial planning capabilities and fewer financial resources than larger companies. As a result, we may assume greater lending risks than financial institutions that have a lesser concentration of such loans and tend to make loans to larger, more established businesses. Collateral for these loans generally includes accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and real estate. However, depending on the overall financial condition of the borrower, some loans are made on an unsecured basis. In addition to C I and CRE loans, our subsidiary banks are also active in residential mortgage and consumer lending. Our borrowers may experience financial difficulties, and the level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise, which could negatively impact our business through increased provision, reduced interest income on loans/leases, and increased expenses incurred to carry and resolve problem loans/leases. C I loans make up a large portion of our loan/lease portfolio. C I loans were 1.7 billion, or approximately 28 of our total loan/lease portfolio, as of December 31, 2022. Our C I loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Because payments on such loans are often dependent on the successful operation of the borrower involved, repayment of such loans is often more sensitive than the other types of loans to adverse condition in the general economy. For example, the cumulative effects of decreased economic activity, changes in the economy and overall business environment, labor availability shortages and supply chain constraints as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic 
 18 

Table of Contents 
 have adversely affected C I loans, and we expect this trend to continue for certain portions of our loan portfolio, depending on the strength and speed of economic recovery and other factors, particularly if general economic conditions worsen. Most often, the collateral for C I loans is accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and real estate. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation value of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, if any exists. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers, which could decline in the case of an economic recession. The collateral securing these loans may lose value over time, may be difficult to appraise, and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. As a result of the recent increase in interest rates and other factors, we have observed a corresponding decline in the value of commercial real estate securing these loans. Our loan/lease portfolio has a significant concentration of CRE loans, which involve risks specific to real estate values. CRE lending comprises a significant portion of our lending business. Specifically, CRE loans were 3.9 billion, or approximately 64 of our total loan/lease portfolio, as of December 31, 2022. Of this amount, 629.4 million, or approximately 16 , was owner-occupied. The market value of real estate securing our CRE loans can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of interest rates and market conditions in the geographic area in which the real estate is located. Adverse developments affecting real estate values in one or more of our markets could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio. Additionally, real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of the loans generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Economic events or governmental regulations outside of the control of the borrower or lender could negatively impact the future cash flow and market values of the affected properties. Included in our CRE lending portfolio are our LIHTC construction and permanent loans, which have the same inherent risks as our other non-owner occupied CRE loans. However, the LIHTC construction and permanent loans, and related nonrefundable swap fee income, rely on federal LIHTCs to help finance the overall real estate projects and are dependent on the continued availability of such LIHTC programs. Changes to the LIHTC programs, including changes to the level of tax credits provided by the federal government on low income housing, may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Capital and Liquidity Risks Liquidity risks could affect operations and jeopardize our business, results of operations and financial condition. Liquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of securities and/or loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our primary sources of funds consist of cash from operations, deposits, investment maturities, repayments, and calls, and loan/lease repayments. Additional liquidity is provided by federal funds purchased from the FRB or other correspondent banks, FHLB advances, wholesale and customer repurchase agreements, brokered deposits, and the ability to borrow at the FRB s Discount Window. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. In addition, increased competition with the largest banks and Fintechs for retail deposits may impact our ability to raise funds through deposits and could have a negative effect on our liquidity. Any decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans/leases, invest in securities, meet our expenses, pay dividends to our stockholders, or fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, results of operations and financial condition. As a bank holding company, our sources of funds are limited. We are a bank holding company, and our operations are primarily conducted by our subsidiary banks, which are subject to significant federal and state regulation. When available, cash to pay dividends to our stockholders is derived primarily 
 19 

Table of Contents 
 from dividends received from our subsidiary banks. Our ability to receive dividends or loans from our subsidiary banks is restricted. Dividend payments by our subsidiaries to us in the future will require generation of future earnings by them and could require regulatory approval if any proposed dividends are in excess of prescribed guidelines. Further, as a structural matter, our right to participate in the assets of our subsidiary banks in the event of a liquidation or reorganization of any of the banks would be subject to the claims of the creditors of such bank, including depositors, which would take priority except to the extent we may be a creditor with a recognized claim. As of December 31, 2022, our subsidiary banks had deposits, borrowings and other liabilities in the aggregate of approximately 11.9 billion. Our allowance may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan/lease portfolio. We establish our allowance for credit losses in consultation with management of our subsidiaries and maintain it at a level considered adequate by management to absorb loan/lease losses that are inherent in the portfolio. The amount of future loan/lease losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, which may be beyond our control, and such losses may exceed current estimates. At December 31, 2022, our allowance as a percentage of total gross loans/leases was 1.43 , and as a percentage of total NPLs was 1,000.07 . In addition, we had net charge-offs as a percentage of gross average loans/leases of 0.06 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Because of the concentration of C I and CRE loans in our loan portfolio, which tend to be larger in amount than residential real estate and installment loans, the movement of a small number of loans to nonperforming status can have a significant impact on these ratios. Although management believes that the allowance as of December 31, 2022 was adequate to absorb losses on any existing loans/leases that may become uncollectible, we cannot predict loan/lease losses with certainty, and we cannot assure you that our allowance will prove sufficient to cover actual loan/lease losses in the future, particularly if economic conditions are more difficult than what management currently expects. Additional provisions and loan/lease losses in excess of our allowance may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Competitive and Strategic Risks We face intense competition in all phases of our business from other banks, financial institutions and non-bank financial services providers. The banking and financial services businesses in our markets are highly competitive. Our competitors include large regional banks, local community banks, savings and loan associations, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, Fintech companies, money market mutual funds, credit unions, online lenders and other non-bank financial services providers. Many of these competitors are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as we are. Many of our unregulated competitors compete across geographic boundaries and are able to provide customers with a feasible alternative to traditional banking services. While we do not offer products relating to digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and other similar assets, there has been a significant increase in digital asset adoption globally over the past several years. Certain characteristics of digital asset transactions, such as the speed with which such transactions can be conducted, the ability to transact without the involvement of regulated intermediaries, the ability to engage in transactions across multiple jurisdictions, and the anonymous nature of the transactions, are appealing to certain consumers notwithstanding the various risks posed by such transactions. Accordingly, digital asset service providers which at present are not subject to the same degree of scrutiny and oversight as banking organizations and other financial institutions are becoming active competitors to more traditional financial institutions. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as disintermediation, could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Potential partnerships with digital asset companies, moreover, could also entail significant investment. Increased competition may result in a decrease in the amounts of our loans and deposits, reduced spreads between loan/lease rates and deposit rates or loan/lease terms that are more favorable to the borrower. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and remain profitable. If increased competition causes us to significantly discount the interest rates we offer on loans or increase the amount we pay on deposits, our net interest income could be adversely impacted. If increased competition causes us to modify our underwriting standards, we could be 
 20 

Table of Contents 
 exposed to higher losses from lending and leasing activities. Additionally, many of our competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets, have larger lending limits and offer a broader range of financial services than we can offer. Potential future acquisitions could be difficult to integrate, divert the attention of key personnel, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our financial results. As part of our business strategy, we may consider acquisitions of other banks or financial institutions or branches, assets or deposits of such organizations. There is no assurance, however, that we will determine to pursue any of these opportunities or that if we determine to pursue them that we will be successful. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including: difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products, existing contracts, accounting processes and personnel of the target company and realizing the anticipated synergies of the combined businesses; difficulties in supporting and transitioning customers of the target company; diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations; the price we pay or other resources that we devote may exceed the value we realize, or the value we could have realized if we had allocated the purchase price or other resources to another opportunity; risks of entering new markets or areas in which we have limited or no experience or are outside our core competencies; potential loss of key employees, customers and strategic alliances from either our current business or the business of the target company; risks of acquiring loans with deteriorated credit quality; assumption of unanticipated problems or latent liabilities; and inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs. 
 Future acquisitions may involve the issuance of our equity securities as payment or in connection with financing the business or assets acquired, and as a result, could dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. In addition, consummating these transactions could result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense, as well as unforeseen liabilities, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The failure to successfully evaluate and execute acquisitions or otherwise adequately address the risks associated with acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. New lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks. From time to time, we may seek to implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business in our current markets or new markets. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible, which could in turn have a material negative effect on our operating results. If securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research reports about us, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, the price of our stock could decline. The trading market for our common stock can be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If there is limited or no securities or industry analyst 
 21 

Table of Contents 
 coverage of us, the market price for our stock could be negatively impacted. Moreover, if any of the analysts who elect to cover us downgrade our common stock, provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors or if our operating results or prospects do not meet their expectations, the market price of our common stock may decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline. Our reputation could be damaged by negative publicity. Reputational risk, or the risk to our business, financial condition or results of operations from negative publicity, is inherent in our business. Negative publicity can result from actual or alleged conduct in a number of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, inadequate protection of customer data, ethical behavior of our employees, and from actions taken by regulators, ratings agencies and others as a result of that conduct. Damage to our reputation could impact our ability to attract new or maintain existing loan and deposit customers, employees and business relationships. Accounting and Tax Risks The FASB has issued an accounting standard update that has resulted in a significant change in how the Company recognizes credit losses and may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which replaced the incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses with an expected loss model referred to as the CECL model. The new CECL standard became effective for us on January 1, 2021. Under the CECL model, we are required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. CECL also requires that an allowance for credit losses be established for any unfunded loan commitments that are not cancelable. The measurement of expected credit losses requires significant use of management judgments and is based on information from past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement takes place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the incurred loss model previously required under GAAP, which delayed recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, the adoption of the CECL model materially affected how we determine our allowance for credit losses and could require us to significantly increase our allowance in future periods. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of the allowance for credit losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for credit losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Note 1 Nature of Business and Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the impact of the adoption of this standard. The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments, which are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and which may differ from actual results. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and general reporting practices within the financial services industry, which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Some accounting policies, such as those pertaining to our allowance, require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in subsequent periods. From time to time, the FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of our external financial statements. In addition, trends in financial and business reporting, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) related disclosures, could require us to incur additional reporting expense. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our financial condition and results of operations.

 Operational Risks The transition to an alternative reference rate could cause instability and have a negative effect on financial market conditions. LIBOR represents the interest rate at which banks offer to lend funds to one another in the international interbank market for short-term loans. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR rates after 2021. The end date for LIBOR has now been set for June 30, 2023, and U.S. Regulators have issued guidance that urges market participants to address their existing LIBOR exposures and transition to robust and sustainable alternative rates. The Alternative Reference Rate Committee has proposed that the SOFR is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to U.S. dollar-LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to LIBOR but has also advised participants to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of any alternative reference rates being considered for use. Contracts linked to LIBOR are vast in number and value, are intertwined with numerous financial products and services, and have diverse parties. Although the Company has actively worked to plan for the transition away from LIBOR, the transition is both complex and challenging and the downstream effect of unwinding or transitioning such contracts could cause instability and negatively impact financial markets and individual institutions. If the Company s selected alternative rate is based on small transaction volume, it could be susceptible to volatility and disruption during times of market stress. Furthermore, if the Company fails to properly address legacy contracts by adding robust fallback positions, it will be exposed to interest rate risks and potential loss of yields. Finally, if the Company or other market participants fail to properly plan to implement alternative rates other than LIBOR it could have an adverse effect on the Company and the financial system as a whole. The Company s information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security and cyber-attacks, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business. The Company relies heavily on internal and outsourced technologies, communications, and information systems to conduct its business, particularly with respect to our core processing provider and our mobile banking provider. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Company collects, processes and retains sensitive and confidential information regarding our customers. As the Company s reliance on technology has increased, so have the potential risks of a technology-related operation interruption (such as disruptions in the Company s customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan, or other systems) or the occurrence of a cyber-attacks (such as unauthorized access to the Company s systems). These risks have increased for all financial institutions as new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others have also increased. In addition, cyber attackers have taken advantage of the pandemic to create campaigns to leverage individuals fears and uncertainties as well as capitalize on the increased number of transactions occurring on digital channels. Industry trends in ransomware, phishing, and other intrusion methods have increased significantly and will continue to pose increased risk while the Company s operations remain partially remote. In addition to cyber-attacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers have engaged in attacks against financial institutions, retailers and government agencies, particularly denial of service attacks that are designed to disrupt key business or government services, such as customer-facing web sites. The Company is not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. It is also possible that a cyber incident, such as a security breach, may remain undetected for a period of time, further exposing the Company to technology-related risks. The Company also faces risks related to cyber-attacks and other security breaches in connection with credit card, debit card and other payment related transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding the Company s customers through various third parties, including merchant acquiring banks, payment processors, payment card networks and its processors. Some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyber-attacks, and because the transactions involve third parties and environments such as the point of sale that the Company does not control or secure, future security breaches or cyber-attacks affecting any of these third parties could impact the Company through no fault of its own, and in some cases it may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks 
 23

 relating to them. Further cyber-attacks or other breaches in the future, whether affecting the Company or others, could intensify consumer concern and regulatory focus and result in increased costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business. To the extent we are involved in any future cyber-attacks or other breaches, the Company s reputation could be affected, which could also have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition or results of operations. System failure or breaches of our network security could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities. The computer systems and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Computer break-ins, phishing and other disruptions could also jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure, as well as that of our customers engaging in internet banking activities, which may result in significant liability to us and may cause existing and potential customers to refrain from doing business with us. Although we, with the help of third-party service providers, intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such damage, there can be no assurance that these security measures will be successful. In addition, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we and our third-party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data. Any interruption in, or breach of security of, our computer systems and network infrastructure, or that of our internet banking customers, could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The Company may also need to spend additional resources to enhance protective and detective measures or to conduct investigations to remediate any vulnerabilities that arise. We are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, customer or employee misconduct or fraud and data processing system failures and errors. Employee errors and employee and customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence. We maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. Despite having business continuity plans and other safeguards, the Company could still be affected. Should our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, and if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The success of our SBA lending program is dependent upon the continued availability of SBA loan programs, our status as a preferred lender under the SBA loan programs and our ability to comply with applicable SBA lending requirements. As an SBA Preferred Lender, we enable our clients to obtain SBA loans without being subject to the potentially lengthy SBA approval process necessary for lenders that are not SBA Preferred Lenders. The SBA periodically reviews the lending operations of participating lenders to assess, among other things, whether the lender exhibits prudent risk management. When weaknesses are identified, the SBA may request corrective actions or impose other restrictions, including revocation of the lender s SBA Preferred Lender status. If we lose our status as an SBA Preferred Lender, we may lose our ability to compete effectively with other SBA Preferred Lenders, and as a result we would experience a material adverse effect to our financial results. Any changes to the SBA program, including changes to the level of guaranty provided by the federal government on SBA loans or changes to the level of funds appropriated by the federal government to the various SBA programs, may also have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

 Historically we have sold the guaranteed portion of our SBA loans in the secondary market. These sales have resulted in our earning premium income and/or have created a stream of future servicing income. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue originating these loans, that a secondary market will exist or that we will continue to realize premiums upon the sale of the guaranteed portion of these loans. When we sell the guaranteed portion of our SBA loans, we incur credit risk on the retained, non-guaranteed portion of the loans. In the event of a loss resulting from default and the SBA determines there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded or serviced by the us, the SBA may require us to repurchase the loan, deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of the principal loss related to the deficiency from us, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our community banking strategy relies heavily on our subsidiaries independent management teams, and the unexpected loss of key managers may adversely affect our operations. We rely heavily on the success of our bank subsidiaries independent management teams. Accordingly, much of our success to date has been influenced strongly by our ability to attract and to retain senior management experienced in banking and financial services and familiar with the communities in our market areas. Our ability to retain the executive officers and current management teams of our operating subsidiaries will continue to be important to the successful implementation of our strategy. It is also critical, as we manage our existing portfolio and grow, to be able to attract and retain qualified additional management and loan officers with the appropriate level of experience and knowledge about our market areas to implement our community-based operating strategy. Recent changes in labor market conditions have contributed to heightened levels of employee attrition and increased competition for talent, which has in turn driven wage rates higher and may contribute to an increase in operating expenses. The unexpected loss of services of any key management personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. We have a continuing need for technological change, and we may not have the resources to effectively implement new technology. The financial services industry continues to undergo rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to enabling us to better serve our customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and the potential for cost reduction. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. The widespread adoption of new technologies, including mobile banking services, cryptocurrencies and payment systems, could require us in the future to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services as we grow and develop new products to satisfy our customers expectations and comply with regulatory guidance. Many of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to offer additional or superior products to those that we will be able to offer, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. Accordingly, a risk exists that we will not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to our customers. We have a substantial amount of debt outstanding and may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which could restrict our operations. As of December 31, 2022, we had 281.3 million of total indebtedness outstanding at the holding company level. In the future, it is possible that we may not generate sufficient revenues to service or repay our debt, and have sufficient funds left over to achieve or sustain profitability in our operations, meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs, and to pay dividends to our common stockholders. Moreover, the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences for our stockholders, including:

 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; making it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt and other obligations; limiting our ability to borrow additional funds, or to sell assets to raise funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes; increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates; and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt. 
 Severe weather, natural disasters, pandemic, acts of terrorism or war or other adverse external events could significantly impact the Company s business. As the Company s operating and market footprint continues to grow, severe weather, natural disasters, pandemic, acts of terrorism or war and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Company s ability to conduct business. The Company s current footprint poses a wide variety of potential weather, natural disaster, or other adverse events that could impact the Company in various ways. In addition, such events could affect the stability of the Company s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. The occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operation. The Company is or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences. Many aspects of our business and operations involve the risk of legal liability, and in some cases we or our subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from our business activities. In addition, companies in our industry are frequently the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which we conduct our business, or reputational harm. Although we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we do not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings in question. Accordingly, our ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

 I tem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and annual comparison between our fiscal 2022 performance compared to our fiscal 2021 performance. A detailed review of our fiscal 2021 performance compared to our fiscal 2020 performance can be found in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, under the caption Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes thereto included or incorporated by reference elsewhere in this document. Additionally, a comprehensive list of the acronyms and abbreviations used throughout this discussion is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. GENERAL The Company was formed in February 1993 for the purpose of organizing QCBT. Over the past twenty-nine years, the Company has grown to include four banking subsidiaries and a number of nonbanking subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 7.9 billion in consolidated assets, including 6.1 billion in total loans/leases, and 6.0 billion in deposits. The financial results of acquired/merged entities for the periods since their acquisition/merger are included in this report. Further information related to acquired/merged entities has been presented in the Annual Reports previously filed with the SEC corresponding to the year of each acquisition/merger. On April 1, 2022, the Company completed its acquisition of GFED and on April 2, 2022 merged Guaranty Bank, the banking subsidiary of GFED, into the Company s Springfield-based charter, Springfield First Community Bank. The combined bank changed its name to Guaranty Bank. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The Company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The financial information contained within these statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance, determination of the fair value of loans acquired in business combinations, impairment of goodwill and the fair value of financial instruments. A more detailed discussion of these critical accounting policies and estimates can be found in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on its consideration of accounting policies and estimates that involve the most complex and subjective decisions and assessments, management has identified the following as critical accounting policies and estimates: GO ODWILL The Company records all assets and liabilities purchased in an acquisition, including intangibles, at fair value. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject, at a minimum, to annual tests for impairment. In certain situations, interim impairment tests may be required if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The initial recognition of goodwill and subsequent impairment analysis requires us to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets will perform in the future using valuation methods, which may include using the current market price of stock or discounted cash flow analyses. Additionally, estimated cash flows may extend beyond five years and, by their nature, are difficult to determine over an extended timeframe. Events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include, among others, competitive forces, customer behaviors, changes in revenue growth trends, cost structures, technology, changes in discount rates and market conditions. In determining the reasonableness of cash flow estimates, the Company reviews historical performance of the underlying assets or similar assets in an effort to assess and validate assumptions utilized in its estimates. In assessing the fair value of reporting units, we may consider the stage of the current business cycle and potential changes in market conditions. We may also utilize other information to validate the reasonableness of our valuations, including 
 30 

Table of Contents 
 public market comparables and multiples of recent mergers and acquisitions of similar businesses. Valuation multiples may be based on tangible capital ratios of comparable companies and business segments. These multiples may be adjusted to consider competitive differences, including size, operating leverage and other factors. The carrying amount of a reporting unit is determined based on the capital required to support the reporting unit s activities, including its tangible and intangible assets. The determination of a reporting unit s capital allocation requires judgment and considers many factors, including the regulatory capital regulations and capital characteristics of comparably situated companies in relevant industry sectors. In certain circumstances, the Company will engage a third-party to independently validate our assessment of the fair value of our reporting units. The Company assesses the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors considered important, which could trigger an impairment review, include the following: Significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; Significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business; Significant negative industry or economic trends; Significant decline in the market price for our common stock over a sustained period; or Market capitalization relative to net book value. As of November 30, 2022, the Company s management performed an annual assessment at the reporting unit level and determined no goodwill impairment existed. ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LOANS AND LEASES AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES On January 1, 2021, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), which replaces the incurred loss methodology with a current expected credit loss methodology, known as CECL. Additionally, CECL required an allowance for OBS exposures and HTM securities to be calculated using a current expected credit loss methodology. The Company s allowance methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations, both quantitative and qualitative, in establishing an allowance that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date. The Company s methodologies for estimating the ACL consider available relevant information about the collectability of cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The methodologies apply historical loss information adjusted for asset-specific characteristics, economic conditions at the measurement date, and forecasts about future economic conditions that are expected to exist through the contractual lives of the financial assets and that are reasonable and supportable to the identified pools of financial assets with similar risk characteristics for which the historical loss experience was observed. If a loan is determined to no longer share similar risk characteristics with other assets in the segmented pool, it is evaluated on an individual basis. The Company also estimates expected credit losses over the contractual term of the loan for the unfunded portion of the loan commitment that is not unconditionally cancellable by the Company. Management uses an estimated average utilization rate to determine the exposure of default. The allowance for OBS exposures is calculated using probability of default and loss given default using the same segmentation and qualitative factors used for loans and leases. Although management believes the level of the ACL as of December 31, 2022 was adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan/lease portfolio and OBS exposures, a decline in local economic conditions, or other factors, could result in increasing losses that cannot be reasonably predicted at this time. FAIR VALUE OF LOANS ACQUIRED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS Loans acquired in business combinations are initially recorded at fair value as adjusted for credit risk and an allowance for credit losses at the date of acquisition. For loans with no significant evidence of credit deterioration since origination, the difference between the fair value and the unpaid principal balance of the loan at the acquisition date is amortized into interest income using the effective interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity. Loans acquired with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination, or PCD loans, are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 326-20 Financial instruments - credit losses. Determining the fair value of the loans involves estimating the amount and timing of principal and interest cash flows initially expected to be collected on the loans and 
 31 

Table of Contents 
 discounting those cash flows at an appropriate market rate of interest. An allowance for credit losses is recognized by estimating the expected credit losses of the purchased asset and recording an adjustment to the acquisition date fair value to establish the initial amortized cost basis of the asset. Differences between the established fair value, or amortized cost basis, and the unpaid principal balance of the asset is considered to be a non-credit discount/premium and is accreted/amortized into interest income using the interest method in accordance with ASC 310-10. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through provision for credit loss expense using the same methodology as other loans held for investment. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts business. A framework has been established for measuring the fair value of financial instruments that considers the attributes specific to particular assets or liabilities and includes a three-level hierarchy for determining fair value based on the transparency of inputs to each valuation as of the measurement date. The Company estimates the fair value of financial instruments using a variety of valuation methods. When financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used for fair value and are classified as Level 1. When financial instruments, such as investment securities and derivatives, are not actively traded the Company determines fair value based on various sources and may apply matrix pricing with observable prices for similar instruments where a price for the identical instrument is not observable. The fair values of these financial instruments, which are classified as Level 2, are determined by pricing models that consider observable market data such as interest rate volatilities, LIBOR yield curve, credit spreads, prices from external market data providers and/or nonbinding broker-dealer quotations. When observable inputs do not exist, the Company estimates fair value based on available market data, and these values are classified as Level 3. FAIR VALUE OF SECURITIES The fair value of securities is determined monthly and the securities are stated at fair value. For available for sale securities, unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of stockholders equity, net of the related tax effect. For both available for sale and held to maturity debt securities, any portion of a decline in value associated with credit loss is recognized in income with the remaining noncredit related component being recognized in other comprehensive income. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW The Company reported net income of 99.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and diluted EPS of 5.87. For the same period in 2021 the Company reported net income of 98.9 million and diluted EPS of 6.20. The year ended December 31, 2022 was highlighted by several significant items: Annual net income of 99.1 million, or 5.87 per diluted share; Record adjusted net income (non-GAAP) of 114.9 million, or 6.80 per diluted share, an increase of 14.8 and 8.5 , respectively, excluding one-time expenses associated with the GFED acquisition; and Full year loan and lease growth of 14.6 for the year, excluding PPP and GFED acquired loans (non-GAAP). Following is a table that represents the various net income measurements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net income 99,066 98,905 Diluted earnings per common share 5.87 6.20 Weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding 16,890,007 15,944,708 The Company reported adjusted net income (non-GAAP) of 114.9 million, with adjusted diluted EPS of 6.80. See section titled GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations for additional information. Adjusted net income for the year excludes a number of non-recurring items, after-tax, most significantly:

Table of Contents 
 9.8 million of CECL Day 2 provision for credit losses related to the GFED acquisition; 4.4 million of post-acquisition compensation, transition and integration costs; and 3.2 million of acquisition costs. The increase in weighted average common shares outstanding when comparing the year ended December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2021 was primarily due to the common stock issuance in connection with the acquisition of GFED as discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Following is a table that represents the major income and expense categories. 

Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (dollars are in thousands) Net interest income 231,120 178,233 Provision for credit losses 8,284 3,486 Noninterest income 80,729 100,422 Noninterest expense 190,016 153,702 Federal and state income tax expense 14,483 22,562 Net income 99,066 98,905 The following are some noteworthy developments in the Company s financial results: Net interest income grew 52.9 million, or 29.7 , in 2022 compared to the prior year. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to an improved net interest margin, driven primarily by our asset-sensitive balance sheet in the rising interest rate environment. Provision expense increased 4.8 million when comparing 2022 to 2021. The increase in 2022 was due to a CECL Day 2 provision for credit losses on acquired loans with the GFED transaction. See the Provision for Credit Losses section of this report for additional details. Noninterest income decreased 19.7 million, or 19.6 when compared to the prior year. The decrease in 2022 was primarily attributable to lower capital markets revenue from swap fee income. Lower capital markets revenue was due to delays in client projects caused by ongoing supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures and higher interest rates. The demand for low-income housing remains healthy and the economics associated with these tax credit projects continue to be favorable. The Company has a strong pipeline for this business and expects it to be a solid source of fee income in 2023. Noninterest expense increased 36.3 million, or 23.6 , in 2022 compared to the prior year, primarily due to acquisition costs and post-acquisition compensation, transition and integration costs of 9.2 million associated with the acquisition of GFED as well as nine months of operating expenses in 2022 for the combined Guaranty Bank entity as compared to 2021. See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. STRATEGIC FINANCIAL METRICS The Company has established strategic financial metrics by which it manages its business and measures its performance. The metrics are periodically updated to reflect business developments. While the Company is determined to work prudently to achieve these metrics, there is no assurance that they will be met. Moreover, the Company s ability to achieve these metrics may be affected by the factors discussed under Forward Looking Statements as well as the factors detailed in the Risk Factors section included under Item 1A. of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company s strategic financial metrics are as follows: Grow loans/leases by 9 per year, funded by core deposits; Grow fee-based income by at least 6 per year; and 
 33 

Table of Contents 
 Limit our annual operating expense growth to 5 per year. 
 The following table shows the evaluation of the Company s strategic financial metrics: 

For the Year Ending Strategic Financial Metric Key Metric Target December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Loan and lease growth organically Loans and leases growth > 9 annually 14.6 16.9 Fee income growth Fee income growth > 6 annually (21.5) (10.1) Improve operational efficiencies and hold noninterest expense growth Noninterest expense growth 18.8 4.0 The calculations provided exclude non-core noninterest income and noninterest expense. Loan and lease growth excludes the initial loan balances from the GFED acquisition and PPP loans. Fee income growth and noninterest expense growth are both impacted by the GFED acquisition. It should be noted that these initiatives are long-term targets. STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENTS The Company took the following actions in 2022 to support our corporate strategy and further the strategic financial metrics shown above: The Company grew loans and leases in 2022 by 31.2 . Loan and lease growth excluding PPP and GFED acquired loans (non-GAAP) was 14.6 . The loan growth was driven by both our specialty finance group and our traditional commercial lending and leasing businesses. Correspondent banking continues to be a core line of business for the Company. The Company is competitively positioned with experienced staff, software systems and processes to continue growing in the four states it currently serves Iowa, Wisconsin, Missouri and Illinois. The Company acts as the correspondent bank for 185 downstream banks with total average noninterest bearing deposits of 246.0 million and total average interest-bearing deposits of 330.7 million for 2022. This line of business provides a strong source of noninterest bearing and interest-bearing deposits, fee income, high-quality loan participations and bank stock loans. The Company also manages off-balance sheet liquidity held at the Federal Reserve on behalf of the downstream banks of 339.5 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company is focused on executing interest rate swaps on select commercial loans, including LIHTC permanent loans. The interest rate swaps allow the commercial borrowers to pay a fixed interest rate while the Company receives a variable interest rate as well as an upfront nonrefundable fee dependent on the pricing. Management believes that these swaps help position the Company more favorably for rising rate environments. The Company will continue to review opportunities to execute these swaps at all of its subsidiary banks, as the circumstances are appropriate for the borrower and the Company. Levels of capital markets revenue from swap fee income are influenced by prevailing interest rates. Capital markets revenue from swap fee income totaled 41.3 million in 2022 as compared to 61.0 million in 2021. Capital markets revenue from swap fees averaged 10.3 million per quarter for the year 2022 and 15.2 million per quarter for the year 2021. In recent years, the Company has been successful in expanding its wealth management client base. Trust fees continue to be a significant contributor to noninterest income. Assets under management decreased by 842.4 million in 2022 due to market volatility. There were 340 new relationships added in 2022 totaling 481.0 million of new assets under management. Income is generated primarily from fees charged based on assets under administration for corporate and personal trusts and for custodial services. The majority of the trust fees are determined based on the value of the investments within the fully-managed trusts. The Company expects trust fees to be negatively impacted during periods of significantly lower market valuations and positively impacted during periods of significantly higher market valuations. Noninterest expense in 2022 totaled 190.0 million as compared to 153.7 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to 9.2 million of acquisition costs and post-acquisition compensation, transition and integration costs in 2022 related to the acquisition of GFED, as discussed in the Company s financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, the increase is due to nine months of operating expenses in 2022 for the combined Guaranty Bank entity as compared to 2021.

 GAAP TO NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS The following table presents certain non-GAAP financial measures related to the TCE/TA ratio , adjusted net income , adjusted EPS , adjusted ROAA , NIM (TEY) , adjusted NIM , efficiency ratio and loan growth excluding acquired and PPP loans . In compliance with applicable rules of the SEC, all non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, as follows: TCE/TA ratio (non-GAAP) is reconciled to stockholders equity and total assets; Adjusted net income, adjusted EPS and adjusted ROAA (all non-GAAP measures) are reconciled to net income; NIM (TEY) (non-GAAP) and adjusted NIM (TEY) (non-GAAP) are reconciled to NIM; Efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) is reconciled to noninterest expense, net interest income and noninterest income; and Loan growth excluding acquired and PPP loans (non-GAAP) is reconciled to total loans and leases. 
 The TCE/TA non-GAAP ratio has been a focus for our investors and management believes that this ratio may assist investors in analyzing the Company s capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets. The following tables also include several adjusted non-GAAP measurements of financial performance. The Company s management believes that these measures are important to investors as they exclude non-core or non-recurring income and expense items; therefore, they provide a better comparison for analysis and may provide a better indicator of future performance. NIM (TEY) is a financial measure that the Company s management utilizes to take into account the tax benefit associated with certain loans and securities. It is standard industry practice to measure net interest margin using tax-equivalent measures. In addition, the Company calculates NIM without the impact of acquisition accounting net accretion (adjusted NIM), as accretion amounts can fluctuate a great deal, making comparisons difficult. The efficiency ratio is a ratio that management utilizes to compare the Company to peers. It is standard in the banking industry and widely utilized by investors. Loan growth, excluding acquired and PPP loans, is a ratio that management utilizes to compare the Company to its peers. The Company s management believes this financial measure is important to investors as total loans and leases for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were materially higher due to the addition of acquired and PPP loans. By excluding the acquired and PPP loans, the investor is provided a better comparison to prior years for analysis. Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.

From a profitability standpoint, an important challenge for the Company s subsidiary banks and leasing company is focusing on quality growth in conjunction with the improvement of their NIMs. Management continually addresses this issue with pricing and other balance sheet management strategies which included better loan pricing, reducing reliance on very rate-sensitive funding, closely managing deposit rate increases and finding additional ways to manage cost of funds through derivatives.

(3) Loan/lease fees are not material and are included in interest income from loans/leases receivable in accordance with accounting and regulatory guidance. 
 The Company s operating results are also impacted by various sources of noninterest income, including trust fees, investment advisory and management fees, deposit service fees, swap fee income, gains from the sales of residential real estate loans and government guaranteed loans, earnings on BOLI and other income. Offsetting these items, the Company incurs noninterest expenses, which include salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expense, professional and data processing fees, FDIC and other insurance expense, loan/lease expense and other administrative expenses. The Company s operating results are also affected by economic and competitive conditions, particularly changes in interest rates, income tax rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 and 2021 INTEREST INCOME For 2022, interest income increased 92.4 million, or 46 , compared to 2021. For 2022, interest income (tax equivalent) increased 98.5 million, or 47 , compared to 2021. This was due to an increase in the yield of average securities and average loans/leases as well as an increased volume of average loans/leases. The Company intends to continue to grow quality loans and leases as well as its private placement tax-exempt securities portfolio to maximize yield while minimizing credit and interest rate risk. INTEREST EXPENSE Comparing 2022 to 2021, interest expense increased 39.5 million, or 180 , year-over-year. The increase is primarily due to an increase in cost of funds given the rising rate environment. The Company s cost of funds was 1.28 for the year ending December 31, 2022, which was up from 0.59 for the year ending December 31, 2021.

 PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES The ACL is established through provision for credit losses expense to provide an estimated ACL. The following table shows the components for the provision for credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 (dollars in thousands) Provision for credit losses - loans and leases 9,636 5,702 Provision for credit losses - off-balance sheet exposures (1,334) (2,231) Provision for credit losses - held to maturity securities (18) 15 Total provision for credit losses 8,284 3,486 The Company s total provision for credit losses was 8.3 million for 2022, an increase of 4.8 million from 2021. The increase in provision on loans and leases was driven by the CECL Day 2 credit loss expense on performing loans of 11.0 million (pre-tax) as a result of the GFED acquisition, offset by negative provision recorded at the other three charters. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the provision related to OBS was a negative 1.3 million which included a 1.4 million provision related to the acquisition of GFED, compared to a negative 2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was due a reduction in the qualitative factors related to economic improvement in the CECL forecast along with improvement in economic factors and credit quality within the qualitative factor matrix. The ACL for loans and leases is established based on a number of factors, including the Company s historical loss experience, delinquencies and charge-off trends, economic and other forecasts, the local, state and national economies and the risk associated with the loans/leases and securities in the portfolio as described in more detail in the Critical Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates section. The Company had an ACL on loans/leases of 1.43 of total gross loans/leases at December 31, 2022, compared to 1.68 of total gross loans/leases at December 31, 2021. Management evaluates the allowance needed on the acquired loans factoring in the remaining discount, which was 6.1 million and 1.5 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additional discussion of the Company s allowance can be found in the Financial Condition section of this report. NONINTEREST INCOME The following tables set forth the various categories of noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 Change Change (dollars in thousands) Trust fees 10,641 11,206 (565) (5.0) Investment advisory and management fees 3,858 4,080 (222) (5.4) Deposit service fees 8,134 6,132 2,002 32.6 Gains on sales of residential real estate loans, net 2,411 4,397 (1,986) (45.2) Gains on sales of government guaranteed portions of loans, net 119 227 (108) (47.6) Swap fee income/capital markets revenue 41,309 60,992 (19,683) (32.3) Securities gains (losses), net (88) 88 (100.0) Earnings on bank-owned life insurance 2,056 1,838 218 11.9 Debit card fees 5,459 4,216 1,243 29.5 Correspondent banking fees 967 1,114 (147) (13.2) Loan related fee income 2,428 2,268 160 7.1 Fair value gain (loss) on derivatives 1,975 170 1,805 1061.8 Other 1,372 3,870 (2,498) (64.5) Total noninterest income 80,729 100,422 (19,693) (19.6) In recent years, the Company has been successful in expanding its wealth management customer base. Trust fees continue to be a significant contributor to noninterest income. Assets under management decreased by 842.4 million in 2022 due 
 40 

Table of Contents 
 to market volatility. Income is generated primarily from fees charged based on assets under administration for corporate and personal trusts and for custodial services. The majority of the trust fees are determined based on the value of the investments within the fully-managed trusts. Trust fees decreased 5 in 2022 as compared to 2021 due to market volatility. The Company expects trust fees to be negatively impacted during periods of significantly lower market valuations and positively impacted during periods of significantly higher market valuation. Investment advisory and management fees decreased 5 in 2022 as compared to 2021. Similar to trust fees, fees from these services are largely determined based on the value of the investments managed. As a result, fee income from this line of business fluctuates with market valuations. Deposit service fees increased 33 in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to the GFED acquisition. The Company continues to emphasize shifting the mix of deposits from retail time deposits to non-maturity demand deposits across all its markets. With this continuing shift in mix, the Company has increased the number of demand deposit accounts, which tend to be lower in interest cost and higher in-service fees. The Company plans to continue this shift in mix and to further focus on growing deposit service fees. Gains on sales of residential real estate loans, net, decreased 45 in 2022 as compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily due to decreased residential real estate purchases and the refinancing of residential real estate loans with higher interest rates in 2022. The Company s gains on the sale of government-guaranteed portions of loans for 2022 decreased 48 as compared to 2021. Over the past few years, competitors have been offering SBA and USDA loan candidates traditional financing without such a guarantee and the Company is not willing to relax its structure for those lending opportunities. The Company has grown its interest rate swap program significantly over the past several years. The Company s interest rate swap program consists of back-to-back interest rate swaps with two types of commercial borrowers: (1) traditional commercial loans of a certain minimum size and sophistication, and (2) LIHTC permanent loans. Most of the growth has been in the latter category as the Company has grown relationships with strong LIHTC developers with many years of experience. The LIHTC industry is strong and growing with an increased need for affordable housing. The interest rate swaps allow the commercial borrowers to pay a fixed interest rate while the Company receives a variable interest rate as well as an upfront nonrefundable fee dependent upon the pricing. Swap fee income/capital markets revenue totaled 41.3 million in 2022 as compared to 61.0 million in 2021. The decrease was due to delays in client projects caused by ongoing supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures and higher interest rates. Swap fee income relative to the increase in notional amount of the non-hedging interest rate swap contracts was 8.2 in 2022 and 9.9 in 2021. The decrease in the ratio was primarily due to the steepening of the yield curve. In the traditional commercial portfolio, the pricing is more competitive and the duration is shorter as compared to the LIHTC permanent loans. The mix of loans with interest rate swaps continued to be heavily weighted towards LIHTC permanent loans. Future levels of swap fee income are dependent upon the needs of our traditional commercial and LIHTC borrowers, and the size of the related nonrefundable swap fee may fluctuate depending on the interest rate environment. There were no securities gains or losses in 2022. Securities losses, net of gains totaled 88 thousand in 2021. Earnings on BOLI increased 12 in 2022. There were 10.0 million of purchases of BOLI in 2022 and there were no purchases of BOLI in 2021. Yields on BOLI (based on a simple average and excluding the impact of the federal income tax exemption) were 1.92 for 2022 and 2.94 for 2021. Notably, a portion of the Company s BOLI is variable rate whereby the returns are determined by the performance of the equity markets. Management intends to continue to review its BOLI investments to be consistent with policy and regulatory limits in conjunction with the rest of its earning assets in an effort to maximize returns while minimizing risk. Debit card fees are the interchange fees paid on certain debit card customer transactions. Debit card fees increased 30 in 2022. The increase was primarily due to the GFED acquisition. These fees can vary based on customer debit card usage, so fluctuations from period to period may occur. As an opportunity to maximize fees, the Company offers a deposit product with a higher interest rate that incentivizes debit card activity. Correspondent banking fees decreased 13 in 2022 due to higher earnings credits as the Federal Reserve increased rates continually in 2022. The fees are generally included in the earnings credit rates which incent the correspondent bank to maintain higher levels of noninterest bearing deposits to offset the correspondent banking fees. Management will continue 
 41 

Table of Contents 
 to evaluate earnings credit rates and the resulting impact on deposit balances and fees while balancing the ability to grow market share. Correspondent banking continues to be a core strategy for the Company, as this line of business provides a high level of noninterest bearing deposits that can be used to fund loan growth as well as a steady source of fee income. The Company now serves 185 banks in Iowa, Illinois, Missouri and Wisconsin. Loan related fee income increased 7 in 2022. The increase was primarily due to the increase in loan volume with the GFED acquisition. Fair value gain (loss) on derivatives increased 1062 in 2022. The increase was due to the rapidly rising interest rate environment. The Company uses cap instruments to manage interest rate risk related to the variability of interest payments due to changes in interest rates. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Other noninterest income decreased 65 in 2022 primarily due to lower equity investment income and lower gains on disposal of leased assets. NONINTEREST EXPENSES The following tables set forth the various categories of noninterest expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 Change Change (dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee benefits 115,368 100,907 14,461 14.3 Occupancy and equipment expense 21,975 15,918 6,057 38.1 Professional and data processing fees 16,282 14,579 1,703 11.7 Acquisition costs 3,715 624 3,091 495.4 Post-acquisition compensation, transition and integration costs 5,526 5,526 100.0 Disposition costs 13 (13) (100.0) FDIC insurance, other insurance and regulatory fees 5,806 4,475 1,331 29.7 Loan/lease expense 1,829 1,671 158 9.5 Net cost of (income from) and gains/losses on operations of other real estate (40) (1,420) 1,380 (97.2) Advertising and marketing 4,958 4,254 704 16.5 Communication and data connectivity 2,213 1,798 415 23.1 Supplies 1,109 1,053 56 5.3 Bank service charges 2,282 2,173 109 5.0 Correspondent banking expense 840 799 41 5.1 Intangibles amortization 2,854 2,032 822 40.5 Payment card processing 1,964 1,412 552 39.1 Trust expense 775 758 17 2.2 Other 2,560 2,656 (96) (3.6) Total noninterest expense 190,016 153,702 36,314 23.6 Management places strong emphasis on overall cost containment and is committed to improving the Company s general efficiency. One-time charges relating to acquisitions and post-acquisition compensation, transition and integration cost impacted expense in 2022. Salaries and employee benefits, which is the largest component of noninterest expense, increased 14 in 2022 as compared to 2021. This increase was primarily related to the GFED acquisition, which resulted in an increase of 165 full-time equivalent employees. Occupancy and equipment expense increased 38 in 2022 as compared to 2021. This increase was due to higher depreciation expense and computer hardware expense related to the GFED acquisition. Professional and data processing fees increased 12 in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to the GFED acquisition. Generally, professional and data processing fees can fluctuate depending on certain one-time project costs. Management will continue to focus on minimizing such one-time costs and driving recurring costs down through contract negotiation or managed reduction in activity where costs are determined on a usage basis.

Table of Contents 
 Acquisition costs totaled 3.7 million in 2022 and 624 thousand in 2021. These costs were comprised of primarily legal, accounting and other professional fees related to the GFED acquisition described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Post-acquisition compensation, transition and integration costs totaled 5.5 million in 2022. There were no post-acquisition compensation, transition and integration costs in 2021. These costs were comprised primarily of personnel costs, IT integration, and conversion costs related to the acquisition of GFED. There were no disposition costs in 2022. Disposition costs totaled 13 thousand for 2021. The costs were comprised primarily of legal, accounting, disposal of fixed assets and prepaids, personnel costs and IT deconversion costs related to the sale of the Bates Companies. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. FDIC insurance, other insurance and regulatory fee expense increased 30 in 2022. The increase in expense was due to the GFED acquisition as well as an increase in the asset size of the Company in 2022 which increased the Company s insurance rates and expenses. Loan/lease expense increased 10 in 2022 as compared to 2021. Generally, loan/lease expense has a direct relationship with the level of NPLs; however, it may deviate depending upon the individual NPLs. Net cost of (income from) and gains/losses on operations of other real estate includes gains/losses on the sale of OREO, write-downs of OREO and all income/expenses associated with OREO. Net income from operations totaled 40 thousand for 2022 as compared to net income of operations of 1.4 million for 2021. The higher amount in 2021 is due primarily to the gain on sale of a large property. Advertising and marketing expense increased 17 in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase in expense was primarily due to the return to more normal operations during the second half of 2021 and the full year of 2022 in response to improvements in the general economic environment due to COVID-19 as well as the GFED acquisition. Communication and data connectivity expense increased 23 in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase is primarily due to the GFED acquisition. Supplies expense increased 5 in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase is primarily due to the GFED acquisition. Bank service charges, a large portion of which includes indirect costs incurred to provide services to QCBT s correspondent banking customer portfolio, increased 5 in 2022 as compared to 2021. As transaction volumes continue to increase and the number of correspondent banking clients increases, the associated expenses is expected to also increase. Correspondent banking expense increased 5 in 2022 as compared to 2021. These are direct costs incurred to provide services to QCBT s correspondent banking customer portfolio, including safekeeping and cash management services. Intangible amortization expense increased 41 in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase is due to the GFED acquisition. These expenses naturally decrease as intangibles become fully amortized unless there is an addition to intangible assets. Payment card processing expense increased 39 in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase is due to the GFED acquisition. Trust expense increased 2 in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was due to new relationships added in 2022 totaling 481.0 million of new assets under management. Other noninterest expense decreased 4 in 2022 as compared to 2021. The decrease was due primarily to losses on disposal of fixed assets no longer in service. Also included in other noninterest expense are other items such as subscriptions, sales and use tax and expenses related to wealth management.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021 OVERVIEW Following is a table that represents the major categories of the Company s balance sheet.

The Company s securities portfolio increased 117.9 million, or 15 , during 2022. The Company s loan/lease portfolio increased 1.5 billion, or 32 , during 2022. Deposits grew 1.1 billion, or 22 , during 2022. Borrowings increased 655.1 million, or 384 , during 2022. The increases were primarily due to the GFED acquisition and strong growth. INVESTMENT SECURITIES The composition of the Company s securities portfolio is managed to meet liquidity needs while prioritizing the impact on interest rate risk and maximizing return, while minimizing credit risk. Over the recent years, the Company has continued to change the mix of the portfolio by decreasing U.S government sponsored agency securities, while increasing residential mortgage-backed and related securities and tax-exempt municipal securities. Of the latter, the large majority are privately placed tax-exempt debt issuances by municipalities located in the Midwest (with some in or near the Company s existing markets) that require a thorough underwriting process before investment and are generated by our specialty finance group. Following is a breakdown of the Company s securities portfolio by type, the percentage of net unrealized gains (losses) to carrying value on the total portfolio, and the portfolio duration as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

As a result, the Company s net unrealized gains as a percentage for amortized cost changed from 7.17 as of December 31, 2021 to a net unrealized loss as a percentage of amortized cost of (11.26) as of December 31, 2022. The Company has not invested in non-agency commercial or residential mortgage-backed securities or pooled trust preferred securities. The following is a breakdown of the weighted-average yield for each range of maturities by category of debt securities that are not held at fair value:

The weighted-average yield is calculated by dividing the total interest for each security per maturity range by the total amortized cost within that maturity range. Yields are not computed on a tax equivalent basis. There have been no major changes within the tax-exempt portfolio. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company s investment securities. LOANS/LEASES Total loans/leases grew 31.2 in 2022 over 2021. Total loans/leases, excluding acquired and PPP loans (non-GAAP) grew 14.6 in 2022 over 2021. The mix of loan/lease types within the Company s loan/lease portfolio is presented in the following tables.

For example, management tracks the level of owner-occupied CRE loans relative to non-owner-occupied loans because owner-occupied loans are generally considered to have less risk. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 16 of the CRE loan portfolio was owner-occupied. Historically, the Company structures most residential real estate loans to conform to the underwriting requirements of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to allow the subsidiary banks to resell the loans on the secondary market to avoid the interest rate risk associated with longer term fixed rate loans and recognizing noninterest income from the gain on sale. Loans originated for this purpose were classified as held for sale and are included in the residential real estate loans in the table above. Historically, the subsidiary banks structure most loans that will not conform to those underwriting requirements as adjustable-rate mortgages that mature or adjust in one to five years, and then retain these loans in their portfolios. The Company holds a limited amount of 15-year fixed rate residential real estate loans originated in prior years that met certain credit guidelines. In addition, the Company has not originated any subprime, Alt-A, no documentation, or stated income residential real estate loans throughout its history. The following tables set forth the remaining maturities by loan/lease type as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Maturities are based on contractual dates.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LOANS/LEASES AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES The adequacy of the ACL was determined by management based on factors that included the overall composition of the loan/lease portfolio, types of loans/leases, historical loss experience, loan/lease delinquencies, potential substandard and doubtful credits, economic conditions, collateral positions, government guarantees and other factors that, in management s judgment, deserved evaluation. To ensure that an adequate ACL was maintained, provisions were made based on a number of factors, including the increase in loans/leases and a detailed analysis of the loan/lease portfolio. The loan/lease portfolio is reviewed and analyzed quarterly with specific detailed reviews completed on all credits risk-rated less than fair quality as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and carrying aggregate exposure in excess of 250 thousand. The adequacy of the allowance is monitored by the credit administration staff and reported to management and the board of directors. Changes in the ACL for loans/leases for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are presented as follows:

The Company recorded negative 1.3 million of provision for credit losses related to OBS exposures. Negative provision is due to increased line of credit usage resulting in lower exposure, offset by Day 2 provision related to the acquisition of GFED of 1.4 million. At December 31, 2022, the allowance for OBS exposures was 5.6 million. The following is a table that reports the criticized and classified loan totals as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Classified loans are defined as C I and CRE loans with internally assigned risk ratings of 7 or 8, regardless of performance. Criticized loans increased 42 and classified loans increased 24 in 2022 as compared to 2021. Increases are due to the acquisition of GFED. The Company continues its strong focus on improving credit quality in an effort to limit NPLs.

Leases represent 1 of to total loans/leases. Although management believes that the ACL for loans/leases at December 31, 2022 is at a level adequate to absorb losses on existing loans/leases, there can be no assurance that such losses will not exceed the estimated amounts or that the Company will not be required to make additional provisions in the future. Unpredictable future events could adversely affect cash flows for both commercial and individual borrowers, which could cause the Company to experience increases in problem assets, delinquencies and losses on loans/leases, and may require additional increases in the provision for credit losses. Asset quality is a priority for the Company and its subsidiaries. The ability to grow profitably is in part dependent upon the ability to maintain that quality. The Company continually focuses efforts at its subsidiary banks and its leasing company with the intention to improve the overall quality of the Company s loan/lease portfolio. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company s ACL. NONPERFORMING ASSETS The table below presents the amounts of NPAs and related ratios.

NPAs at December 31, 2022 were 8.9 million, up 6.1 million from December 31, 2021. The increase from prior year was primarily the result of the GFED acquisition. The ratio of NPAs to total assets was 0.11 at December 31, 2022, up from 0.05 at December 31, 2021. The majority of the Company s NPAs consists of nonaccrual loans/leases. For nonaccrual loans/leases, management thoroughly reviewed these loans/leases and provided specific allowances as appropriate.

Table of Contents 
 OREO is carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. The policy of the Company is to place a loan/lease on nonaccrual status if: (a) payment in full of interest or principal is not expected; or (b) principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the obligation is both in the process of collection and well secured. A loan/lease is well secured if it is secured by collateral with sufficient market value to repay principal and all accrued interest. A debt is in the process of collection if collection of the debt is proceeding in due course either through legal action, including judgment enforcement procedures, or in appropriate circumstances, through collection efforts not involving legal action which are reasonably expected to result in repayment of the debt or in its restoration to current status. The Company s lending/leasing practices remain unchanged and asset quality remains a top priority for management. DEPOSITS Deposits grew 1.1 billion, or 21.6 , during 2022, primarily due to an increase in both non-interest bearing and interest-bearing deposits with the GFED acquisition. The table below presents the composition of the Company s deposit portfolio. 

As of December 31, 2022 2021 Amount Amount (dollars in thousands) Noninterest bearing demand deposits 1,262,981 21 1,268,788 26 Interest bearing demand deposits 3,875,497 65 3,232,633 65 Time deposits 744,593 12 421,348 9 Brokered deposits 101,146 2 3 5,984,217 100 4,922,772 100 Deposit balances can fluctuate a great deal due to large customer and correspondent bank activity. During recent years, the Company had significant core deposit growth mostly from its correspondent banking clients. The Company s correspondent bank deposit portfolio and funds managed consists of the following: Noninterest-bearing deposits which represent the correspondent banks operating cash used for processing transactions with the Federal Reserve, Money market deposits which represent some excess liquidity, and EBA balances of the correspondent banks at the FRB. Generally, the Company can modify the structure and interest rates paid for those correspondent bank deposits on the balance sheet which are the noninterest bearing deposits and the money market deposits. This has led to more of the correspondent bank portfolio s excess liquidity to shift to the EBAs at the FRB, which is managed by the Company, but is off the Company s balance sheet. On average, over the past two years, the correspondent banks EBA ranges from 800 million to 1.5 billion which is approximately 500 million more than pre-pandemic levels. In the second half of 2022, the Company s correspondent bank deposit portfolio shifted to more normalized levels of liquidity and the related deposits on and off the Company s balance sheet. The Company had total uninsured deposits of 1.6 billion and 1.9 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively. The table below represents the time deposits in FDIC uninsured accounts by maturity: 

As of December 31, 2022 2021 (dollars in thousands) U.S. Time Deposits in Amounts in Excess of FDIC insurance limit: One to three months 183,837 61,278 Three to six months 113,065 45,451 Six to twelve months 118,311 81,290 Over twelve months 27,441 37,038 442,654 225,058

 There were no other time deposits otherwise uninsured. The Company had no deposits by foreign depositors in domestic offices as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Management will continue to focus on growing its core deposit portfolio, including its correspondent banking business at QCBT, as well as shifting the mix from brokered and other higher cost deposits to lower cost core deposits. With the significant success achieved by QCBT in growing its correspondent banking business, QCBT has developed procedures to proactively monitor this industry concentration of deposits and loans. Other deposit-related industry concentrations and large accounts are monitored by the internal asset liability management committee. See discussion regarding policy limits on bank stock loans in the Lending/Leasing section under Item 1 Business in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS The subsidiary banks purchase federal funds for short-term funding needs from the FRB or from their correspondent banks. The table below presents the composition of the Company s short-term borrowings. 

As of December 31, 2022 2021 (dollars in thousands) Federal funds purchased 129,630 3,800 The Company s federal funds purchased fluctuates based on the short-term funding needs of the Company s subsidiary banks. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company s short-term borrowings. FHLB ADVANCES AND OTHER BORROWINGS As a result of their membership in the FHLB of Des Moines, the subsidiary banks have the ability to borrow funds for short-term or long-term purposes under a variety of programs. The subsidiary banks can utilize FHLB advances for loan matching as a hedge against the possibility of changing interest rates or when these advances provide a less costly or more readily available source of funds than customer deposits. 

As of December 31, 2022 2021 (dollars in thousands) FHLB Advances 415,000 15,000 Weighted Average Interest Rate at Year-End 4.58 0.31 It is management s intention to reduce its reliance on wholesale funding, including FHLB advances and brokered deposits. Replacement of this funding with core deposits helps to reduce interest expense as wholesale funding tends to be higher cost. However, the Company may choose to utilize advances and/or brokered deposits to supplement funding needs, as this is a way for the Company to effectively and efficiently manage interest rate risk. The Company renewed its revolving credit note in the second quarter of 2022. At renewal, the available line amount was increased from 25.0 million to 50.0 million. Interest on the revolving line of credit was calculated at the greater of: (a) the effective Prime Rate less 0.50 and (b) 3.00 per annum. The collateral on the revolving line of credit is 100 of the outstanding stock of the Company s bank subsidiaries. There was no outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit at December 31, 2022. See Notes 10 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding FHLB advances and other borrowings. SUBORDINATED NOTES The Company had subordinated notes totaling 232.7 million and 113.9 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company completed private placements of 100.0 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity measures the ability of the Company to meet maturing obligations and its existing commitments, to withstand fluctuations in deposit levels, to fund its operations, and to provide for customers credit needs. The Company monitors liquidity risk through contingency planning stress testing on a regular basis. The Company seeks to avoid over concentration of funding sources and to establish and maintain contingent funding facilities that can be drawn upon if normal funding sources become unavailable. One source of liquidity is cash and short-term assets, such as interest-bearing deposits in other banks, cash and due from banks and federal funds sold, which averaged 153.9 million and 178.7 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company s on balance sheet liquidity position can fluctuate based on short-term activity in deposits and loans. The subsidiary banks have a variety of sources of short-term liquidity available to them, including federal funds purchased from correspondent banks, FHLB advances, wholesale structured repurchase agreements, brokered deposits, lines of credit, borrowing at the Federal Reserve Discount Window, sales of securities AFS, and loan/lease participations or sales. The Company also generates liquidity from the regular principal payments and prepayments made on its loan/lease portfolio, and on the regular monthly payments on its securities portfolio. At December 31, 2022, the subsidiary banks had 28 lines of credit totaling 501.8 million, of which 31.0 million was secured and 470.8 million was unsecured. At December 31, 2022, 372.8 million was available. At December 31, 2021, the subsidiary banks had 31 lines of credit totaling 517.7 million, of which 61.7 million was secured and 456.0 million was unsecured. At December 31, 2021, all of the 517.7 million was available. The Company has emphasized growing the number and amount of lines of credit in an effort to strengthen this contingent source of liquidity. Additionally, the Company maintains a 50.0 million secured revolving credit note with a variable interest rate and a maturity of June 30, 2023. At December 31, 2022, the full 50.0 million was available. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 576.8 million in average correspondent banking deposits spread over 185 relationships. While the Company believes that these funds are relatively stable, there is the potential for large fluctuations that can impact liquidity. Seasonality and the liquidity needs of these correspondent banks can impact balances. Management closely monitors these fluctuations and runs stress scenarios to measure the impact on liquidity and interest rate risk with various levels of correspondent deposit run-off. Investing activities used cash of 634.7 million during 2022 compared to 411.8 million during 2021. Proceeds from calls, maturities, pay downs, and sales of securities were 186.8 million for 2022 compared to 195.7 million for 2021. Purchases of securities used cash of 230.5 million for 2022 compared to 173.2 million for 2021. The net increase in loans/leases used cash of 654.9 million for 2022 compared to 433.5 million for 2021. Financing activities provided cash of 538.2 million for 2022 compared to 299.7 million for 2021. Net decreases in deposits totaled 15.1 million for 2022 as compared to net increases of 323.6 million for 2021. Net short-term borrowings

 increased 125.8 million for 2022 and decreased 1.6 million for 2021. In 2021 the Company used 5.0 million to prepay select subordinated notes. Short-term FHLB advances increased 400.0 million in 2022. Proceeds from subordinated notes totaled 100.0 million in 2022. Repurchase and cancellation of shares totaled 53.0 million in 2022 as compared to 14.2 million in 2021. Total cash provided by operating activities was 118.7 million for 2022 compared to 88.2 million for 2021. Throughout its history, the Company has secured additional capital through various resources, including common and preferred stock and the issuance of trust preferred securities and subordinated notes. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the subsidiary banks remained well-capitalized in accordance with regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking authorities. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detail of the capital amounts and ratios for the Company and its subsidiary banks. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In the normal course of business, the subsidiary banks make various commitments and incur certain contingent liabilities that are not presented in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. The commitments and contingent liabilities include various guarantees, commitments to extend credit, and standby letters of credit. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The subsidiary banks evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the banks upon extension of credit, is based upon management s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, marketable securities, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the subsidiary banks to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements and, generally, have terms of one year or less. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The banks hold collateral, as described above, supporting those commitments if deemed necessary. In the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party, the banks would be required to fund the commitments. The maximum potential amount of future payments the banks could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount. If the commitment is funded, the banks would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, no amounts had been recorded as liabilities for the banks potential obligations under these guarantees. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, commitments to extend credit aggregated 1.7 billion and 1.2 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, standby letters of credit aggregated 25.8 million and 21.7 million, respectively. Management does not expect that all of these commitments will be funded. Additional information regarding commitments, contingencies, and off-balance sheet arrangements is described in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has various financial obligations, including contractual obligations and commitments, which may require future cash payments. The significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties are deposits without a stated maturity, certificates of deposit, short-term borrowings, subordinated notes, and junior subordinated debentures and totaled 6.8 billion as of December 31, 2022. The Company s operating contract obligations represent short and long-term contractual payments for data processing equipment and services, software, and other equipment and professional services and totaled 56.6 million as of December 31, 2022.

 IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and the accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the Company s operations. Unlike industrial companies, nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the Company are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on the Company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This document (including information incorporated by reference) contains, and future oral and written statements of the Company and its management may contain, forward-looking statements, within the meaning of such term in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, with respect to the financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business of the Company. Forward-looking statements, which may be based upon beliefs, expectations and assumptions of the Company s management and on information currently available to management, are generally identifiable by the use of words such as believe, expect, anticipate, bode, predict, suggest, project, appear, plan, intend, estimate, annualize, may, will, would, could, should, likely, might, potential, continue, annualized, target, outlook, as well as the negative forms of those words, or other similar expressions. Additionally, all statements in this document, including forward-looking statements, speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any statement in light of new information or future events. The Company s ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. The factors that could have a material adverse effect on the operations and future prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries are detailed in the Risk Factors section included under Item 1A. of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to the risk factors described in that section, there are other factors that could have a material adverse effect on the operations and future prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries. These additional factors include, but are not limited to, the following: The strength of the local, state, national and international economies (including effects of inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints). The economic impact of any future terrorist threats and attacks, widespread disease or pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States), acts of war or threats thereof (including the Russian invasion of Ukraine), or other adverse events that could cause economic deterioration or instability in credit markets, and the response of the local, state and national governments to any such adverse external events. Changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by state and federal regulatory agencies, the FASB, the SEC or the PCAOB. Changes in state and federal laws, regulations and governmental policies concerning the Company s general business. Changes in the interest rates and prepayment rates of the Company s assets (including the impact of LIBOR phase-out). Increased competition in the financial services sector, including from non-bank competitors such as credit unions and fintech companies, and the inability to attract new customers. Changes in technology and the ability to develop and maintain secure and reliable electronic systems. Unexpected results of acquisitions which may include failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions and the possibility that transaction costs may be greater than anticipated. The loss of key executives and employees.

 Changes in consumer spending. Unexpected outcomes of existing or new litigation involving the Company. The economic impact of exceptional weather occurrences such as tornadoes, floods and blizzards. Fluctuations in the value of securities held in our securities portfolio. Concentrations within our loan portfolio, large loans to certain borrowers, and large deposits from certain clients. The level of non-performing assets on our balance sheets. Interruptions involving our information technology and communications systems or third-party servicers. Breaches or failures of our information security controls or cybersecurity-related incidents. The ability of the Company to manage the risks associated with the foregoing as well as anticipated. 
 These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, like other financial institutions, is subject to direct and indirect market risk. Direct market risk exists from changes in interest rates. The Company s net income is dependent on its net interest income. Net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the degree that interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis than interest-earning assets. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest-earning assets in a given period, a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net interest income. In an attempt to manage the Company s exposure to changes in interest rates, management monitors the Company s interest rate risk. Each subsidiary bank has an asset/liability management committee of its board of directors that meets quarterly to review the bank s interest rate risk position and profitability, and to make or recommend adjustments, as necessary, for consideration by the full board of each bank. Internal asset/liability management teams consisting of members of the subsidiary banks management meet bi-weekly to manage the mix of assets and liabilities to maximize earnings and liquidity and minimize interest rate and other risks. Management also reviews the subsidiary banks securities portfolios, formulates investment strategies, and oversees the timing and implementation of transactions to assure attainment of the board s objectives in the most effective manner. Notwithstanding the Company s interest rate risk management activities, the potential for changing interest rates is an uncertainty that can have an adverse effect on net income. In adjusting the Company s asset/liability position, the Board of Directors and management attempt to manage the Company s interest rate risk while maintaining or enhancing net interest margins. At times, depending on the level of general interest rates, the relationship between long-term and short-term interest rates, market conditions and competitive factors, the Board of Directors and management may decide to increase the Company s interest rate risk position somewhat in order to increase its net interest margin. The Company s results of operations and net portfolio values remain vulnerable to increases in interest rates and to fluctuations in the difference between long-term and short-term interest rates. One method used to quantify interest rate risk is a short-term earnings at risk summary, which is a detailed and dynamic simulation model used to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes. This simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid

 on all interest sensitive assets and liabilities reflected on the Company s consolidated balance sheet. This sensitivity analysis demonstrates net interest income exposure annually over a five-year horizon, assuming no balance sheet growth, no balance sheet mix change, and various interest rate scenarios including no change in rates; 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis point upward shifts; and 100 and 200 basis point downward shifts in interest rates, where interest-bearing assets and liabilities reprice at their earliest possible repricing date. The model assumes parallel and pro rata shifts in interest rates over a twelve-month period for the 200 basis point upward shift and 100 and 200 basis point downward shifts. For the 400 basis point upward shift, the model assumes a parallel and pro rata shift in interest rates over a twenty-four month period. Further, in recent years, the Company added additional interest rate scenarios where interest rates experience a parallel and instantaneous shift shock upward of 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis points and a parallel and instantaneous shock downward of 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points. The Company will run additional interest rate scenarios on an as-needed basis. The asset/liability management committees of the subsidiary bank boards of directors have established policy limits of a 10 decline in net interest income for the 200 basis point upward parallel shift, the 100 basis point downward parallel shift and the 200 basis point downward parallel shift. For the 300 basis point upward shock and 300 basis point downward shock, the established policy limit is a 30 decline in net interest income. The increased policy limit is appropriate as the shock scenario is extreme and unlikely and warrants a higher limit than the more realistic and traditional parallel/pro-rata shift scenarios. Application of the simulation model analysis for select interest rate scenarios at December 31, 2022 and 2021 demonstrated the following: 

NET INTEREST INCOME EXPOSURE in YEAR 1 As of December 31, As of December 31, INTEREST RATE SCENARIO POLICY LIMIT 2022 2021 300 basis point downward shock (30.0) (6.1) n/a 200 basis point downward shift (10.0) (0.2) n/a 100 basis point downward shift (10.0) 0.2 (0.1) 200 basis point upward shift (10.0) (1.3) 3.1 300 basis point upward shock (30.0) (2.3) 11.6 Despite the shift in model results to a more neutral position, the Company remains moderately asset sensitive. Management is conservative with the repricing assumptions on loans and deposits. For example, management does not model any delay in deposit betas despite historical experience and practice of delays in deposit betas. Finally, management models a variety of scenarios including some that stress key assumptions to help capture and isolate the impact of the management s more conservative approach to the assumptions in the base model. The simulation is within the board-established policy limits for all three scenarios. Additionally, for all of the various interest rate scenarios modeled and measured by management (as described above), the results at December 31, 2022 were well within established risk tolerances as established by policy or by best practice (if the interest rate scenario didn t have a specific policy limit). Interest rate risk is considered to be one of the most significant market risks affecting the Company. For that reason, the Company engages the assistance of a national consulting firm and its risk management system to monitor and control the Company s interest rate risk exposure. Other types of market risk, such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk, do not arise in the normal course of the Company s business activities.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of QCR Holdings, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of QCR Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013, and our report dated March 1, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases As described in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases (allowance) totaled 87.7 million at December 31, 2022. The allowance is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist (general reserve). Loans that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis at the balance sheet date (specific reserve). At December 31, 2022 the general reserve on loans and leases collectively evaluated for impairment totaled 80.8 million and the specific reserve on loans and leases individually evaluated totaled 6.9 million. The measurement of the general reserve is based on relevant past events, including historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectability. The Company s reserve on collectively evaluated loans and leases includes a quantitative allowance based upon estimates of losses over the life of the loans and leases that is calculated using an existing probability of default and loss given default framework, as well as a qualitative component for factors not reflected in the historical loss experience. The qualitative component is determined based on an assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality at the present time (qualitative factors), as well as a projection of the impact in the future (future factors). Qualitative factors of significant influence include the general economic environment in the Company s markets, both locally and nationally, as well as the impact of economic conditions on certain industries and credit quality indicators. The Company s future factors represent an estimate of forecasted economic conditions. The calculation also contemplates that the Company may not have sufficient information to make reasonable and supportable forecasts for the entire life of the loans and leases, which would result in a reversion to historical credit loss information. The evaluation of these qualitative factors and future factors requires that management make significant judgments, which may significantly impact the estimated allowance. We identified the qualitative and future factors applied to the general reserve of the allowance as a critical audit matter, as auditing management s determination of the qualitative and future factors required significant auditor judgement as amounts determined by management rely on analysis that is highly subjective and includes significant estimation uncertainty. Our audit procedures related to the Company s qualitative factors and future factors in the general reserve included the following, among others: We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to the qualitative and future factors of the general reserve and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness, including controls relating to management s review and approval of the qualitative and future factors and the underlying data used in determining those factors. We tested management s process and evaluated the reasonableness of their judgments and assumptions to develop the qualitative and future factors, which included: - Testing the accuracy and relevancy of the data inputs used by management as a basis for the adjustments for qualitative and future factors by comparing to internal and external source data.

 - Evaluating the magnitude and directional consistency of the adjustments. - Evaluating whether management s conclusions were consistent with Company provided internal data and external, independently sourced data and agreeing the impact to the allowance calculation. Business Combination Fair Value of Acquired Loans As described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, on April 1, 2022, the Company completed its acquisition of Guaranty Federal Bancshares (GFED). The Company recorded 63.5 million of goodwill as a result of the acquisition, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired using the acquisition method of accounting. As part of the acquisition, the Company acquired 801.7 million in loans. Acquired loans are initially recorded at their acquisition-date fair values. The Company prepared loan fair value adjustments that it believed a market participant might employ in estimating the fair value for the acquired loan portfolio. This analysis was performed for loans with signs of credit deterioration (purchase credit deteriorated loans (PCD)) as well as those without signs of credit deterioration (non-PCD loans). The acquired non-PCD loan portfolio was recorded at an estimated fair value of 770.3 million at the acquisition date without carryover of GFED s previously established allowance. We identified the fair value of acquired non-PCD loans as a critical audit matter, because of the judgments necessary to determine the fair value of the loans, the high degree of auditor judgment involved and the extensive audit effort involved in testing management estimates and assumptions, including the use of valuation specialists. Our audit procedures related to the valuation of the acquired non-PCD loan portfolio included the following, among others: 
 We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to the business combination, including the valuation of the acquired non-PCD loan portfolio and management s development of significant assumptions, and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness. We obtained management s valuation report and tested the completeness and accuracy of data inputs including non-PCD loan balances and interest rates utilized in the calculation. We utilized internal valuation specialists to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of the valuation methodology applied on non-PCD loans and significant assumptions utilized in management s determination of fair value such as yield curves, prepayment rates, expected losses, recovery periods and discount rates.

Interest is credited to earnings as earned based on the principal amount outstanding. Deferred direct loan origination fees and/or costs are amortized as an adjustment of the related loan s yield. As assets held for and used in the production of services, the origination and collection of these loans are classified as investing activities in the statement of cash flows. The ACL is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. The Company discloses the ACL (also known as the allowance) by portfolio segment, and credit quality information, nonaccrual status, and past due status by class of financing receivable. A portfolio segment is the level at which the Company develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine its ACL. A class of financing receivable is a further disaggregation of a portfolio segment based on risk characteristics and the Company s method for monitoring and assessing credit risk. See the following information and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company s portfolio segments are as follows: C I revolving C I - other CRE owner occupied CRE non-owner occupied Construction and land development Multi-family 1-4 family real estate Consumer

 to of the cost of the related equipment), are recorded as lease receivables when the lease is signed and the lease property delivered to the customer. The excess of the minimum lease payments and residual values over the cost of the equipment is recorded as unearned lease income. Unearned lease income is recognized over the term of the lease on a basis that results in an approximate level rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Lease income is recognized on the interest method. Residual value is the estimated fair market value of the equipment on lease at lease termination. In estimating the equipment s fair value at lease termination, the Company relies on historical experience by equipment type and manufacturer and, where available, valuations by independent appraisers, adjusted for known trends. The Company s estimates are reviewed continuously to ensure reasonableness; however, the amounts the Company will ultimately realize could differ from the estimated amounts. If the review results in a lower estimate than had been previously established, a determination is made as to whether the decline in estimated residual value is other-than-temporary. If the decline in estimated unguaranteed residual value is judged to be other-than-temporary, the accounting for the transaction is revised using the changed estimate. The resulting reduction in the investment is recognized as a loss in the period in which the estimate is changed. An upward adjustment of the estimated residual value is not recorded. The policies for delinquency and nonaccrual for direct financing leases are materially consistent with those described above for all classes of loan receivables.

 portfolio segments at which the allowance will be measured. For all portfolio segments, the allowance is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision that is charged to earnings. Credit losses on loans and leases, for all portfolio segments, are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan/lease balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The Company s methodologies for estimating the ACL consider available relevant information about the collectability of cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The methodologies apply historical loss information adjusted for asset-specific characteristics, economic conditions at the measurement date, and forecasts about future economic conditions that are expected to exist through the contractual lives of the financial assets and that are reasonable and supportable to the identified pools of financial assets with similar risk characteristics for which the historical loss experience was observed. The Company will immediately and fully revert back to average historical losses when it can no longer develop reasonable and supportable forecasts. A discussion of the risk characteristics and the allowance by each portfolio segment follows: For C I loans, the Company focuses on small and mid-sized businesses with primary operations as wholesalers, manufacturers, building contractors, business services companies, other banks, and retailers. The Company provides a wide range of C I loans, including lines of credit for working capital and operational purposes, and term loans for the acquisition of facilities, equipment and other purposes. Approval is generally based on the following factors: Ability and stability of current management of the borrower; Stable earnings with positive financial trends; Sufficient cash flow to support debt repayment; Earnings projections based on reasonable assumptions; Financial strength of the industry and business; and Value and marketability of collateral. 
 Collateral for C I loans generally includes accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. The Company s lending policy specifies approved collateral types and corresponding maximum advance percentages. The value of collateral pledged on loans must exceed the loan amount by a margin sufficient to absorb potential erosion of its value in the event of foreclosure and cover the loan amount plus costs incurred to convert it to cash. The Company s lending policy specifies maximum term limits for C I loans. For term loans, the maximum term is generally with average terms ranging from three to . For lines of credit, the maximum term is generally . In addition, the Company often takes personal guarantees or cosigners to help assure repayment. Loans may be made on an unsecured basis if warranted by the overall financial condition of the borrower. CRE is segmented into the following categories generally based on source of repayment: Owner occupied CRE, non-owner occupied CRE and multi-family. CRE loans are also embedded in the following segments: construction and land development and 1-4 family real estate. The Company is an active lender of LIHTC project loans which includes both the construction and permanent loan. CRE loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar 
 73 

Table of Contents QCR Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
 . The Company s lending policy also includes guidelines for real estate appraisals, including minimum appraisal standards based on certain transactions. In addition, the Company often takes personal guarantees to help assure repayment. Construction loans include any loans to finance the construction of any new residential property, CRE property, low-income housing project or major rehabilitation or expansion of existing commercial structures. Construction lending carries a higher degree of risk because of the difficulty of protecting the bank against various factors. The following components are evaluated when underwriting these types of loans: Borrowers/contractors experience and ability is analyzed with the type and size of project being considered. Financial ability to cover cost overruns. Reliability and thoroughness of cost projections and reasonable assurance that significant provisions are made for contingencies for soft costs especially interest and operating deficits. Reliability of the estimate of time to complete the project. The land development portfolio also includes other land loans such as raw land. The raw land component involves considerable risk to the bank and is reserved for the bank s most credit worthy borrowers. Land development loans are typically only made to experienced local developers with successful track records. For all loans the allowance consists of pooled and individually analyzed components. Pooled loan allowances consist of quantitative and qualitative factors and cover loan classes that share similar risk characteristics with other assets in the segmented pool. Quantitative Factors: The quantitative factors are based on the probability of default and loss given default derived from historical net charge-off experience, repayment activity and default, remaining life, and current economic conditions as well as economic outlook. Qualitative Factors: The Company s allowance methodology also has a qualitative component, the purpose of which is to take into consideration changes in current conditions that are not reflected in the quantitative analysis performed in determining its base credit loss rates. The Company utilizes the following qualitative factors: National and local economy Loan volume and trend Loan quality

 are measured on a case-by-case basis by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the loan s obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.

Table of Contents QCR Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
 are placed into a unique pool and have the overall effective loss rate for that period applied to this low quality pool. However, should an asset within the low quality pool no longer have the same risk characteristic of the unique pool, it will be removed and individually analyzed as described above. Some loans that are determined to no longer share risk characteristics with other assets in the segmented pool, may be deemed collateral dependent. A financial asset is collateral-dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the sale or operation of the collateral. When it is determined that foreclosure is probable, the collateral s fair value is used to estimate the financial assets expected credit losses for the current reporting period. This fair value is then reduced by the present value of estimated costs to sell. If it is determined that the asset is collateral-dependent, but foreclosure is not probable, an institution can elect to apply the practical expedient to use the collateral s fair value to estimate the asset s expected credit loss. The Company is choosing to utilize the practical expedient. When using the practical expedient on a collateral dependent loan where repayment is reliant upon the sale of the collateral, the fair value of that collateral will be adjusted for estimated costs to sell. However, if the repayment is dependent on the operations of the company, the fair market value less estimated cost to sell cannot be used. Thus, the net present value of the cash-flow will be utilized. For non-homogenous loans, the Company utilizes the following internal risk rating scale: 1. Highest Quality (Pass) loans of the highest quality with no credit risk, including those fully secured by subsidiary bank certificates of deposit and U.S. government securities. 2. Superior Quality (Pass) loans with very strong credit quality. Borrowers have exceptionally strong earnings, liquidity, capital, cash flow coverage, and management ability. Includes loans secured by high quality marketable securities, certificates of deposit from other institutions, and cash value of life insurance. Also includes loans supported by U.S. government, state, or municipal guarantees. 3. Satisfactory Quality (Pass) loans with satisfactory credit quality. Established borrowers with satisfactory financial condition, including credit quality, earnings, liquidity, capital and cash flow coverage. Management is capable and experienced. Collateral coverage and guarantor support, if applicable, are more than adequate. Includes loans secured by personal assets and business assets, including equipment, accounts receivable, inventory, and real estate. 4. Fair Quality (Pass) loans with moderate but still acceptable credit quality. The primary repayment source remains adequate; however, management s ability to maintain consistent profitability is unproven or uncertain. Borrowers exhibit acceptable leverage and liquidity. May include new businesses with inexperienced management or unproven performance records in relation to peer, or borrowers operating in highly cyclical or declining industries. 5. Early Warning (Pass) loans where the borrowers have generally performed as agreed, however unfavorable financial trends exist or are anticipated. Earnings may be erratic, with marginal cash flow or declining sales. Borrowers reflect leveraged financial condition and/or marginal liquidity. Management may be new and a track record of performance has yet to be developed. Financial information may be incomplete, and reliance on secondary repayment sources may be increasing. 6. Special Mention loans where the borrowers exhibit credit weaknesses or unfavorable financial trends requiring close monitoring. Weaknesses and adverse trends are more pronounced than Early Warning loans, and if left uncorrected, may jeopardize repayment according to the contractual terms. Currently, no loss of principal or interest is expected. Borrowers in this category have deteriorated to the point that it would be difficult to refinance with another lender. Special Mention should be assigned to borrowers in turnaround

 . 7. Substandard loans which are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if applicable. These loans have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses which jeopardize repayment according to the contractual terms. There is distinct loss potential if the weaknesses are not corrected. Includes loans with insufficient cash flow coverage which are collateral dependent, OREO, and repossessed assets. 8. Doubtful loans which have all the weaknesses inherent in a Substandard loan, with the added characteristic that existing weaknesses make full principal collection, on the basis of current facts, conditions and values, highly doubtful. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of pending factors, recognition of a loss is deferred until a more exact status can be determined. All doubtful loans will be placed on non-accrual, with all payments, including principal and interest, applied to principal reduction 
 For term C I and CRE loans equal to or greater than , the subsidiary banks with an asset size of 1.0 billion or less as of the most recent fiscal year-end require a term loan review within 15 months of the most recent credit review. For the subsidiary banks with an asset size of over 1.0 billion as of the most recent fiscal year-end, a term loan review is required within 15 months of the most recent credit review for term C I and CRE loans of million or more. A credit review encompasses any new debt issuances or renewed debt facilities that are part of the borrower s credit relationship. The term loan/credit review is completed in enough detail to, at a minimum, validate the risk rating. Additionally, the review shall include an analysis of debt service requirements, covenant compliance, if applicable, and collateral adequacy. The frequency of the review is generally accelerated for loans with poor risk ratings. The Company s Loan Quality area performs a documentation review of a sampling of C I and CRE loans, the primary purpose of which is to ensure the credit is properly documented and closed in accordance with approval authorities and conditions. A review is also performed by the Company s Internal Audit Department of a sampling of C I and CRE loans for proper documentation, according to an approved schedule. Validation of the risk rating is also part of Internal Audit s review (performed by Internal Loan Review). Additionally, the Company has contracted an independent outside third party to review a sampling of C I and CRE loans. Validation of the risk rating is part of this review as well. The Company leases machinery and equipment to C I customers under direct financing leases. All lease requests are subject to the credit requirements and criteria as set forth in the lending/leasing policy. In all cases, a formal independent credit analysis of the lessee is performed. Direct financing leases are included in the C I-other segment and allowance is established in the same manner as C I loans. Generally, the Company s residential real estate loans conform to the underwriting requirements of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to allow the subsidiary banks to resell loans in the secondary market. The subsidiary banks structure most loans that will not conform to those underwriting requirements as adjustable rate mortgages that mature or adjust in one to or fixed rate mortgages that mature in , and then retain these loans in their portfolios. Servicing rights are not presently retained on the loans sold in the secondary market. The Company s lending policy establishes minimum appraisal and other credit guidelines. The Company provides many types of installment and other consumer loans including motor vehicle, home improvement, home equity, signature loans and small personal credit lines. The Company s lending policy addresses specific credit guidelines by consumer loan type.

 to to Expected volatility to to Risk-free interest rate to to Expected life of option grants years years years Weighted-average grant date fair value to The Company also uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock purchase grants with the following assumptions for the indicated periods: to to to Expected volatility to to to Risk-free interest rate to to to Expected life of purchase grants 3 to 3 to 3 to Weighted-average grant date fair value The fair value is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods of the grants and will be adjusted for subsequent changes in estimated forfeitures. The expected dividend yield assumption is based on the Company s current expectations about its anticipated dividend policy. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company s common stock price. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option or purchase is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The expected life of the option and purchase grants is derived using the simplified method and represents the period of time that options and purchases are expected to be outstanding. Historical data is used to estimate forfeitures used in the model. Two separate groups of employees (employees subject to broad based grants, and executive employees and directors) are used. As of December 31, 2022, there was thousand of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options granted, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years. The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the quoted price of the Company s common stock for the options that were in-the-money at December 31, 2022. The aggregate intrinsic value at December 31, 2022 was million on options outstanding and million on options exercisable. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised under the Company s stock-based compensation was thousand, thousand, and thousand, respectively, and determined as of the date of the option exercise. Restricted stock awards granted may not be sold or otherwise transferred until the service periods have lapsed. During the vesting periods, participants have voting rights and receive dividends. Upon termination of employment, common shares upon which the service periods have not lapsed must be returned to the Company. All restricted share awards are classified as equity awards. The grant-date fair value of equity-classified restricted stock awards is amortized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the period restrictions lapse. As of December 31, 2022, there was million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock awards expected to be recognized over a period of years.

 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d 15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed and submitted under the Exchange Act was: (1) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures; and (2) recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required. Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting includes controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time. The Company s management has excluded Guaranty Bank from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting from April 1, 2022 through October 10, 2022 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination on April 1, 2022 and its systems merged into the Company s on October 11, 2022. The Company s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. Management s assessment is based on the criteria established in the Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013 and was designed to provide reasonable assurance that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. Based on this assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. RSM US LLP, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, which is included on the following pages of this Form 10-K.

 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ RSM US LLP Davenport, Iowa March 1, 2023

 Appendix A SUPERVISION AND REGULATION General FDIC-insured institutions, their holding companies and their affiliates are extensively regulated under federal and state law. As a result, the growth and earnings performance of the Company may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the requirements of federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including the Iowa Division of Banking, the Missouri Division of Finance, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the CFPB. Furthermore, taxation laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, securities laws administered by the SEC and state securities authorities, and anti-money laundering laws enforced by the Treasury have an impact on the business of the Company. The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and accounting rules are significant to the Company s operations and results. Federal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on the operations of FDIC-insured institutions, their holding companies and affiliates that is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC-insured deposits and depositors of banks, rather than stockholders. These laws, and the regulations of the bank regulatory agencies issued under them, affect, among other things, the scope of the Company s business, the kinds and amounts of investments the Company and the Banks may make, required capital levels relative to assets, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, the ability to merge, consolidate and acquire, dealings with the Company s and the Banks insiders and affiliates and the Company s payment of dividends. In reaction to the global financial crisis and particularly following the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company experienced heightened regulatory requirements and scrutiny. Although the reforms primarily targeted systemically important financial service providers, their influence filtered down in varying degrees to community banks over time and caused the Company s compliance and risk management processes, and the costs thereof, to increase. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 Regulatory Relief Act eliminated questions about the applicability of certain Dodd-Frank Act reforms to community bank systems, including relieving the Company of any requirement to engage in mandatory stress tests, maintain a risk committee or comply with the Volcker Rule s complicated prohibitions on proprietary trading and ownership of private funds. These reforms have been favorable to the Company s operations. The supervisory framework for U.S. banking organizations subjects banks and bank holding companies to regular examination by their respective regulatory agencies, which results in examination reports and ratings that are not publicly available and that can impact the conduct and growth of their business. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. The regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations. The following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to the Company and the Banks. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor does it restate all of the requirements of those that are described. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision.

 The Role of Capital Regulatory capital represents the net assets of a banking organization available to absorb losses. Because of the risks attendant to their business, FDIC-insured institutions generally are required to hold more capital than other businesses, which directly affects the Company s earnings capabilities. Although capital has historically been one of the key measures of the financial health of both bank holding companies and banks, its role became fundamentally more important in the wake of the global financial crisis, as the banking regulators recognized that the amount and quality of capital held by banks prior to the crisis was insufficient to absorb losses during periods of severe stress. Capital Levels. Banks have been required to hold minimum levels of capital based on guidelines established by the bank regulatory agencies since 1983. The minimums have been expressed in terms of ratios of capital divided by total assets. The capital guidelines for U.S. banks beginning in 1989 have been based upon international capital accords (known as Basel rules) adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a committee of central banks and bank supervisors that acts as the primary global standard-setter for prudential regulation, as implemented by the U.S. bank regulatory agencies on an interagency basis. The accords recognized that bank assets for the purpose of the capital ratio calculations needed to be risk weighted (the theory being that riskier assets should require more capital) and that off-balance sheet exposures needed to be factored in the calculations. Following the global financial crisis, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, announced agreement on a strengthened set of capital requirements for banking organizations around the world, known as Basel III, to address deficiencies recognized in connection with the global financial crisis. The Basel III Rule . The United States bank regulatory agencies adopted the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, and, at the same time, effected changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act, in regulations that were effective (with certain phase-ins) in 2015 (the Basel III Rule ). Basel III established capital standards for banks and bank holding companies that are meaningfully more stringent than those in place previously: it increased the required quantity and quality of capital; and it required a more complex, detailed and calibrated assessment of risk in the calculation of risk weightings. The Basel III Rule is applicable to all banking organizations that are subject to minimum capital requirements, including federal and state banks and savings and loan associations, as well as to most bank and savings and loan holding companies. The Company and the Banks are each subject to the Basel III Rule. Not only did the Basel III Rule increase most of the required minimum capital ratios in effect prior to January 1, 2015, but in requiring that forms of capital be of higher quality to absorb loss, it introduced the concept of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, which consists primarily of common stock, related surplus (net of Treasury stock), retained earnings, and Common Equity Tier 1 minority interests subject to certain regulatory adjustments. The Basel III Rule also changed the definition of capital by establishing more stringent criteria that instruments must meet to be considered Additional Tier 1 Capital (primarily non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock that meets certain requirements) and Tier 2 Capital (primarily other types of preferred stock and subordinated debt, subject to limitations). The Basel III Rule also constrained the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, and deferred tax assets in capital and required deductions from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital in the event that such assets exceeded a percentage of a banking institution s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. The Basel III Rule requires minimum capital ratios as follows: A ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital equal to 4.5 of risk-weighted assets; 
 145 

Table of Contents 
 A ratio of Tier 1 Capital equal to 6 of risk-weighted assets; A continuation of the minimum required amount of Total Capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) at 8 of risk-weighted assets; and A leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total quarterly average assets equal to 4 in all circumstances. 
 In addition, institutions that seek the freedom to make capital distributions (including for dividends and repurchases of stock) and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers without restriction must also maintain 2.5 in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to a capital conservation buffer. The purpose of the conservation buffer is to ensure that banking institutions maintain a buffer of capital that can be used to absorb losses during periods of financial and economic stress. Factoring in the conservation buffer increases the minimum ratios depicted above to 7 for Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, 8.5 for Tier 1 Capital and 10.5 for Total Capital. Well-Capitalized Requirements . The ratios described above are minimum standards for banking organizations to be considered adequately capitalized. Bank regulatory agencies uniformly encourage banks to hold more capital and be well-capitalized and, to that end, federal law and regulations provide various incentives for banking organizations to maintain regulatory capital at levels in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. For example, a banking organization that is well-capitalized may: (i) qualify for exemptions from prior notice or application requirements otherwise applicable to certain types of activities; (ii) qualify for expedited processing of other required notices or applications; and (iii) accept, roll-over or renew brokered deposits. Higher capital levels could also be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual banking organizations. For example, the Federal Reserve s capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of, among other things, interest rate risk, or the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading activities. Further, any banking organization experiencing or anticipating significant growth would be expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions i.e. , Tier 1 Capital less all intangible assets), well above the minimum levels. Under the capital regulations of the Federal Reserve, in order to be well-capitalized, a banking organization must maintain: A Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio to risk-weighted assets of 6.5 or more; A ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 8 or more; A ratio of Total Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 10 or more; and A leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total adjusted average quarterly assets of 5 or greater. 
 It is possible under the Basel III Rule to be well-capitalized while remaining out of compliance with the capital conservation buffer discussed above. As of December 31, 2022: (i) none of the Banks was subject to a directive from the Iowa Division of Banking, the Missouri Division of Finance, or the Federal Reserve, as applicable, to increase its capital and (ii) the Banks were well-capitalized, as defined by Federal Reserve regulations. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had regulatory capital in excess of the Federal Reserve s requirements and met the Basel III Rule requirements to be well-capitalized. The Company also is in compliance with the capital conservation buffer.

The concept of an institution being well-capitalized is part of a regulatory enforcement regime that provides the federal banking regulators with broad power to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of depository institutions based on the capital level of each particular institution. The extent of the regulators powers depends on whether the institution in question is adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized, in each case as defined by regulation. Depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned, the regulators corrective powers include: (i) requiring the institution to submit a capital restoration plan; (ii) limiting the institution s asset growth and restricting its activities; (iii) requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock (including additional voting stock) or to sell itself; (iv) restricting transactions between the institution and its affiliates; (v) restricting the interest rate that the institution may pay on deposits; (vi) ordering a new election of directors of the institution; (vii) requiring that senior executive officers or directors be dismissed; (viii) prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; (ix) requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries; (x) prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; and (xi) ultimately, appointing a receiver for the institution. Community Bank Capital Simplification . Community banks have long raised concerns with bank regulators about the regulatory burden, complexity, and costs associated with certain provisions of the Basel III Rule. In response, Congress provided an off-ramp for institutions, like the Company, with total consolidated assets of less than 10 billion. Section 201 of the Regulatory Relief Act instructed the federal banking regulators to establish a single Community Bank Leverage Ratio CBLR of between 8 and 10 . Under the final rule, a community banking organization is eligible to elect the new framework if it has: less than 10 billion in total consolidated assets, limited amounts of certain assets and off-balance sheet exposures, and a CBLR greater than 9 . The Company may elect the CBLR framework at any time but has not currently determined to do so. Supervision and Regulation of the Company General. The Company, as the sole stockholder of the Banks, is a bank holding company. As a bank holding company, the Company is registered with, and is subject to regulation, supervision and enforcement by, the Federal Reserve under the BHCA. The Company is legally obligated to act as a source of financial strength to the Banks and to commit resources to support the Banks in circumstances where the Company might not otherwise do so. Under the BHCA, the Company is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve. The Company is required to file with the Federal Reserve periodic reports of the Company s operations and such additional information regarding the Company and its subsidiaries as the Federal Reserve may require. Acquisitions, Activities and Financial Holding Company Election . The primary purpose of a bank holding company is to control and manage banks. The BHCA generally requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve for any merger involving a bank holding company or any acquisition by a bank holding company of another bank or bank holding company. Subject to certain conditions (including deposit concentration limits established by the BHCA), the Federal Reserve may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the United States. In approving interstate acquisitions, the Federal Reserve is required to give effect to applicable state law limitations on the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its FDIC-insured institution affiliates in the state in which the target bank is located (provided that those limits do not discriminate against out-of-state institutions or their holding companies) and state laws that require that the target bank have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) before being acquired by an out-of-state bank holding company. Furthermore, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies must be well-capitalized and well-managed in order to effect interstate mergers or acquisitions. For a discussion of the capital requirements, see The Role of Capital above.

 The BHCA generally prohibits the Company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to banks and their subsidiaries. This general prohibition is subject to a number of exceptions. The principal exception allows bank holding companies to engage in, and to own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the Federal Reserve prior to November 11, 1999 to be so closely related to banking ... as to be a proper incident thereto. This authority permits the Company to engage in a variety of banking-related businesses, including the ownership and operation of a savings association, or any entity engaged in consumer finance, equipment leasing, the operation of a computer service bureau (including software development) and mortgage banking and brokerage services. The BHCA does not place territorial restrictions on the domestic activities of nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies. Additionally, bank holding companies that meet certain eligibility requirements prescribed by the BHCA and elect to operate as financial holding companies may engage in, or own shares in companies engaged in, a wider range of nonbanking activities, including securities and insurance underwriting and sales, merchant banking and any other activity that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines by regulation or order is financial in nature or incidental to any such financial activity or that the Federal Reserve determines by order to be complementary to any such financial activity, as long as the activity does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of FDIC-insured institutions or the financial system generally. The Company has elected to operate as a financial holding company. In order to maintain its status as a financial holding company, the Company and the Banks must be well-capitalized, well-managed, and the Banks must have a least a satisfactory CRA rating. If the Federal Reserve determines that a financial holding company is not well-capitalized or well-managed, the Federal Reserve will provide a period of time in which to achieve compliance, but, during the period of noncompliance, the Federal Reserve may place any limitations on the Company that it deems appropriate. Furthermore, if the Federal Reserve determines that a financial holding company s subsidiary bank has not received a satisfactory CRA rating, that company will not be able to commence any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities. Change in Control. Federal law prohibits any person or company from acquiring control of an FDIC-insured depository institution or its holding company without prior notice to the appropriate federal bank regulator. Control is conclusively presumed to exist upon the acquisition of 25 or more of the outstanding voting securities of a bank or bank holding company, but may arise under certain circumstances between 10 and 24.99 ownership. Capital Requirements. Bank holding companies are required to maintain capital in accordance with Federal Reserve capital adequacy requirements. For a discussion of capital requirements, see The Role of Capital above. Dividend Payments. The Company s ability to pay dividends to its stockholders may be affected by both general corporate law considerations and policies of the Federal Reserve applicable to bank holding companies . As a Delaware corporation, the Company is subject to the limitations of the DGCL, which allow the Company to pay dividends only out of its surplus (as defined and computed in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL) or if the Company has no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends to stockholders if: (i) the company s net income available to stockholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention is 
 148 

Table of Contents 
 inconsistent with the company s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. The Federal Reserve also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations. Among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies. In addition, under the Basel III Rule, institutions that seek the freedom to pay dividends have to maintain 2.5 in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to the capital conservation buffer. See The Role of Capital above. Incentive Compensation. There have been a number of developments in recent years focused on incentive compensation plans sponsored by bank holding companies and banks, reflecting recognition by the bank regulatory agencies and Congress that flawed incentive compensation practices in the financial industry were one of many factors contributing to the global financial crisis. Layered on top of that are the abuses in the headlines dealing with product cross-selling incentive plans. The result is interagency guidance on sound incentive compensation practices. The interagency guidance recognized three core principles. Effective incentive plans should: (i) provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward; (ii) be compatible with effective controls and risk-management; and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization s board of directors. Much of the guidance addresses large banking organizations and, because of the size and complexity of their operations, the regulators expect those organizations to maintain systematic and formalized policies, procedures, and systems for ensuring that the incentive compensation arrangements for all executive and non-executive employees covered by this guidance are identified and reviewed, and appropriately balance risks and rewards. Smaller banking organizations, like the Company, that use incentive compensation arrangements are expected to be less extensive, formalized, and detailed than those of the larger banks. Monetary Policy. The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve has a significant effect on the operating results of financial or bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. Among the tools available to the Federal Reserve to affect the money supply are open market transactions in U.S. government securities and changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. Federal Securities Regulation. The Company s common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Exchange Act. Consequently, the Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading and other restrictions and requirements of the SEC under the Exchange Act. Corporate Governance . The Dodd-Frank Act addressed many investor protection, corporate governance and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. It increased stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a nonbinding vote on executive compensation and so-called golden parachute payments, and authorizing the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate and solicit voters for their own candidates using a company s proxy materials. The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of bank holding companies, regardless of whether such companies are publicly traded.

 Supervision and Regulation of the Banks General. The Company owns four subsidiary banks: QCBT, CRBT and CSB are chartered under Iowa law (collectively, the Iowa Banks and GB is chartered under Missouri law. The deposit accounts of the Banks are insured by the FDIC s DIF to the maximum extent provided under federal law and FDIC regulations, currently 250,000 per insured depositor category. All four of the Company s subsidiary banks are members of the Federal Reserve System member banks ). QCBT owns QCIA, a registered investment adviser, as a wholly-owned subsidiary. As Iowa-chartered, FDIC-insured banks, the Iowa Banks are subject to the examination, supervision, reporting and enforcement requirements of the Iowa Division of Banking, as the chartering authority for Iowa banks. As a Missouri-chartered, FDIC-insured bank, GB is subject to the examination, supervision, reporting and enforcement requirements of the Missouri Division of Finance, as the chartering authority for Missouri banks. All four of the Company s subsidiary banks also are subject to the examination, reporting and enforcement requirements of the Federal Reserve, as the primary federal regulator of member banks. In addition, the FDIC, as administrator of the DIF, has regulatory authority over the Banks. Deposit Insurance . As FDIC-insured institutions, the Banks are required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC. The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system whereby FDIC-insured institutions pay insurance premiums at rates based on their risk classification. For institutions like the Banks that are not considered large and highly complex banking organizations, assessments are now based on examination ratings and financial ratios. The total base assessment rates currently range from 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points. At least semi-annually, the FDIC updates its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, increases or decreases the assessment rates, following notice and comment on proposed rulemaking. The reserve ratio is the DIF balance divided by estimated insured deposits. In response to the global financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum reserve ratio from 1.15 to 1.35 of the estimated amount of total insured deposits. The reserve briefly exceed the statutory threshold, but because of extraordinary insured deposit growth caused by an unprecedented inflow of deposits during the pandemic, the reserve ratio fell below 1.35 and continues to be below the threshold. The FDIC staff closely monitors the factors that affect the reserve ratio, and, in order to raise the reserve ratios to 1.35 by September 30, 2028, the FDIC increased the initial deposit insurance rates by two basis points, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of the 2023 assessment. As a result of this change, the Bank s FDIC insurance assessment will increase beginning in 2023. The DIF balance was approximately 125.5 billion on September 30, 2022, up 1.0 billion from the end of the second quarter. The reserve ratio remained at 1.26 , as growth in the fund balance kept pace with growth in insured deposits. The FDIC staff continues to closely monitor the factors that affect the reserve ratio, and any change could impact FDIC assessments. Supervisory Assessments . Each of the Banks is required to pay supervisory assessments to its respective state banking regulator to fund the operations of that agency. The amount of the assessment payable by each Bank is calculated on the basis of that Bank s total assets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Iowa Banks paid supervisory assessments to the Iowa Division of Banking totaling 323,165 and GB paid supervisory assessments to the Missouri Division of Finance totaling 73,895. Capital Requirements. Banks are generally required to maintain capital levels in excess of other businesses. For a discussion of capital requirements, see The Role of Capital above.

Table of Contents 
 Liquidity Requirements. Liquidity is a measure of the ability and ease with which bank assets may be converted to cash. Liquid assets are those that can be converted to cash quickly if needed to meet financial obligations. To remain viable, FDIC-insured institutions must have enough liquid assets to meet their near-term obligations, such as withdrawals by depositors. Because the global financial crisis was in part a liquidity crisis, Basel III also includes a liquidity framework that requires FDIC-insured institutions to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests. One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio or LCR, is designed to ensure that the banking entity has an adequate stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets that can be converted easily and immediately in private markets into cash to meet liquidity needs for a 30-calendar day liquidity stress scenario. The other test, known as the net stable funding ratio or NSFR, is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of FDIC-insured institutions over a one-year horizon. These tests provide an incentive for banks and holding companies to increase their holdings in Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets, increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source and rely on stable funding like core deposits (in lieu of brokered deposits). In addition to liquidity guidelines already in place, the federal bank regulatory agencies implemented the Basel III LCR in September 2014, which requires large financial firms to hold levels of liquid assets sufficient to protect against constraints on their funding during times of financial turmoil, and in 2016 proposed implementation of the NSFR. While these rules do not, and will not, apply to the Banks, they continue to review their liquidity risk management policies in light of developments. Liability of Commonly Controlled Institutions. Under federal law, institutions insured by the FDIC may be liable for any loss incurred by, or reasonably expected to be incurred by, the FDIC in connection with the default of commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institutions or any assistance provided by the FDIC to commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institutions in danger of default. Because the Company controls each of the Banks, the Banks are commonly-controlled for purposes of these provisions of federal law. Dividend Payments. The primary source of funds for the Company is dividends from the Banks. In general, the Banks may only pay dividends either out of their historical net income after any required transfers to surplus or reserves have been made or out of their retained earnings. The Federal Reserve Act also imposes limitations on the amount of dividends paid by state member banks, such as the Banks. Without Federal Reserve approval, a state member bank may not pay dividends in any calendar year that, in the aggregate, exceed that bank s calendar year-to-date net income plus the bank s retained income for the two preceding calendar years. The payment of dividends by any FDIC-insured institution is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations, and an FDIC-insured institution generally is prohibited from paying any dividends if, following payment thereof, the institution would be undercapitalized. As described above, each of the Banks exceeded its minimum capital requirements under applicable guidelines as of December 31, 2022. Notwithstanding the availability of funds for dividends, however, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Missouri Division of Finance or the Iowa Division of Banking, as applicable, may prohibit the payment of dividends by one of the Banks if it determines such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. In addition, under the Basel III Rule, institutions that seek the freedom to pay unrestricted dividends have to maintain 2.5 in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to the capital conservation buffer. See The Role of Capital above. State Bank Investments and Activities. The Banks are permitted to make investments and engage in activities directly or through subsidiaries as authorized by Iowa or Missouri law, as applicable. However, under federal law and FDIC regulations, FDIC-insured state banks are prohibited, subject to certain 
 151 

Table of Contents 
 exceptions, from making or retaining equity investments of a type, or in an amount, that are not permissible for a national bank. Federal law and FDIC regulations also prohibit FDIC-insured state banks and their subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, from engaging as principal in any activity that is not permitted for a national bank unless the bank meets, and continues to meet, its minimum regulatory capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity would not pose a significant risk to the DIF. These restrictions have not had, and are not currently expected to have, a material impact on the operations of the Banks. Insider Transactions. The Banks are subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on covered transactions between each Bank and its affiliates. The Company is an affiliate of the Banks for purposes of these restrictions, and covered transactions subject to the restrictions include extensions of credit to the Company, investments in the stock or other securities of the Company and the acceptance of the stock or other securities of the Company as collateral for loans made by any of the Banks. The Dodd-Frank Act enhanced the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates, including an expansion of the definition of covered transactions and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained. Certain limitations and reporting requirements are also placed on extensions of credit by each Bank to its directors and officers, to directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries, to principal stockholders of the Company and to related interests of such directors, officers and principal stockholders. In addition, federal law and regulations may affect the terms on which any person who is a director or officer of the Company or the Banks, or a principal stockholder of the Company, may obtain credit from banks with which any of the Banks maintains a correspondent relationship. Safety and Soundness Standards/Risk Management. The federal banking agencies have adopted operational and managerial standards to promote the safety and soundness of FDIC-insured institutions. The standards apply to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, asset quality and earnings. In general, the safety and soundness standards prescribe the goals to be achieved in each area, and each institution is responsible for establishing its own procedures to achieve those goals. Although regulatory standards do not have the force of law, if an institution operates in an unsafe and unsound manner, the FDIC-insured institution s primary federal regulator may require the institution to submit a plan for achieving and maintaining compliance. If an FDIC-insured institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan, or fails in any material respect to implement a compliance plan that has been accepted by its primary federal regulator, the regulator is required to issue an order directing the institution to cure the deficiency. Until the deficiency cited in the regulator s order is cured, the regulator may restrict the FDIC-insured institution s rate of growth, require the FDIC-insured institution to increase its capital, restrict the rates that the institution pays on deposits, or require the institution to take any action that the regulator deems appropriate under the circumstances. Noncompliance with safety and soundness also may constitute grounds for other enforcement action by the federal bank regulatory agencies, including cease and desist orders and civil money penalty assessments. During the past decade, the bank regulatory agencies have increasingly emphasized the importance of sound risk management processes and strong internal controls when evaluating the activities of the FDIC-insured institutions that they supervise. Properly managing risks has been identified as critical to the conduct of safe and sound banking activities and has become even more important as new technologies, product innovation, and the size and speed of financial transactions have changed the nature of banking markets. The agencies have identified a spectrum of risks facing a banking institution including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal and reputational risk. Each Bank is expected to have active board and 
 152 

Table of Contents 
 senior management oversight; adequate policies, procedures and limits; adequate risk measurement, monitoring and management information systems; and comprehensive internal controls. Privacy and Cybersecurity. The Banks are subject to many U.S. federal and state laws and regulations governing requirements for maintaining policies and procedures to protect non-public confidential information of their customers. These laws require each Bank to periodically disclose its privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such information and permit consumers to opt out of their ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances. They also impact each Bank s ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. In addition, the Banks are required to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information. These security and privacy policies and procedures are in effect across all businesses and geographic locations. Branching Authority . The Iowa Banks have the authority under Iowa law to establish branches anywhere in the State of Iowa, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals. Similarly, GB has the authority under Missouri law to establish branches anywhere in the State of Missouri, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals. The Dodd-Frank Act permits well-capitalized and well-managed banks to establish new interstate branches or acquire individual branches of a bank in another state (rather than the acquisition of an out-of-state bank in its entirety) without impediments. In addition, federal law permits state and national banks to merge with banks in other states subject to: (i) regulatory approval; (ii) federal and state deposit concentration limits; and (iii) state law limitations requiring the merging bank to have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) prior to the merger. Transaction Account Reserves. Federal law requires FDIC-insured institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts) to provide liquidity. The amount of reserves is established by the Federal Reserve based on tranches of zero, three and ten percent of a bank s transaction account deposits. However, in March 2020, in an unprecedented move, the Federal Reserve announced that the banking system had ample reserves, and, as reserve requirements no longer played a significant role in this regime, it reduced all reserve tranches to zero percent, thereby freeing banks from the legally mandated reserve maintenance requirement. The action permits the Banks to loan or invest funds that were previously unavailable. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it expects to continue to operate in an ample reserves regime for the foreseeable future. Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Banks are each a member of the FHLB, which serves as a central credit facility for its members. The FHLB is funded primarily from proceeds from the sale of obligations of the FHLB system. It makes loans to member banks in the form of FHLB advances. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully collateralized as determined by the FHLB. Community Reinvestment Act Requirements. The CRA requires the Banks to have a continuing and affirmative obligation in a safe and sound manner to help meet the credit needs of the entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Federal regulators regularly assess each Bank s record of meeting the credit needs of its communities. Applications for additional acquisitions would be affected by the evaluation of the Bank s effectiveness in meeting its CRA requirements. In May 2022, the bank regulatory agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking called the Joint Proposal to Strengthen and Modernize Community Reinvestment Act Regulations (the CRA Proposal ). The CRA Proposal is designed to update how CRA activities qualify for consideration, where CRA activities are considered, and how CRA activities are evaluated. More specifically, the bank regulatory agencies described the goals of the CRA Proposal as follows: (i) to expand access to credit, investment and basic banking services in low and moderated income communities; (ii) to adapt to changes in the banking industry, including mobile and 
 153 

Table of Contents 
 internet banking by modernizing assessment areas while maintaining a focus on branch based areas; (iii) to provide greater clarity, consistency, and transparency in the application of the regulations through the use of standardized metrics as part of CRA evaluation and clarifying eligible CRA activities focused on low-and moderate-income communities and under-served rural communities; (iv) to tailor CRA rules and data collection to bank size and business model; and (v) to maintain a unified approach among the regulators. A final rule has not yet been issued. Anti-Money Laundering. The USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act and other similar laws are designed to deny terrorists and criminals the ability to obtain access to the U.S. financial system and have significant implications for FDIC-insured institutions and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. These laws mandate financial services companies to have policies and procedures with respect to measures designed to address the following matters: (i) customer identification programs; (ii) money laundering; (iii) terrorist financing; (iv) identifying and reporting suspicious activities and currency transactions; (v) currency crimes; and (vi) cooperation between FDIC-insured institutions and law enforcement authorities. Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate. Concentration risk exists when FDIC-insured institutions deploy too many assets to any one industry or segment. A concentration in CRE is one example of regulatory concern. The interagency Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices guidance CRE Guidance provides supervisory criteria, including the following numerical indicators, to assist bank examiners in identifying banks with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny: (i) CRE loans exceeding 300 of capital and increasing 50 or more in the preceding three years; or (ii) construction and land development loans exceeding 100 of capital. The CRE Guidance does not limit banks levels of CRE lending activities, but rather guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentrations. On December 18, 2015, the federal banking agencies issued a statement to reinforce prudent risk-management practices related to CRE lending, having observed substantial growth in many CRE asset and lending markets, increased competitive pressures, rising CRE concentrations in banks, and an easing of CRE underwriting standards. The federal bank agencies reminded FDIC-insured institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise prudent risk-management practices to identify, measure, monitor, and manage the risks arising from CRE lending. In addition, FDIC-insured institutions must maintain capital commensurate with the level and nature of their CRE concentration risk. As of December 31, 2022, QCBT, CRBT and GB were in compliance with the 300 guideline for commercial real estate loans. Although CSB s loan portfolio has historically been real estate dominated and its real estate portfolio levels exceed these policy limits, it has established a Credit Risk Committee to routinely monitor its real estate portfolio. Consumer Financial Services. The historical structure of federal consumer protection regulation applicable to all providers of consumer financial products and services changed significantly on July 21, 2011, when the CFPB commenced operations to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all providers of consumer products and services, including the Banks, as well as the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over providers with more than 10 billion in assets. FDIC-insured institutions with 10 billion or less in assets, like the Banks, continue to be examined by their applicable bank regulators. Because abuses in connection with residential mortgages were a significant factor contributing to the global financial crisis, many rules issued by the CFPB, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, addressed mortgage and mortgage-related products, their underwriting, origination, servicing and sales. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded underwriting requirements applicable to loans secured by 1-4 family residential real property and augmented federal law combating predatory lending practices. In addition to 
 154 

Table of Contents 
 numerous disclosure requirements, the Dodd-Frank Act and the CFPB s enabling rules imposed new standards for mortgage loan originations on all lenders, including banks and savings associations, in an effort to strongly encourage lenders to verify a borrower s ability to repay, while also establishing a presumption of compliance for certain qualified mortgages. The CFPB s rules have not had a significant impact on any Bank operations, except for higher compliance costs. Regulation of QCIA QCIA provides financial investment services as part of the wealth management operations of the Company. QCIA is an investment adviser registered with the SEC. The SEC has supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over its operations. The SEC s focus is primarily for the protection of investors under the federal securities laws.
