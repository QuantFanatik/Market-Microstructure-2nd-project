ITEM
1: BUSINESS 

Our
History 

Our
company was incorporated in the State of Delaware in September 2006 and was formerly known as Greenmark Acquisition Corporation Greenmark ).
On February 7, 2011, Greenmark Acquisition Corporation and Powerdyne, Inc., a Nevada corporation Powerdyne Nevada ), merged
with Greenmark as the surviving company. Powerdyne Nevada was formed in February 2010 in the State of Nevada and had limited operations
until the time of its combination with Greenmark. As part of the merger, Greenmark Acquisition Corporation, the surviving entity, changed
its name to Powerdyne International, Inc. prior to the merger, Greenmark did not have any ongoing business or operations and was established
for the purpose of completing mergers and acquisitions with a target company, such as Powerdyne Nevada. 

During
the quarter ended March 31, 2019, Powerdyne International, Inc. purchased several crypto currency miners and began mining certain crypto
coins. This was completed to enter the crypto markets and explore other potential revenue opportunities for Powerdyne International,
Inc. 

On
March 6, 2022, pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement (the SPA ), Powerdyne International, Inc. (the Company ),
acquired 100 of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Creative Motion Technology, LLC, a Massachusetts limited liability
company, (the Membership Interests ). The Membership Interests was owned by Mr. James F. O Rourke, the principal owner
and sole director and officer of the Company. The purchase price paid by the Company was 2,000,000 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock
valued at 1,500,000, which each Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into 1,000 common shares of the Company at a fixed price of
 0.0001 at the option of the holder. 

Overview 

Creative
Motion Technology, LLC CM Tech is a small New England based motor manufacturer founded in 2004 and has been in business
for over 19 years. CM Tech s management has over 60 years of design and manufacturing expertise, specializing in the design and
custom building of industrial servomotors both brush and brushless motor designs. CM Tech s current market focus is on the niche
motor demands for low volume, high-quality cost-effective motors which are primarily used in industrial robotics for the semiconductor
manufacturing industry. The motors that CM Tech currently has in production primarily provide the X, Y, and Z axis articulation in
factory automation robots. 

Included
with CM Tech acquisition is Frame One, which is a custom picture framing shop located in North Reading, MA. Frame One has been in business
since 2006 and brings with it a strong client base consisting of local schools, colleges, artist guilds, artists, interior decorators/designers,
museums, photographers, art galleries and theaters. 

Business
Segments 

We
primarily service the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM s) in the semiconductor market by supplying custom designed motors
for the robotics used in semiconductor manufacturing equipment. We provide cost-effective value-added turn-key solutions to our
clients drives and articulation needs. 

1 

The
Market 

We
service the Global Semiconductor Equipment Manufacture s our Sales to International customers were 36 and 54 of our total sales
in 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Suppliers

We
have developed a strong collaborative relationship with a select few ISO Certified component manufacturers both domestically and in
Asia. These strategic relationships have been developed over the past 20 years, which ensure that we are able to maintain a steady flow
of components while maintaining a high level of quality. With these relationships we are able to run a production base on a just-in-time
inventory (JIT) allowing us to keep a minimum amount of inventory. 

Foreign
Trade Regulations 

A
large portion of the products we distribute are manufactured in Asia, including China. The purchase of goods manufactured in foreign
countries is subject to several risks, including economic disruptions, including recent disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,
transportation delays and interruptions, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, imposition of tariffs and import and export controls, and
changes in governmental policies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

From
time to time, protectionist pressures have influenced U.S. trade policy concerning the imposition of significant duties or other
trade restrictions upon foreign products. We cannot predict whether additional U.S. customs quotas, duties, taxes or other charges
or restrictions will be imposed upon the importation of foreign components in the future or what effect any of these actions would
have on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. During 2022, we remained impacted by tariff costs on certain
products imported from China, which went into effect as of July 6, 2018. However, we also have been able to share the increases with
our customers to help mitigate these costs. 

Our
ability to remain competitive with respect to the pricing of imported components could be adversely affected by increases in tariffs
or duties, changes in trade treaties, strikes in air or sea transportation, and possible future U.S. legislation with respect to pricing
and import quotas on products from foreign countries. For example, it is possible that political or economic developments in China, or
with respect to the United States relationship with China, could have an adverse effect on our business. Our ability to remain
competitive also could be affected by other governmental actions related to, among other things, anti-dumping legislation and international
currency fluctuations. While we do not believe that any of these factors adversely impact our business at present, we cannot be assured that
these factors will not materially adversely affect us in the future. Any significant disruption in the delivery of merchandise from our
suppliers, substantially all of whom are foreign, could have a material adverse impact on our business and the results of operations. 

Employees 

We
have one executive officer. We have 7 full-time employees, and 5 consultants including legal, accounting, and information technology.

foreseeable future. Whether we declare and pay dividends is determined by our Board of Directors at their discretion, subject to certain
limitations imposed under Delaware corporate law. The timing, amount, and form of dividends, if any, will depend on, among other things,
our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. We are
not aware of any contractual or similar restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends, currently or in the future. See Management s
Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations; Liquidity and Capital Resources.

ITEM
7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION 

This
discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to differ
materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements as a result of many important factors, including those
set forth in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption Risk Factors. Please see Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in Part I above. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking
statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Annual Report. The following discussion should be
read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, appearing in Item 8 of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Use
of Estimates We have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form
10-K in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. These estimates have a significant impact on our
valuation and reserve accounts relating to the allowance for sales returns and allowances, doubtful accounts, inventory reserves and
deferred income taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

Overview 

We
are an operating company which has experienced losses since our inception. Our sources of cash to date have been capital invested by
shareholders, officers, and venture capital investors/lenders. 

During
the 1st quarter of 2019, Powerdyne International, Inc. purchased several crypto currency miners and began mining certain crypto coins.
This was to conservatively enter the crypto markets and explore other potential revenue producing opportunities for Powerdyne International,
Inc. 

The
coins are stored in our Sia coin digital wallet which is housed in Sia coins cloud storage. 

Powerdyne
has a bill of sale that shows ownership via serial #s and, has possession of the miners and the Sia coin digital wallet codes. The biggest
cyber security threat is an exchange being hacked in which the exchanges have insurance for the client s funds and coins. For security,
Powerdyne stores all its Sia coins in our digital wallet and are only transferred to the exchange when they are to be converted to USD.
Powerdyne has its digital wallet address and pass codes stored offline, and backups are also stored offline in separate locations. Powerdyne
believes the cyber threat is very low do to the very small size and value of our mining operation and the complexity required to break
into a crypto wallet. 

4 

Governmental
Regulations Regarding Crypto Currency 

Government
regulation of block chain and crypto is being actively considered by the United States federal government via a number of agencies (including
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), the U.S. Commodities Future Trading Commission CFTC ),
Federal Trade Commission FTC ), and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network FinCEN of the U.S. Department
of the Treasury) and in other countries. Other regulatory bodies are governmental or semi-governmental and have shown an interest in
regulating or investigating companies engaged in the block chain business (NASDAQ, NYSE, FINRA, state securities commissions). 

Block
chain and crypto currency regulations are in a nascent state with agencies investigating businesses and their practices, gathering information,
and generally trying to understand the risks and uncertainties in order to protect investors in these businesses. Regulations will certainly
increase, in many cases, although it is presently not possible to know how they will increase, how regulations will apply to the Company s
businesses, or when they will be effective. Various bills have also been proposed in congress for adoption related to the Company s
business which may be adopted and have an impact on it. As the regulatory and legal environment evolves, the Company may become subject
to new laws and further regulation by the SEC and other agencies, although the Company is not currently trading in digital assets and
has no intention to trade in digital assets. 

Investment
Company Act 1940 

Although
we will be subject to regulation under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the 1934 Act, we believe we will not be subject to
regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act insofar as we will not be engaged in the business of
investing or trading in securities. We have no intent to continue to engage in the business of buying and selling digital assets. In
the event we engage in such business that results in us holding passive investment interests in digital assets, we could be subject to
regulation under the 1940 Act. In such an event, we would be required to register as an investment company and incur significant registration
and compliance costs. We have obtained no formal determination from the SEC as to our status under the 1940 Act and, consequently, any
violation of the 1940 Act would subject us to material adverse consequences. We believe that, currently, we are exempt under Regulation
3a-2 of the 1940 Act. 

The
value of the Cryptocurrency held by the Company is determined by the price of the Cryptocurrency as set forth by Bittrex, Inc., a U.S.
cryptocurrency platform, as of the last day of each of the Company s financial quarters. In the event that the value of the Company s
Cryptocurrency holdings exceeds forty percent (40 of the Company s total assets, the Company intends to sell that amount of its
Cryptocurrencies that will allow the Company to remain exempt under Regulation 3a-2 of the 1940 Act. 

As
of the year ended December 31, 2022, Powerdyne has stopped the mining of Sia coin and any crypto currency due to the lack of productivity
of its crypto miners. 

New
Operating Business: 

On
March 6, 2022, pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement (the SPA ), Powerdyne International, Inc. (the Company ),
acquired 100 of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Creative Motion Technology, LLC, a Massachusetts limited liability
company, (the Membership Interest ). The Membership Interest was owned by Mr. James F. O Rourke, the principal owner
and sole director and officer of the Company. The purchase price paid by the Company was 2,000,000 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock
valued at 1,500,000, which each Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into 1,000 common shares of the Company at a fixed price of
 0.0001 at the option of the holder. 

Results
of Operations 

The
Year Ended December 31, 2022, compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021. 

We
generated product revenue of 1,207,168 during the year ended December 31, 2022, and digital revenues of 48,602 during the year ended
December 31, 2021. The increase in product revenue is due to the merger of CM Tech and Frame One CM Tech ). CM Tech is
a motor manufacturer which are primarily used in the industrial robotics for the semiconductor manufacturing industry. All of CM Tech s
product revenue is generated from the sale of their motors. Frame One provides custom framing to local schools, colleges, artist guilds,
artists, interior decorators, interior decorators / designers, museums, photographers, art galleries and theaters. 

The
increase in cost of products sold increased due to the acquisition of CM Tech from 3,000 in December 31, 2021 to 801,040. Cost of
products sold consists of materials of approximately 550,000; payroll and payroll taxes of approximately 210,000 and the balance
to shipping and freight of approximately 13,000 and other miscellaneous cost allocations. We expect that as
revenues for CM Tech increase, the cost of products sold will increase on a linear basis. Gross profit for the year ended December 31,
2022, is 406,128 with a gross profit percentage of 33.64 and is expected be maintained in a range of 33 to 35 for product
revenue sold. 

5 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, total operating expenses increased 409 to 356,374 from 87,136 for the year ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in operating expenses is due to the acquisition of CMT Tech. In 2022, operating expenses consisted of employee salaries of
approximately 50,000, salary for CEO of 60,000, employee bonus of 12,500; contract labor of 24,000, health insurance of 23,000,
rent expense of 44,000, legal and accounting for 64,000 and consultants for 30,000. The balance of 49,000 remaining operating expenses
are made up of various miscellaneous charges such as workers compensation, office supplies, computer expenses, etc. 

Income
tax provision was 0 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

As
a result of the foregoing, we recognized a net loss of 1,342,016 and 43,156 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The loss on a related party
transaction is considered a non routine, non-cash, one time transaction, when we reverse this transaction from our net loss.
The Company would have a profit of 49,754, which represents 4.12 of net product revenue. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of December 31, 2022, and 2021, we had working capital deficits of 4,987 and 176,257, respectively. We historically have satisfied
our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations, subordinated related party promissory notes and issuance of equity
securities. However, with the acquisition of CMT our working capital position has materially improved but our cash flow from operations
is still negative, which requires that we need additional financing to fund operations. The majority of our financing of operations comes
from our CEO and majority owner. We expect that as our revenues increase that our cash flow from operations and working capital positions
will continue to improve. A summary of our cash flows resulting from our operating, investing, and financing activities for the years
ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 were as follows:

 Investing activities

 Financing activities

 (46,920 

Cash
used by operating activities increased to 44,273 during 2022, as compared to 38,631 in the prior year. The 5,642 increase was primarily
due to funding working capital due to the increase in revenues from the CMT acquisition. 

Cash
provided by financing activities was 69,179 during 2022, as compared to 46.920 in the prior year. In 2022, our CEO funded the required
working capital deficit for our operations. 

We
believe that funds generated from operations, existing cash balances and, if necessary, related party short-term loans, are likely to
be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future. We have and continue to
receive financing in the form of loans from our CEO to provide our required working capital. Our ability to meet our obligations and
continue to operate as a going concern is highly dependent on our ability to obtain additional financing. We cannot predict whether this
additional financing will be in the form of equity or debt. The financing for these goals could come from further equity financing or
could come from sales of securities and /or loans. If we are not successful in generating sufficient liquidity from operations or in
raising sufficient capital resources, on terms acceptable to us, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations liquidity and financial condition.

On February 27,

Inflation 

In
the opinion of management, inflation has not and will not have a material effect on our operations in the immediate future. However,
any substantial supply side price increases will be shared with our customers. 

Management
will continue to monitor inflation and evaluate the possible future effects of inflation on our business and operations.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To
the shareholders and the board of director of Powerdyne International, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Powerdyne International, Inc. as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity / (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related
notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States. 

Substantial
Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated
deficit. In addition, the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described
in Note 3. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
audit matters 

The
critical audit matters communicated below is a matter from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were
communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosure
that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication
of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are
not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or
disclosures to which they relate.

to M in revenues annually. As of
December 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of . The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent
on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and/or obtaining additional financing from its
members or other sources, as may be required. For the year ended December 31, 2022, CM Tech has negative cash flow from operations, however,
the Company s management expects that this will change in the near future. 

The
Company s activities will necessitate significant uses of working capital beyond December 31, 2022. Additionally, the Company s
capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the success of the Company s sales, cash flow from operations and the
status of competitive products. The Company plans to continue financing its operations with cash received from financing activities,
revenue from operations and or affiliate funding. 

While
the Company strongly believes that its capital resources will be sufficient in the near term, there is no assurance that the Company s
activities will generate sufficient revenues to sustain its operations without additional capital or, if additional capital is needed,
that such funds if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. 

The
accompanying audited consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern;
however, the above condition raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to do so. The consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts
and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

ITEM
9 A: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act as of the end
of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were effective such that the information required
to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive
and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting. 

a)
Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for the Company.
Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent nor detect misstatements.
Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 

Our
internal controls framework is based on the criteria set forth in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) Pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
(ii) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of our management and directors; and (iii) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Based
on such criteria, our management, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that it was effective as of December 31, 2022. 

As
a smaller reporting company, management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting is not subject to attestation
by our independent registered public accounting firm and as such, no attestation was performed by our independent registered public accounting
firm. 

b)
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that
occurred in our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

President,
 Secretary, CFO and Director 
 
 May

James
F. O Rourke serves as Chief Executive Officer and Director of the Company. He attended Lowell Technological Institute. With
over thirty-five years experience in manufacturing from design conception to production as well as in acquisitions, mergers and
managing the operational side of startup businesses, Mr. O Rourke (the Vice Present and General Manager of SatCon Technology Corporation,
the Manager of Drive Systems for its Applied Technology business unit and the Manager of its Magmotor business unit) was responsible
for SatCon s day-to-day operation and subsequently was instrumental in the formation of SatCon s successor: SatCon Power
Systems. Mr. O Rourke then founded CM Technology (which designs and manufactures custom motors for the automotive, industrial,
and robotic markets as well as high power rotary uninterruptable power supplies (RUPS) for the distributed generation, industrial, telecommunication,
cloud data center and power quality markets). Mr. O Rourke, who is still actively involved in CM, joined Powerdyne as a consultant
in 2013 and was elected its CEO and a Director in 2014. Due to Mr. O Rourke s knowledge of our industry and his manufacturing
experience we selected him to serve as a director. 

Audit
Committee 

Powerdyne
does not presently have an Audit Committee and the Board of Director (the Board acts in such capacity for the immediate
future due to the limited size of the Board. Powerdyne intends to increase the size of its Board in the future, at which time it may
appoint an Audit Committee. 

In
lieu of an Audit Committee the Board is empowered to make such examinations as are necessary to monitor the corporate financial reporting
and the external audits of Powerdyne, to provide to the Board of Director the results of its examinations and recommendations derived
there from, to outline to the Board improvements made, or to be made, in internal control, to nominate independent auditors, and to provide
to the Board such additional information and materials as it may deem necessary to make the Board aware of significant financial matters
that require Board attention. 

8 

Compensation
Committee 

Powerdyne
does not presently have a Nominating Committee and the Board acts in such capacity for the immediate future due to the limited size of
the Board. Powerdyne intends to increase the size of its Board in the future, at which time it may appoint a Compensation Committee. 

The
Compensation Committee will be authorized to review and make recommendations to the Board regarding all forms of compensation to be provided
to the executive officers and directors of Powerdyne, including stock compensation, and bonus compensation to all employees. 

Nominating
Committee 

Powerdyne
does not have a Nominating Committee and the Board acts in such a capacity. 

Code
of Conduct and Ethics 

To
date, we have not adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to our principal executive officer and principal financial officer because the
Company has no meaningful operations. The Company does not believe that a formal written code of ethics is necessary at this time. We
expect that the Company will adopt a code of ethics if and when the Company successfully completes a business combination that results
in the acquisition of an on-going business and thereby commences operations. 

Indemnification
of Executive Officers and Directors 

Our
articles provide to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law, wherein our directors or officers shall not be personally liable to
the Company or our stockholders for damages for breach of such directors or officers fiduciary duty. The effect of this provision of
our articles is to eliminate our rights and the rights of our stockholders (through stockholders derivative suits on behalf of
the Company) to recover damages against a director or officer for breach of the fiduciary duty of care as a director or officer (including
breaches resulting from negligent or grossly negligent behavior), except under certain situations defined by statute. We believe that
the indemnification provisions in our articles are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and officers. 

Delaware
corporate law provides that a corporation may indemnify a director, officer, employee or agent made a party to an action by reason of
that fact that he was a director, officer employee or agent of the corporation or was serving at the request of the corporation against
expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably
believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation and with respect to any criminal action, had no reasonable
cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. 

CONFLICTS
OF INTEREST - GENERAL 

Our
sole director and officer is, or may become, in his individual capacities, an officer, director, controlling shareholder and/or partner
of other entities engaged in a variety of businesses. Thus, there exist potential conflicts of interest including, among other things,
time, efforts, and corporation opportunity, involved in participation with such other business entities. While our sole officer and director
of our business is engaged in business activities outside of our business, he devotes to our business such time as he believes to be
necessary. 

CONFLICTS
OF INTEREST - CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES 

Presently
no requirement is contained in our Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, or minutes which requires officers and directors of our business to
disclose to us business opportunities which come to their attention. Our officers and directors do, however, have a fiduciary duty of
loyalty to us to disclose to us any business opportunities which come to their attention, in their capacity as an officer and/or director
or otherwise. Excluded from this duty would be opportunities which the person learns about through his involvement as an officer and
director of another company. We have no intention of merging with or acquiring an affiliate, associate person or business opportunity
from any affiliate or any client of any such person.
