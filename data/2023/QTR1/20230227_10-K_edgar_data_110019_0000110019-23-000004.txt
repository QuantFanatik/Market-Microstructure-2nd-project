 PART I 

Item 1. Business 
 In this report, Northwest Pipeline LLC (Northwest) is at times referred to in the first person as we, us, or our. 
 Northwest is indirectly owned by The Williams Companies, Inc. (Williams), a publicly traded Delaware corporation. 
 
 GENERAL 
 We own and operate a natural gas pipeline system that extends from the San Juan Basin in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado through the states of Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon and Washington to a point on the Canadian border near Sumas, Washington. We provide natural gas transportation services for markets in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, California and Arizona, either directly or indirectly through interconnections with other pipelines. Our principal business is the interstate transportation of natural gas, which is regulated by FERC. 
 Our system includes approximately 3,900 miles of mainline and lateral transmission pipeline and 42 transmission compressor stations. Our compression facilities have a combined sea level-rated capacity of approximately 476,000 horsepower. At December 31, 2022, our natural gas pipeline had a design capacity of approximately 3.8 MMdth/d. 
 We own a one-third undivided interest in the Jackson Prairie underground storage facility located near Chehalis, Washington. We have a contract for natural gas storage services in an underground storage reservoir in the Clay Basin Field located in Daggett County, Utah. The owner of this storage field was acquired by Williams in February 2023. We also own and operate a LNG storage facility near Plymouth, Washington. We have approximately 13.5 Bcf of working natural gas storage capacity through these three storage facilities, which is substantially utilized for third-party natural gas. These natural gas storage facilities enable us to balance daily receipts and deliveries and provide storage services to our customers. 
 We transport and store natural gas for a broad mix of customers, including public utilities, municipalities, direct industrial users, electric power generators, and natural gas marketers and producers. We offer firm and interruptible transportation and storage service. Our firm transportation and storage contracts are generally long-term contracts with various expiration dates and account for the major portion of our business. During 2022, our three largest customers were Puget Sound Energy, Inc., Northwest Natural Gas Company, and Cascade Natural Gas Corporation, which accounted for approximately 29 percent, 11 percent, and 11 percent, respectively, of our total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. No other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our total operating revenues during that period. 
 Our rates are subject to the rate-making policies of the FERC. We provide a significant portion of our transportation and storage services pursuant to long-term firm contracts that obligate our customers to pay us monthly capacity reservation fees, which are fees that are owed for reserving an agreed upon amount of pipeline or storage capacity regardless of the amount of pipeline or storage capacity actually utilized by a customer. When a customer utilizes the capacity it has reserved under a firm transportation contract, we also collect a volumetric fee based on the quantity of natural gas transported. These volumetric fees are typically a small percentage of the total fees received under a firm contract. We also derive a small portion of our revenues from short-term firm and interruptible contracts under which customers pay fees for transportation, storage and other related services. The high percentage of our revenue derived from capacity reservation fees helps mitigate the risk of revenue fluctuations caused by changing supply and demand conditions. 
 
 RATE MATTERS 
 FERC regulation requires all terms and conditions of service, including the rates charged, to be filed with and accepted by the FERC before any changes can go into effect. We establish our rates primarily through the FERC s ratemaking process, but we also may negotiate rates with our customers pursuant to the terms of our tariff and FERC policy. Key determinants in the ratemaking process are (1) costs of providing service, including depreciation expense, (2) allowed rate of return, including the equity component of the capital structure and related income taxes, and (3) contract and volume throughput assumptions. The allowed rate of return is determined in each rate case. Rate design and the allocation of costs between the reservation and commodity rates also impact profitability. As a result of these proceedings, certain revenues may be collected subject to refund. We record estimates of rate refund liabilities considering our and third-party regulatory proceedings, advice of counsel, and other risks.

 Rate Case Settlement 
 On November 15, 2022, the FERC approved our Petition for Approval of Pre-Filing Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (Settlement) in Docket No. RP22-1155. The Settlement establishes a new general system firm Rate Schedule TF-1 (Large Customer) daily reservation rate of 0.37250/Dth with a 0.00935/Dth commodity rate, effective January 1, 2023, resolves other rate issues, establishes a Modernization and Emission Reduction Program and satisfies our rate case filing obligation under our settlement in Docket No. RP17-346. The Settlement establishes a moratorium on any NGA Section 4 or 5 proceedings that would seek to place new rates in effect any earlier than January 1, 2026. The Settlement also provides that we will file an NGA Section 4 general rate case with rates to be effective not later than April 1, 2028, unless (a) we have entered into a pre-filing settlement or (b) a Section 5 general rate case has been filed on or before April 1, 2028. 
 
 REGULATION 
 FERC Regulation 
 Our interstate transmission and storage activities are subject to regulation by the FERC under the NGA, and under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, as amended, and, as such, our rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, the extension, enlargement, or abandonment of jurisdictional facilities, and accounting, among other things, are subject to regulation. We hold certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the FERC authorizing ownership and operation of pipelines, facilities, and properties for which certificates are required under the NGA. FERC Standards of Conduct govern the relationship between natural gas transmission providers and marketing function employees as defined by the rule. The standards of conduct are intended to prevent natural gas transmission providers from preferentially benefiting gas marketing functions by requiring the employees of a transmission provider that perform transmission functions to function independently from gas marketing employees and by restricting the information that transmission providers may provide to gas marketing employees. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FERC is authorized to impose civil penalties of up to approximately 1.5 million per day for each violation of its rules. 
 Updated Certificate Policy Statement and Interim Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Policy Statement On February 18, 2022, the FERC issued two policy statements providing guidance for its pending and future consideration of interstate natural gas pipeline projects. The first policy statement is an Updated Certificate Policy Statement, which provides an analytical framework for how the FERC will consider whether a project is in the public convenience and necessity and explains that the FERC will consider all impacts of a proposed project, including economic and environmental impacts, together. The second policy statement is an Interim GHG Policy Statement, which sets forth how the FERC will assess the impacts of natural gas infrastructure projects on climate change in its reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act and the NGA. The FERC sought comment on all aspects of the policy statements, including the approach to assessing the significance of the proposed project s contribution to climate change. On March 24, 2022, the FERC issued an order converting the Updated Certificate Policy Statement and the Interim GHG Policy Statement into draft policy statements and announcing that it will not apply either policy statement to pending applications or applications filed before the FERC issues any final guidance on the policy statements. The FERC has not yet issued final guidance on the policy statements. 
 Environmental Matters 
 Our operations are subject to federal environmental laws and regulations as well as the state and local laws and regulations adopted by the jurisdictions in which we operate. We could incur liability to governments or third parties for any unlawful discharge of pollutants into the air, soil, or water, as well as liability for cleanup costs. Materials could be released into the environment in several ways including, but not limited to: 
 Leakage from underground gas storage caverns, pipelines, transportation facilities, and storage tanks; 
 Damage to facilities resulting from accidents during normal operations; 
 Damages to equipment and facilities resulting from storm events or natural disasters; and 
 Blowouts, cratering, and explosions. 
 In addition, we may be liable for environmental damage caused by former owners or operators of our properties. 
 We believe compliance with current environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or current competitive position. However, environmental laws and regulations could affect our business in various ways from time to time, including incurring capital and maintenance expenditures, fines and penalties, and

 creating the need to seek relief from the FERC for rate increases to recover the costs of certain capital expenditures and operation and maintenance expenses. 
 Washington State Climate Commitment Act In 2021, the state of Washington passed its Climate Commitment Act establishing a market-based cap-and-invest program to reduce carbon emissions. This program takes effect on January 1, 2023, and sets a limit, or cap, on overall carbon emissions in the state and requires businesses like ours to obtain allowances equal to their annual covered carbon emissions. The state s cap will be reduced over time to meet the state s carbon emissions reduction targets, which means fewer carbon emissions allowances will be available to purchase each year. These allowances can be purchased through quarterly auctions hosted by the state or bought and sold on a secondary market. Beginning in 2023, we will be required to obtain allowances for the carbon emissions from nine of our thirteen compressor stations within the state whose annual carbon emissions exceed 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. We will also be required to obtain allowances for our delivery of natural gas to some of our customers and some of our facilities in the state whose annual carbon emissions are insufficient to require their direct participation in the program. Our Settlement in Docket No. RP22-1155 allows us to recover the costs of obtaining allowances under the program in our next rate case. 
 For additional information regarding the potential impact of federal, state, or local regulatory measures on our business and specific environmental issues, please refer to Risk Factors Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, which may expose us to significant costs, liabilities, and expenditures that could exceed our expectations, and Environmental Matters in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 Contingent Liabilities and Commitments of Notes to Financial Statements. 
 Safety and Maintenance 
 Our operations are subject to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Jobs Creation Act of 2011 (Pipeline Safety Act), and the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (PIPES Act) of 2016 and 2020, which regulate safety requirements in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of interstate natural gas transmission facilities. The United States Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) administers federal pipeline safety laws. 
 Federal pipeline safety laws authorize PHMSA to establish minimum safety standards for pipeline facilities and persons engaged in the transportation of gas or hazardous liquids by pipeline. These safety standards apply to the design, construction, testing, operation, and maintenance of gas and hazardous liquids pipeline facilities affecting interstate or foreign commerce. PHMSA has also established reporting requirements for operators of gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities, as well as provisions for establishing the qualification of pipeline personnel and requirements for managing the integrity of gas transmission and distribution lines and certain hazardous liquid pipelines. To ensure compliance with these provisions, PHMSA performs pipeline safety inspections and has the authority to initiate enforcement actions. 
 In October 2019, PHMSA published the first of three rules that would be a part of the Mega Rule. The Mega Rule was more than 10 years in the making and since October 2019, PHMSA has also published Rules 2 and 3 as a part of the Mega Rule implementation. In August 2022, PHMSA published Rule 2, which is the last in the three part Mega Rule set of regulations. Certain portions of Rule 2 go into effect in May 2023 with the remaining portions taking effect in February 2024. Rule 2 contains new corrosion control requirements, new requirements for repair criteria outside of high consequence areas (HCAs), inspections to be performed after extreme weather events or natural disasters, management of change, and other integrity management related rule changes. We are evaluating procedures that will need to be updated to maintain compliance and are also analyzing anticipated cost impacts. 
 PHMSA s new rule, Requirement of Valve Installation and Minimum Rupture Detection Standards, went into effect in October 2022. The rupture monitoring and emergency response standards are applicable to existing pipelines, but the installation of rupture mitigation valves (RMVs) is not retroactive and only applies to new pipelines and significant pipeline replacements. This new rule establishes criteria for how operators must monitor and respond to potential ruptures on their system. It also outlines requirements for the installation of RMVs or Alternative Equivalent Technology to allow for quicker isolation after an incident has occurred. In response to the new regulation, we have updated all applicable procedures and are developing implementation plans as a result of the rulemaking. 
 Pipeline Integrity Regulations We have an enterprise-wide Gas Integrity Management Plan that meets the PHMSA final rule that was issued pursuant to the requirements of the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002. The rules require pipeline operators to develop an integrity management program for transmission pipelines that could affect HCAs in the event of pipeline failure. The integrity management program includes a baseline assessment plan along with periodic reassessments to be completed within required time frames. In meeting the integrity regulations, we have identified HCAs and developed baseline assessment plans. Ongoing periodic reassessments and initial assessments of any new HCAs have been completed. Also, in 
 5 

Table of Contents 

 response to the portion of the Mega Rule implemented in 2021, we have identified Moderate Consequence Areas and Class 3 and 4 pipeline locations required by the rule and integrated those segments into our integrity program, and have begun scheduling required assessments and reassessments as needed to meet the regulatory timelines. We estimate that the cost to be incurred in 2023 associated with this program to be approximately 28 million. Management considers the costs associated with compliance with the rule to be prudent costs incurred in the ordinary course of business and, therefore, recoverable through our rates. 
 Cybersecurity Matters 
 The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) issued Security Directive Pipeline-2021-01B (Security Directive 1B) on May 29, 2022, which requires that owners/operators of critical pipelines (1) report cybersecurity incidents to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) within 24 hours; (2) appoint a cybersecurity coordinator to coordinate with TSA and CISA; and (3) conduct a self-assessment of cybersecurity practices, identify any gaps, and develop a plan and timeline for remediation. On July 27, 2022, the TSA issued Security Directive Pipeline-2021-02C (Security Directive 2C), which requires owners/operators of critical pipelines to (1) establish and implement a TSA-approved Cybersecurity Implementation Plan that describes the specific cybersecurity measures employed and the schedule for achieving the cybersecurity outcomes described in Security Directive 2C; (2) develop and maintain a Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan to reduce the risk of operational disruption or other significant impacts from a cybersecurity incident; and (3) establish a Cybersecurity Assessment Program and submit an annual plan describing how the effectiveness of cybersecurity measures will be assessed. We have established and received TSA approval for our Cybersecurity Implementation Plan and are compliant with the remaining requirements established in Security Directives 1B and 2C. New regulations or security directives issued by TSA may impose additional requirements applicable to our cybersecurity program, which could cause us to incur increased capital and operating costs and operational delays. See Risk Factors A breach of our information technology infrastructure, including a breach caused by a cybersecurity attack on us or third parties with whom we are interconnected, may interfere with the safe operation of our assets, result in the disclosure of personal or proprietary information, and harm our reputation.

 RISK FACTORS 
 You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information in this report. If any of the risks discussed below occur, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and, in some cases our reputation, could be materially adversely affected. Each of these factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. 
 Risks Inherent to Our Industry and Business 
 Our natural gas transportation and storage activities involve numerous risks and hazards that might result in accidents and unforeseen interruptions . 
 Our operations are subject to all the risks and hazards typically associated with the transportation and storage of natural gas including, but not limited to: 
 Aging infrastructure and mechanical problems; 
 
 Damages to pipelines and pipeline blockages or other pipeline interruptions; 
 
 Uncontrolled releases of natural gas; 
 
 Operator error; 
 
 Damage caused by third party activity, such as operation of construction equipment; 
 
 Pollution and other environmental risks; 
 
 Fires, blowouts, cratering, and explosions; and 
 
 Security risks, including cybersecurity. 
 Any of these risks could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, loss of services to our customers, reputational damage, and substantial losses to us. The location of certain segments of our pipeline in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. An event such as those described above could cause considerable harm and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance.

 We provide some services pursuant to long-term, fixed-price contracts. It is possible that costs to perform services under such contracts will exceed the revenues we collect for our services. Although other services are priced at cost-based rates that are subject to adjustment in rate cases, under FERC policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a negotiated rate that may be above or below the FERC regulated cost-based rate for that service. These negotiated rate contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs that could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services. 
 We may not be able to extend or replace expiring natural gas transportation and storage contracts at favorable rates, on a long-term basis, or at all. 
 Our primary exposure to market risk occurs at the time the terms of existing transportation and storage contracts expire or are subject to termination. Upon expiration or termination of our existing contracts, we may not be able to extend such contracts with existing customers or obtain replacement contracts at favorable rates, on a long-term basis or at all. Failure to extend or replace a significant portion of our existing contracts may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Our ability to extend or replace existing customer contracts on favorable terms is subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: 
 
 The level of existing and new competition to deliver natural gas to our markets and competition from alternative fuel sources such as electricity, renewable resources, coal, fuel oils, or nuclear energy; 
 
 Pricing, demand, availability, and margins for natural gas in our markets; 
 
 Whether the market will continue to support long-term firm contracts; 
 
 The effects of regulation on us, our customers, and our contracting practices; and 
 
 The ability to understand our customers expectations, efficiently and reliably deliver high quality services, and effectively manage customer relationships. The results of these efforts will impact our reputation and positioning in the market. 
 Competitive pressures could lead to decreases in the volume of natural gas contracted for or transported through our pipeline system. 
 The principal elements of competition among natural gas transportation and storage assets are rates, terms of service, access to natural gas supplies, flexibility, and reliability. Although most of our pipeline system s current capacity is fully contracted, the FERC has taken certain actions to strengthen market forces in the interstate natural gas pipeline industry that have led to increased competition throughout the industry. Similarly, a highly liquid competitive commodity market in natural gas and increasingly competitive markets for natural gas services, including competitive secondary markets in pipeline capacity, have developed. As a result, pipeline capacity is being used more efficiently, and peaking and storage services are increasingly effective substitutes for annual pipeline capacity. As a result, we could experience some turnback of firm capacity as the primary terms of existing agreements expire. If we are unable to remarket this capacity or can remarket it only at substantially discounted rates compared to previous contracts, we or our remaining customers may have to bear the costs associated with the turned back capacity. 
 We compete primarily with other interstate pipelines and storage facilities in the transportation and storage of natural gas. Some of our competitors may have greater financial resources and access to greater supplies of natural gas than we do. Some of these competitors may expand or construct transportation and storage systems that would create additional competition for natural gas supplies or the services we provide to our customers. Moreover, Williams and its other affiliates may not be limited in their ability to compete with us. In a number of key markets, interstate pipelines are now facing competitive pressure from other major pipeline systems, enabling local distribution companies and end users to choose a transmission provider based on considerations other than location. Other entities could construct new pipelines or expand existing pipelines that could potentially serve the same markets as our pipeline system. Any such new pipelines could offer transportation services that are more desirable to shippers because of locations, facilities, or other factors. These new pipelines could charge rates or provide service to locations that would result in greater net profit for shippers and producers and thereby force us to lower the rates charged for service on our pipeline in order to extend our existing transportation service agreements or to attract new customers. We are aware of proposals by competitors to expand pipeline capacity in certain markets we also serve which, if the proposed projects proceed, could increase the competitive pressure upon us. Further, natural gas also competes with other forms of 
 9

 energy available to our customers, including electricity, coal, fuel oils, and other alternative energy sources. We may not be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Any significant decrease in supplies of natural gas in the supply basins we access or in demand for those supplies in the markets we serve could adversely affect our business and operating results. 
 Our ability to maintain and expand our business depends on the level of drilling and production predominately by third parties in our supply basins. Production from existing wells and natural gas supply basins with access to our pipeline will naturally decline over time. The amount of natural gas reserves underlying these existing wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than anticipated. We do not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas reserves underlying such wells and supply basins with access to our pipeline. Accordingly, we do not have independent estimates of total reserves dedicated to our pipeline or the anticipated life of such reserves. In addition, low prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations, including permitting and environmental regulations, or the lack of available capital for these projects could adversely affect the development and production of additional reserves, as well as gathering, storage, pipeline transportation, and import and export of natural gas supplies. Localized low natural gas prices in one or more of our existing supply basins, whether caused by a lack of infrastructure or otherwise, could also result in depressed natural gas production in such basins and limit the supply of natural gas made available to us. The competition for natural gas supplies to serve other markets could also reduce the amount of natural gas supply for our customers. 
 Demand for our transportation services depends on the ability and willingness of shippers with access to our facilities to satisfy demand in the markets we serve by deliveries through our system. Any decrease in this demand could adversely affect our business. Demand for natural gas is also affected by weather, future industrial and economic conditions, fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, governmental regulation including governmentally imposed constraints such as prohibitions on natural gas hookups in newly constructed buildings, and technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices, all of which are matters beyond our control. 
 A failure to obtain sufficient natural gas supplies or a reduction in demand for our services in the markets we serve could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Significant prolonged changes in natural gas prices could affect supply and demand and cause a reduction in or termination of our long-term transportation and storage contracts or throughput on our system. 
 Higher natural gas prices over the long term could result in a decline in the demand for natural gas and, therefore, in our long-term transportation and storage contracts or throughput on our system. Also, lower natural gas prices over the long term could result in a decline in the production of natural gas, resulting in reduced contracts or throughput on our system. As a result, significant prolonged changes in natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Our costs of testing, maintaining, or repairing our facilities may exceed our expectations, and the FERC may not allow, or competition in our markets may prevent, our recovery of such costs in the rates we charge for our services. 
 We have experienced and could experience in the future unexpected leaks or ruptures on our gas pipeline system or storage facilities. Either as a preventative measure or in response to a leak or another issue, we could be required by regulatory authorities to test or undertake modifications to our systems. If the cost of testing, maintaining, or repairing our facilities exceed expectations and the FERC does not allow us to recover, or competition in our markets prevents us from recovering, such costs in the rates that we charge for our services, such costs could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 The operation of our businesses might be adversely affected by regulatory proceedings, changes in government regulations or in their interpretation or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or our customers. 
 Public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry has resulted in the proposal and/or implementation of increased regulations. Such scrutiny has also resulted in various inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings, including litigation of energy industry matters. Both the customers on our system and regulators have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances. Any successful challenge could materially affect our results of operations. 
 Certain inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings are ongoing. Adverse effects may continue as a result of the uncertainty of these ongoing inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings, or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. In addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether 
 10 

Table of Contents 

 these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us, civil or criminal fines and/or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation, which might be materially adverse to the operation of our business and our revenues and net income or increase our operating costs in other ways. Current legal proceedings or other matters, including environmental matters, suits, regulatory appeals, and similar matters, might result in adverse decisions against us which, among other outcomes, could result in the imposition of substantial penalties and fines and could damage our reputation. The result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance. 
 In addition, existing regulations, including those pertaining to financial assurances to be provided by our businesses in respect of potential asset decommissioning and abandonment activities, might be revised, reinterpreted, or otherwise enforced in a manner that differs from prior regulatory action. New laws and regulations might also be adopted or become applicable to us, our customers, or our business activities. The change in the U.S. governmental administration and its policies may increase the likelihood of such legal and regulatory developments. If new laws or regulations are imposed relating to oil and gas extraction, or if additional or revised levels of reporting, regulation, or permitting moratoria are required or imposed, including those related to hydraulic fracturing, the volumes of natural gas that we transport could decline, our compliance costs could increase, and our results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks. 
 Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices. Investor advocacy groups, institutional investors, investment funds, and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments. Regardless of the industry, investors increased focus and activism related to ESG (as proponents or opponents) and similar matters may hinder access to capital, as investors may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a result of their assessment of a company s ESG practices. Companies that do not adapt to or comply with investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which are evolving, or that are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, may suffer from reputational damage and the business, financial condition, and/or stock price of such a company could be materially and adversely affected. 
 We face pressures from our stakeholders, who are increasingly focused on climate change, to prioritize sustainable energy practices, reduce our carbon footprint and promote sustainability. Our stakeholders may require us to implement ESG procedures or standards in order to continue engaging with us, to remain invested in us, or before they will make further investments in us. Additionally, we may face reputational challenges in the event our ESG procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by certain constituencies. We adopted certain practices as highlighted in Williams 2021 Sustainability Report, including with respect to air emissions, biodiversity and land use, climate change, and environmental stewardship. It is possible, however, that our stakeholders might not be satisfied with our sustainability efforts or the speed of their adoption. If we do not meet our stakeholders expectations, our business and/or our ability to access capital could be harmed. 
 Additionally, adverse effects upon the oil and gas industry related to the worldwide social and political environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from climate change, changes in political leadership and environmental policies, changes in geopolitical-social views toward fossil fuels and renewable energy, concern about the environmental impact of climate change, and investors expectations regarding ESG matters, may also adversely affect demand for our services. Any long-term material adverse effect on the oil and gas industry could have a significant financial and operational adverse impact on our business. 
 The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 
 We may be subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change. 
 The threat of global climate change may create physical and financial risks to our business. Energy needs vary with weather conditions. To the extent weather conditions may be affected by climate change, energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of any changes. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in more pipelines and other infrastructure to serve increased demand. A decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect our financial condition through decreased revenues. Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stresses, including service interruptions. Weather conditions outside of our operating territory could also have an impact on our revenues. To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase our cost of providing service. We may not be able to pass on the higher costs to our customers or recover all costs related to mitigating these physical risks. 
 11

 Additionally, many climate models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels and increased frequency and severity of weather events, which may lead to higher insurance costs, or a decrease in available coverage, for our assets in areas subject to severe weather. These climate-related changes could damage our physical assets, especially operations located in low-lying areas near river banks, and facilities situated in rain-susceptible regions. 
 To the extent financial markets view climate change and GHG emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. Climate change and GHG regulation could also reduce demand for our services. Our business could also be affected by the potential for lawsuits against GHG emitters, based on links drawn between GHG emissions and climate change. 
 Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, which may expose us to significant costs, liabilities, and expenditures that could exceed our expectations. 
 Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, endangered and threatened species, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the security of chemical and industrial facilities. Substantial costs, liabilities, delays, and other significant issues related to environmental laws and regulations are inherent in the gathering, transportation, and storage of natural gas as well as waste disposal practices and construction activities. New or amended environmental laws and regulations can also result in significant increases in capital costs we incur to comply with such laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, the imposition of stricter conditions on or revocation of permits, the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations, and delays or denials in granting permits. 
 Joint and several strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations for the remediation of contaminated areas and in connection with spills or releases of materials associated with natural gas, oil, and wastes on, under, or from our properties and facilities. Private parties, including the owners of properties through which our pipeline system passes and facilities where our wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from our operations. Some sites at which we operate are located near current or former third-party hydrocarbon storage and processing or oil and natural gas operations or facilities, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ours. 
 We are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. In connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. In addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest, or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses. 
 In addition, climate change regulations and the costs that may be associated with such regulations and with the regulation of emissions of GHGs have the potential to affect our business. Regulatory actions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or the passage of new climate change laws or regulations could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, install new emissions controls on our facilities, or administer and manage any GHG emissions program. We believe it is possible that future governmental legislation and/or regulation may require us either to limit GHG emissions associated with our operations or to purchase allowances for such emissions. However, we cannot predict precisely what form these future regulations might take, the stringency of any such regulations or when they might become effective. Several legislative bills have been introduced in the United States Congress that would require carbon dioxide emission reductions. Previously considered proposals have included, among other things, limitations on the amount of GHGs that can be emitted (so called caps together with systems of permitted emissions allowances. These proposals could require us to reduce emissions or to purchase allowances for such emissions. 
 In addition to activities on the federal level, state and regional initiatives could also lead to the regulation of GHG emissions sooner than and/or independent of federal regulation. These regulations could be more stringent than any federal legislation that may be adopted. Future legislation and/or regulation designed to reduce GHG emissions could make some of our activities uneconomic to maintain or operate. We continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments in this area and otherwise take efforts to limit and reduce GHG emissions from our facilities. Although the regulation of GHG emissions may have a material impact on our operations and rates, we believe it is premature to attempt to quantify the potential costs of the impacts.

 If we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 We depend on certain key customers for a significant portion of our revenues. The loss of any of these key customers or the loss of any contracted volumes could result in a decline in our business. 
 We rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues. Although some of these customers are subject to long-term contracts, we may be unable to negotiate extensions or replacements of these contracts on favorable terms, or at all. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our largest customer was Puget Sound Energy, Inc., which accounted for approximately 29.2 percent of our operating revenues. The loss of all, or even a portion of, the revenues from contracted volumes supplied by our key customers, as a result of competition, creditworthiness, inability to negotiate extensions or replacements of contracts, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties and our credit risk management will not be able to completely eliminate such risk. 
 We are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our customers and counterparties in the ordinary course of our business. Generally, our customers are rated investment grade, are otherwise considered creditworthy, are required to make pre-payments or provide security to satisfy credit concerns, or are dependent upon us, in some cases without a readily available alternative, to provide necessary services. However, our credit procedures and policies cannot completely eliminate customer credit risk. Our customers and counterparties include industrial customers, local distribution companies, natural gas producers, and marketers whose creditworthiness may be suddenly and disparately impacted by, among other factors, commodity price volatility, deteriorating energy market conditions, and public and regulatory opposition to energy producing activities. In a low commodity price environment certain of our customers have been or could be negatively impacted, causing them significant economic stress resulting, in some cases, in a customer bankruptcy filing or an effort to renegotiate our contracts. To the extent one or more of our key customers commences bankruptcy proceedings, our contracts with such customers may be subject to rejection under applicable provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code, or, if we so agree, may be renegotiated. Further, during any such bankruptcy proceeding, prior to assumption, rejection, or renegotiation of such contracts, the bankruptcy court may temporarily authorize the payment of value for our services less than contractually required, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. If we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers and counterparties, or otherwise do not take sufficient mitigating actions, including obtaining sufficient collateral, deterioration in their creditworthiness, and any resulting increase in nonpayment and/or nonperformance by them could cause us to write down or write off accounts receivable. Such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur, and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 If third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipeline and facilities become unavailable to transport natural gas, our revenues could be adversely affected. 
 We depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from our pipeline and storage facilities for the benefit of our customers. Because we do not own these third-party pipelines or facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control. If these pipelines or other facilities were to become temporarily or permanently unavailable for any reason, or if throughput were reduced because of testing, line repair, damage to pipelines or facilities, reduced operating pressures, lack of capacity, increased credit requirements or rates charged by such pipelines or facilities, or other causes, we and our customers would have reduced capacity to transport, store or deliver natural gas to end use markets, thereby reducing our revenues. Any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnection causing a material reduction in volumes transported on our pipeline or stored at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 We do not own all of the land on which our pipeline and facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations. 
 We do not own all of the land on which our pipeline and facilities have been constructed. As such, we are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use. In those instances in which we do not own the land on which our facilities are located, we obtain the rights to construct and operate our facilities on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. Our loss of any of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

 We face opposition to operation and expansion of our pipelines and facilities from various individuals and groups. 
 We have experienced, and we anticipate that we will continue to face, opposition to the operation and expansion of our pipelines and facilities from governmental officials, environmental groups, landowners, tribal groups, local groups, and other advocates. In some instances, we encounter opposition that disfavors hydrocarbon-based energy supplies regardless of practical implementation or financial considerations. Opposition to our operation and expansion can take many forms, including the delay or denial of required governmental permits, organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage our operations, intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our assets, or lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt, or delay the operation or expansion of our assets and business. In addition, acts of sabotage or eco-terrorism could cause significant damage or injury to people, property, or the environment or lead to extended interruptions of our operations. Any such event that delays or prevents the expansion of our business, that interrupts the revenues generated by our operations, or which causes us to make significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may not be able to grow or effectively manage our growth. 
 As part of our growth strategy, we engage in significant capital projects. We have a project lifecycle process and an investment evaluation process. These are processes we use to identify, evaluate, and execute on acquisition opportunities and capital projects. We may not always have sufficient and accurate information to identify and value potential opportunities and risks or our investment evaluation process may be incomplete or flawed. Our growth may also be dependent upon the construction of new natural gas gathering, transportation, compression, processing, or treating pipelines and facilities, as well as the expansion of existing facilities. Additional risks associated with construction may include the inability to obtain rights-of-way, skilled labor, equipment, materials, permits, and other required inputs in a timely manner such that projects are completed on time and the risk that construction cost overruns, including due to inflation, could cause total project costs to exceed budgeted costs. Additional risks associated with growing our business include, among others, that: 
 Changing circumstances and deviations in variables could negatively impact our investment analysis, including our projections of revenues, earnings, and cash flow relating to potential investment targets, resulting in outcomes that are materially different than anticipated; 
 
 We could be required to contribute additional capital to support acquired businesses or assets and we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us that exceed our estimates and for which contractual protections are either unavailable or prove inadequate; 
 
 Acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert financial and operational resources from existing operations, and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls, and procedures; and 
 
 Acquisitions and capital projects may require substantial new capital, including the issuance of debt or equity, and we may not be able to access credit or capital markets or obtain acceptable terms. 
 If realized, any of these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, including the possible impairment of our assets, or cash flows. 
 Chemical substances in the natural gas our pipeline systems transport could cause damage or affect the ability of our pipeline systems or third-party equipment to function properly, which may result in increased preventative and corrective action costs and may impact our relationships with our customers. 
 We have identified the presence of a chemical substance, dithiazine, in facilities located on our system. The facilities in which dithiazine has been detected on our system are located downstream of the interconnecting and unaffiliated pipeline of Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN), which has reported the presence of dithiazine in its system. Therefore, we believe that the dithiazine found in our system is attributable to gas received from GTN. 
 Dithiazine may result in improper functioning of equipment if not cleaned properly. We may incur costs and experience operational delays in connection with cleaning dithiazine from our systems. Some of our customers downstream of our facilities have also detected dithiazine in their facilities and any impacts on affected customers may impact our relationships with those customers.

 Risks Related to Strategy and Financing 
 A downgrade of our credit ratings, which are determined outside of our control by independent third parties, could impact our liquidity, access to capital, and our costs of doing business. 
 Downgrades of our credit ratings increase our cost of borrowing and could require us to provide collateral to our counterparties, negatively impacting our available liquidity. In addition, our ability to access capital markets could be limited by a downgrade of our credit ratings. 
 Credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. The analysis includes a number of criteria such as business composition, market and operational risks, as well as various financial tests. Credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time. Credit ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the credit ratings agencies. 
 Our ability to obtain credit in the future could be affected by Williams credit ratings. 
 Substantially all of Williams operations are conducted through its subsidiaries. Williams cash flows are substantially derived from loans, dividends, and distributions paid to it by its subsidiaries. Due to our relationship with Williams, our ability to obtain credit will be affected by Williams credit ratings. If Williams were to experience a deterioration in its credit standing or financial condition, our access to capital and our ratings could be adversely affected. Any downgrading of a Williams credit rating could result in a downgrading of our credit rating. A downgrading of a Williams credit rating could limit our ability to obtain financing in the future upon favorable terms, if at all. 
 Restrictions in our debt agreements and the amount of our indebtedness may affect our future financial and operating flexibility. 
 Our total outstanding long-term debt (including current portion) as of December 31, 2022 was 580.1 million. 
 The agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our ability to incur certain liens to support indebtedness and our ability to merge or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, certain of our debt agreements contain various covenants that restrict or limit, among other things, our ability to make certain distributions during the continuation of an event of default, and to enter into certain affiliate transactions and certain restrictive agreements and to change the nature of our business. Certain of our debt agreements also contain, and those we enter into in the future may contain, financial covenants and other limitations with which we will need to comply. Williams debt agreements contain similar covenants with respect to Williams and its subsidiaries, including us. 
 Our debt service obligations and the covenants described above could have important consequences. For example, they could, among other things: 
 Make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, which could in turn result in an event of default on such indebtedness; 
 
 Impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, general limited liability company purposes, or other purposes; 
 
 Diminish our ability to withstand a continued or future downturn in our business or the economy generally; 
 
 Require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash for working capital, capital expenditures, general limited liability company purposes, or other purposes; and 
 
 Limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, including by limiting our ability to expand or pursue our business activities and by preventing us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us. 
 Our ability to comply with our debt covenants, to repay, extend, or refinance our existing debt obligations and to obtain future credit will depend primarily on our operating performance. Our ability to refinance existing debt obligations or obtain future credit will also depend upon the current conditions in the credit markets and the availability of credit generally. If we are unable to comply with these covenants, meet our debt service obligations, or obtain future credit on favorable terms, or at all, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital, or sell assets. We may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all.

 Our failure to comply with the covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness could result in events of default, which could render such indebtedness due and payable. We may not have sufficient liquidity to repay our indebtedness in such circumstances. In addition, cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions in our debt agreements could cause a default or acceleration to have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. For more information regarding our debt agreements, please read Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Capital Resources and Liquidity and Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 Debt and Financing Arrangements of Notes to Financial Statements. 
 Difficult conditions in the global financial markets and the economy in general could negatively affect our business and results of operations. 
 Our business may be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions or future disruptions in the global financial markets. Included among these potential negative impacts are industrial or economic contraction (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic) leading to reduced energy demand and lower prices for our products and services and increased difficulty in collecting amounts owed to us by our customers. The ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine and the actions undertaken by western nations in response to Russia s actions has had, and may continue to have, adverse impacts on global financial markets. We, along with Williams and Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC, are party to a credit agreement with aggregate commitments available of 3.75 billion, with up to an additional 500 million increase in aggregate commitments available under certain circumstances. We and Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC are each subject to a 500 million borrowing sublimit. As of December 31, 2022, we had a borrowing capacity of 500 million under such credit facility, but our ability to borrow under that facility could be impaired if one or more of our lenders fails to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us. If financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plans or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. In addition, financial markets have periodically been affected by concerns over U.S. fiscal and monetary policies. These concerns, as well as actions taken by the U.S. federal government in response to these concerns, could significantly and adversely impact the global and U.S. economies and financial markets, which could negatively impact us in the manner described above. 
 Williams can exercise substantial control over our distribution policy and our business and operations and may do so in a manner that is adverse to our interests. 
 Because we are an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Williams, Williams exercises substantial control over our business and operations and makes determinations with respect to, among other things, the following: 
 
 Payment of distributions and repayment of advances; 
 
 Decisions on financings and our capital raising activities; 
 
 Mergers or other business combinations; and 
 
 Acquisition or disposition of assets. 
 Williams could decide to increase distributions or advances to our member consistent with existing debt covenants. This could adversely affect our liquidity. 
 Risks Related to Regulations That Affect Our Industry 
 Our natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to regulation by the FERC, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to establish transportation and storage rates that would allow us to recover the full cost of operating our pipeline and storage assets, including a reasonable rate of return. 
 In addition to regulation by other federal, state, and local regulatory authorities, under the NGA, our interstate pipeline transportation and storage services and related assets are subject to regulation by the FERC. Federal regulation extends to such matters as: 
 
 Transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce; 
 
 Rates, operating terms, types of services and conditions of service; 
 
 Certification and construction of new interstate pipeline and storage facilities; 
 
 Acquisition, extension, disposition, or abandonment of existing interstate pipeline and storage facilities;

 Regulatory or administrative actions in these areas, including successful complaints or protests against our rates, can affect our business in many ways, including by decreasing existing tariff rates or setting future tariff rates to levels such that revenues are inadequate to recover increases in operating costs or to sustain an adequate return on capital investments, decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs, and otherwise altering the profitability of our business. 
 Risks Related to Employees and Outsourcing of Support Activities 
 Failure of our service providers or disruptions to outsourcing relationships might negatively impact our ability to conduct our business. 
 We rely on Williams and other third parties for certain services necessary for us to be able to conduct our business. We have a limited ability to control these operations and the associated costs. Certain of Williams accounting and information technology functions that we rely on are currently provided by third-party vendors, and sometimes from service centers outside of the United States. Services provided pursuant to these arrangements could be disrupted. Similarly, the expiration of agreements associated with such arrangements or the transition of services between providers could lead to loss of institutional knowledge or service disruptions. Our reliance on Williams and others as service providers and on Williams outsourcing relationships, and our limited ability to control certain costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Our allocation from Williams for costs for its defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are affected by factors beyond our and Williams control. 
 As we have no employees, employees of Williams and its affiliates provide services to us. As a result, we are allocated a portion of Williams costs for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. The timing and amount of our allocations under the defined benefit pension plans depend upon a number of factors that Williams controls, including changes to pension plan benefits, as well as factors outside of Williams control, such as asset returns, interest rates, and changes in pension laws. Changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase our allocations could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Risks Related to Weather, Other Natural Phenomena and Business Disruption 
 Our assets and operations, as well as our customers assets and operations, can be affected by weather and other natural phenomena. 
 Our assets and operations and our customers assets and operations can be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, landslides, tornadoes, and other natural phenomena and weather conditions, including extreme or unseasonable temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the historic rates of return associated with our assets and operations. A significant disruption in our or our customers operations or the occurrence of a significant liability for which we were not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Our business could be negatively impacted by acts of terrorism and related disruptions. 
 Given the volatile nature of the commodities we transport and store, our assets and the assets of our customers and others in our industry may be targets of terrorist activities. Uncertainty surrounding the Russian invasion of Ukraine, or other sustained military campaigns, may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including the possibility that infrastructure facilities could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terrorism. A terrorist attack could create significant price volatility, disrupt our business, limit our access to capital markets, or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or partial disruption to our ability to transport natural gas. Acts of terrorism, as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with acts of terrorism, could cause environmental repercussions that could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

 A breach of our information technology infrastructure, including a breach caused by a cybersecurity attack on us or third parties with whom we are interconnected, may interfere with the safe operation of our assets, result in the disclosure of personal or proprietary information, and harm our reputation. 
 
 We rely on our information technology infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information, including information we use to safely operate our assets. In addition to the oversight of our business provided by our Management Committee, the Williams Board of Directors has oversight responsibility with regard to enterprise-wide assessment of the major risks inherent in its businesses, including cybersecurity risks. Accordingly, the Williams Board of Directors reviews management s efforts to address and mitigate such risks, including the establishment and implementation of policies to address cybersecurity threats. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant time, manpower, and capital in our information technology infrastructure. However, the age, operating systems, or condition of our current information technology infrastructure and software assets and our ability to maintain and upgrade such assets could affect our ability to resist cybersecurity threats. While we believe that we maintain appropriate information security policies, practices, and protocols, we regularly face cybersecurity and other security threats to our information technology infrastructure, which could include threats to our operational industrial control systems and safety systems that operate our pipelines, plants, and assets. We face unlawful attempts to gain access to our information technology infrastructure, including coordinated attacks from hackers, whether state-sponsored groups, hacktivists , or private individuals. We face the threat of theft and misuse of sensitive data and information, including customer and employee information. We also face attempts to gain access to information related to our assets through attempts to obtain unauthorized access by targeting acts of deception against individuals with legitimate access to physical locations or information. We also are subject to cybersecurity risks arising from the fact that our business operations are interconnected with third parties, including third-party pipelines, other facilities, and our contractors and vendors. In addition, the breach of certain business systems could affect our ability to correctly record, process, and report financial information. Breaches in our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities, or other disruptions, including those arising from theft, vandalism, fraud, or unethical conduct, which may increase as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, could result in damage to or destruction of our assets, unnecessary waste, safety incidents, damage to the environment, reputational damage, potential liability, the loss of contracts, the imposition of significant costs associated with remediation and litigation, heightened regulatory scrutiny, increased insurance costs, and have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 General Risk Factors 
 We do not insure against all potential risks and losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the inability of our insurers to satisfy our claims. 
 In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, risks and losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. The occurrence of any risks not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and our ability to repay our debt. 
 A failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively impact our results of operations. 
 Events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skill sets to future needs, or unavailability of contract labor may lead to operating challenges such as lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development, including with the workforce needs associated with projects and ongoing operations. Williams failure to hire and adequately obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor, may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate the businesses. If Williams is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, including members of senior management, results of operations could be negatively impacted.

 Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 While it is not possible for us to predict the final outcome of any pending legal proceedings involving governmental authorities under federal, state, and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, we do not anticipate a material effect on our financial position if we were to receive an unfavorable outcome in any one or more of such proceedings. Our threshold for disclosing material environmental legal proceedings involving a governmental authority where potential monetary sanctions are involved is 1 million.

 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 General 
 The following discussion of critical accounting estimates, results of operations, and capital resources and liquidity should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included within Part II, Item 8 of this report. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. We believe that the nature of these estimates and assumptions is material due to the subjectivity and judgment necessary, or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of these on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 Regulatory Accounting 
 We are regulated by the FERC. Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 980, Regulated Operations, (Topic 980) provides that certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense should be deferred as regulatory assets, based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates. Likewise, certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise reduce expense should be deferred as regulatory liabilities, based on the expected return to customers in future rates. Management's expected recovery of deferred costs and return of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by regulators granting such ratemaking treatment. We record certain incurred costs and obligations as regulatory assets or liabilities if, based on regulatory orders or other available evidence, it is probable that the costs or obligations will be included in amounts allowable for recovery or refunded in future rates. 
 Accounting for businesses that are regulated and apply the provisions of Topic 980 can differ from the accounting requirements for non-regulated businesses. Transactions that are recorded differently as a result of regulatory accounting requirements include the capitalization of an equity return component on regulated capital projects, capitalization of other project costs, retirements of general plant assets, employee related benefits, environmental costs, negative salvage, asset retirement obligations and other costs and taxes included in, or expected to be included in, future rates. As a rate-regulated entity, our management has determined that it is appropriate to apply the accounting prescribed by Topic 980 and, accordingly, the accompanying financial statements include the effects of the types of transactions described above that result from regulatory accounting requirements. Management s assessment of the probability of recovery or pass through of regulatory assets and liabilities requires judgment and interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders. If, for any reason, we cease to meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment for all or part of our operations, the regulatory assets and liabilities related to those portions ceasing to meet such criteria would be eliminated from the Balance Sheet and included in the Statement of Net Income for the period in which the discontinuance of regulatory accounting treatment occurs, unless otherwise required to be recorded under other provisions of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The aggregate amount of regulatory assets reflected on the Balance Sheet is 29.5 million at December 31, 2022. The aggregate amount of regulatory liabilities reflected on the Balance Sheet is 416.9 million at December 31, 2022. A summary of regulatory assets and liabilities is included in Note 11 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities of Notes to Financial Statements. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 This analysis discusses financial results of our operations for the years 2022 and 2021. Variances due to changes in natural gas prices and transportation volumes have little impact on revenues, because under our rate design methodology, the majority of overall cost of service is recovered through firm capacity reservation charges in our transportation rates. 
 Net Income for the year ended December 31, 2022 of 136.8 million increased 1.3 million, or 1 percent, when compared to the 135.5 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021 due to the following significant variances: 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 Operating Revenues increased 3.8 million, or 1 percent, primarily driven by an increase in Other from higher park and loan services and an increase in Natural gas transportation from higher firm transportation in 2022. 
 Operating Expenses increased 8.4 million, or 3 percent, primarily due to: 
 8.2 million increase in Operation and maintenance expenses primarily due to higher outside service costs for routine activities; 
 2.5 million increase in General and administrative expenses due to higher allocated corporate expenses related to information technology; and 
 1.2 million increase in Depreciation and amortization from additional assets placed in service; partially offset by 
 4.0 million favorable change in Regulatory charges resulting from tax rate changes due to an adjustment to the Customer Tax Refund regulatory liability (see Note 11 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities). 
 Other (Income) and Other Expenses had a 5.9 million favorable change primarily due to (i) an increase in interest income on our advances to Williams due to rising interest rates, (ii) favorable changes in allowance for funds used during construction as a result of higher capitalized construction costs and (iii) an increase in the tax gross-up on prepayments received for reimbursable projects in 2022, partially offset by (iv) an increase in interest expense associated with the Customer Tax Refund regulatory liability mentioned above. 
 
 Capital Resources and Liquidity 
 Method of Financing 
 We fund our capital requirements with cash flows from operating activities, equity contributions from Williams, advances from Williams, accessing capital markets, and, if required, borrowings under the credit facility described below. 
 We may raise capital through private debt offerings, as well as offerings registered pursuant to offering-specific registration statements. Interest rates, market conditions, and industry conditions will affect future amounts raised, if any, in the capital markets. We anticipate that we will be able to access public and private debt markets on terms commensurate with our credit ratings to finance our capital requirements, when needed. 
 We, along with Williams and Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco), are co-borrowers under a 3.75 billion unsecured credit facility. Total letter of credit capacity available to Williams under the credit facility is 500 million. We may borrow up to 500 million under the credit facility to the extent not otherwise utilized by Williams and Transco. See Note 6 Debt and Financing Arrangements of Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion of the credit facility. 
 We are a participant in Williams cash management program, and we make advances to and receive advances from Williams. At December 31, 2022, our advances to Williams totaled approximately 310.6 million. These advances are represented by demand notes. See Note 9 Transactions with Major Customers and Affiliates of Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 We categorize our capital expenditures as either maintenance capital expenditures or expansion capital expenditures. Maintenance capital expenditures are those expenditures required to maintain the existing operating capacity and service capability of our assets, including replacement of system components and equipment that are worn, obsolete, completing their useful life, or necessary to remain in compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Expansion capital expenditures improve the service capability of existing assets, extend useful lives, increase transmission or storage capacities from existing levels, reduce costs, or enhance revenues. We anticipate 2023 capital expenditures will be approximately 8 million for expansion projects and 152 million for maintenance projects. In 2023, we expect to fund our capital expenditures with cash from operations.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Management Committee and Member of Northwest Pipeline LLC 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Northwest Pipeline LLC (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of net income, changes in member s equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account s or disclosure s to which it relates.

Description of the Matter 
 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities 
 As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company is an interstate natural gas transmission company that is regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC and applies accounting principles in Topic 980 for regulated operations. As such, certain incurred costs that would otherwise be charged to expense are deferred as regulatory assets, based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates. Likewise, certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise reduce expense are deferred as regulatory liabilities, based on the expected return to customers in future rates. The Company records items as regulatory assets or liabilities if, based on regulatory orders or other available evidence, it is probable that the costs or obligations will be included in amounts allowable for recovery or refunded in future rates. 
 Auditing regulatory assets and liabilities is complex as it requires specialized knowledge of rate-regulated activities and judgments about matters that could affect the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company s accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities, including, among others, controls over the evaluation of filings with regulatory bodies and their effects on existing regulatory assets and liabilities, including factors that may affect the timing or nature of recoverability. 
 We performed audit procedures that included, among others, reviewing evidence of correspondence with regulatory bodies to test that the Company evaluated information obtained from regulatory rulings. For example, we assessed the recoverability, considering information obtained from the Company s stipulation and settlement agreement, for various regulatory assets. In addition, we tested calculations of material regulatory assets and liabilities, including that amortization for certain regulatory assets and liabilities corresponded to relevant regulatory filings and/or orders. For example, we tested whether the calculation of regulatory liabilities attributable to changes in tax rates was consistent with methods agreed to by regulatory bodies.

, we had no such rate refund liabilities. 
 In the course of providing transportation services to customers, we may receive different quantities of natural gas from customers than the quantities delivered on behalf of those customers or consumed in fuel to operate our system. The resulting customer imbalances are typically settled through the receipt or delivery of gas in the future based on the timelines outlined in Northwest s tariff, whereas the over/under recovery of fuel is cleared up through Northwest s semi-annual fuel tracker. Customer imbalances to be repaid or recovered in-kind are recorded as Exchange gas due from others or Exchange gas due to others in our Balance Sheet. The under recovery of fuel is recorded as a Regulatory Asset and the over recovery is recorded as a Regulatory Liability. These imbalances are valued at published spot rates.

to years. Payment provisions in certain of our lease agreements contain escalation factors which may be based on stated rates or a change in a published index at a future time. The amount by which a lease escalates based on the change in a published index, which is not known at lease commencement, is considered a variable payment and is not included in the present value of the future lease payments, which only includes those that are stated or can be calculated based on the lease agreement at lease commencement. In addition to the noncancellable periods, many of our lease agreements provide for one or more extensions of the lease agreement for periods ranging from one year in length to an indefinite number of times following the specified contract term. Other lease agreements provide for extension terms that allow us to utilize the identified leased asset for an indefinite period of time so long as the asset continues to be utilized in our operations. In consideration of these renewal features, we assess the term of the lease agreements, which includes using judgment in the determination of which renewal periods and termination provisions, when at our sole election, will be reasonably certain of being exercised. Periods after the initial term or extension terms that allow for either party to the lease to cancel the lease are not considered in the assessment of the lease term. Additionally, we have elected to exclude leases with an original term of one year or less, including renewal periods, from the calculation of the lease liability and the offsetting right-of-use asset. 
 We use judgment in determining the discount rate upon which the present value of the future lease payments is determined. This rate is based on a collateralized interest rate corresponding to the term of the lease agreement using company, industry, and market information available.

 We record a liability and increase the basis in the underlying asset for the present value of each expected future asset retirement obligation (ARO) at the time the liability is initially incurred, typically when the asset is acquired or constructed. Measurement of ARO includes, as a component of future expected costs, an estimate of the price that a third party would demand, and could expect to receive, for bearing the uncertainties inherent in the obligations, sometimes referred to as market-risk premium. We measure changes in the liability due to passage of time by applying an interest method of allocation. This amount is recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the liability and is offset by a regulatory asset. The gross regulatory asset balances associated with ARO as of and 2021 were million and million, respectively. The regulatory asset is expected to be fully recovered through the negative salvage component of depreciation included in our rates; as such, that amount of the negative salvage component of accumulated depreciation has been reclassified and netted against the amount of the ARO regulatory asset to result in a regulatory liability of million and million at and 2021, respectively.

The Settlement establishes a moratorium on any Natural Gas Act of 1938, as amended (NGA) Section 4 or 5 proceedings that would seek to place new rates in effect any earlier than January 1, 2026. The Settlement also provides that we will file an NGA Section 4 general rate case with rates to be effective not later than April 1, 2028, unless (a) we have entered into a pre-filing settlement or (b) a Section 5 general rate case has been filed on or before April 1, 2028.

 , two meter stations are still being remediated. During 2006 to 2018, 14 compressor stations were evaluated, of which 11 required remediation. As of , five compressor stations are still being remediated. At , we had accrued liabilities totaling approximately million , million of which is recorded in Accrued liabilities - Othe r and million of which is recorded in Other Long-Term Liabilities - Other on the Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2021, we had accrued liabilities totaling approximately million , million of which is recorded in Accrued liabilities - Other and million of which is recorded in Other Long-Term Liabilities - Other on the Balance Sheet. We are conducting environmental assessments and implementing a variety of remedial measures that may result in increases or decreases in the total estimated costs. 
 The EPA and various state regulatory agencies routinely propose and promulgate new rules, and issue updated guidance to existing rules. These rulemakings include, but are not limited to, rules for reciprocating internal combustion engine and combustion turbine maximum achievable control technology, review and updates to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, and rules for new and existing source performance standards for volatile organic compounds and methane. We continuously monitor these regulatory changes and how they may impact our operations. Implementation of new or modified regulations may result in impacts to our operations and increase the cost of additions to Total property, plant, and equipment, net on the Balance Sheet for both new and existing facilities in affected areas; however, due to regulatory uncertainty on final rule content and applicability timeframes, we are unable to reasonably estimate the cost of these regulatory impacts at this time. 
 Other Matters 
 Various other proceedings are pending against us and are considered incidental to our operations.

 Restrictive Debt Covenants 
 At , none of our debt instruments restrict the amount of distributions to our parent, provided, however, that under the credit facility described below, we are restricted from making distributions to our parent during an event of default if we have directly incurred indebtedness under the credit facility. Our debt agreements contain restrictions on our ability to incur secured debt beyond certain levels. 
 Credit Facility 
 In October 2021, we along with Williams and Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco), the lenders named therein, and an administrative agent entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (Credit Agreement) that reduced aggregate commitments available from billion to billion, with up to an additional million increase in aggregate commitments available under certain circumstances. The Credit Agreement was effective on October 8, 2021. The maturity date of the credit facility is October 8, 2026. However, the co-borrowers may request up to two extensions of the maturity date each for an additional one-year period to allow a maturity date as late as October 8, 2028, under certain circumstances. The Credit Agreement allows for swing line loans up to an aggregate of million, subject to available capacity under the credit facility, and letters of credit commitments of million. We and Transco are each able to borrow up to million under this credit facility to the extent not otherwise utilized by the other co-borrowers. At December 31, 2022, letters of credit have been issued and loans to Williams were outstanding under the credit facility. 
 The Credit Agreement contains the following terms and conditions: 
 Various covenants may limit, among other things, a borrower s and its material subsidiaries ability to grant certain liens supporting indebtedness, merge or consolidate, sell all or substantially all of its assets in certain

 billion commercial paper program that has been reduced to billion in connection with the October 2021 Credit Agreement.

During 2022, 2021, and 2020, we received credits from Williams related to retiree medical and life insurance benefits of million, million and million, respectively. These credits were recorded as regulatory liabilities. 
 We have been allowed by rate case settlements to collect or refund in future rates any differences between the actuarially determined costs and amounts currently being recovered in rates related to other postretirement benefits. Any differences between the annual actuarially determined cost and amounts currently being recovered in rates are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities and collected or refunded through future rate adjustments. The amounts of other postretirement benefits costs deferred as regulatory liabilities at and 2021 are million and million, respectively.

 Employee Stock-Based Compensation Plan Information

The Plan permits the granting of various types of awards including, but not limited to, restricted stock units and stock options. Awards may be granted for no consideration other than prior and future services or based on certain financial performance targets achieved. 
 Williams currently bills us directly for compensation expense related to stock-based compensation awards based on the fair value of the awards. We are also billed for our proportionate share of Williams and other affiliates stock-based compensation expense through various allocation processes.

and 2021, our advances to Williams totaled approximately million and million, respectively. These advances are represented by demand notes and are classified as Receivables - Advances to affiliate on the Balance Sheet. The interest rate on these intercompany demand notes is based upon the daily overnight investment rate paid on Williams excess cash at the end of each month, which was approximately percent at . The interest income from these advances was million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020, respectively. The interest income from these advances was minimal for the year ended December 31, 2021. Such interest income is included in Other (Income) and Other Expenses - Miscellaneous other (income) loss, net on the Statement of Net Income. 
 We have employees. Services necessary to operate our business are provided to us by Williams and certain affiliates of Williams. We reimburse Williams and its affiliates for all direct and indirect expenses incurred or payments made (including salary, bonus, incentive compensation, and benefits) in connection with these services. Employees of Williams also provide general, administrative and management services to us, and we are charged for certain administrative expenses incurred by Williams. These charges are either directly identifiable or allocated to our assets. Direct charges are for goods and services provided by Williams at our request. Allocated charges are based on a three-factor formula, which considers revenues; property, plant, and equipment; and payroll. In management s estimation, the allocation methodologies used are reasonable and result in a reasonable allocation to us of our costs of doing business incurred by Williams. We have recorded million, million, and million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, for these service expenses, which are primarily included in General and administrative and Operation and maintenance expenses on the Statement of Net Income. 
 During January 2023, we declared and paid cash distributions of million to our parent.

 Accretion Changes in estimates of existing obligations (1) Ending balance 
 
 (1) Changes in estimates of existing obligations are primarily due to the annual review process, which considers various factors including inflation rate, current estimates for removal costs, discount rates, and the estimated remaining life of assets. The increase in 2021 is primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate and an increase in the estimated life of the ARO asset s.

 The significant regulatory assets and liabilities include: 
 Fuel Recovery - These amounts reflect the value of the cumulative volumetric difference between the gas retained from our customers and the gas consumed in operations. These amounts are not included in the rate base, but are expected to be recovered or refunded by changing the fuel reimbursement factor in subsequent annual fuel filings. 
 Levelized Depreciation - Levelized depreciation allows contract revenue streams to remain constant over the primary contract terms by recognizing lower than book depreciation in the early years and higher than book depreciation in later years. The depreciation component of the levelized incremental rates will equal the accumulated book depreciation by the end of the primary contract terms. The difference between levelized depreciation and straight-line book depreciation is recorded as a FERC approved regulatory asset or liability and is eliminated over the levelization period.

 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 
 None. 
 
 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, including our Senior Vice President and our Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a - 15(e) and 15d - 15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended) (Disclosure Controls) or our internal control over financial reporting (Internal Controls) will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. We monitor our Disclosure Controls and Internal Controls and make modifications as necessary; our intent in this regard is that the Disclosure Controls and Internal Controls will be modified as systems change and conditions warrant. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our Disclosure Controls was performed as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Senior Vice President and our Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Senior Vice President and our Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that these Disclosure Controls are effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes during the fourth quarter of 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a - 15(f) and 15d - 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management regarding the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Senior Vice President and our Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of , based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 
 45 

Table of Contents 

 (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on our assessment, we concluded that, as of , our internal control over financial reporting was effective. 
 This annual report does not include a report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. A report by our registered public accounting firm is not required pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report.

Item 14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services 
 
 Fees for professional services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm in each of the last two fiscal years in each of the following categories are (in millions): 
 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Audit fees 0.6 0.6 Audit-related fees Tax fees All other fees Total fees 0.6 0.6 
 Fees for audit services include fees associated with the annual audit, the reviews for our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, the reviews for other SEC and FERC filings, and accounting consultation. 
 As a wholly owned subsidiary of Williams, we do not have a separate audit committee. The Williams Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of Ernst Young LLP (EY) as such appointment relates to us and Williams other affiliates. The Williams Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the determination of fees associated with EY s audit of our financial statements. The Williams Audit Committee has established a policy regarding pre-approval of all audit and non-audit services provided by EY to Williams and its affiliates. On an ongoing basis, management presents specific projects and categories of service, including projects and categories of service relating to us, to the Williams Audit Committee to request advance approval. The Williams Audit Committee reviews those requests and advises management if the Williams Audit Committee approves the engagement of EY. On a periodic basis, management reports to the Williams Audit Committee regarding the actual spending for such projects and services compared to the approved amounts. The Williams Audit Committee may also delegate the authority to pre-approve audit and permitted non-audit services, excluding services related to internal control over financial reporting, to a subcommittee of one or more committee members, provided that any such pre-approvals are reported on at a subsequent Williams Audit Committee meeting.
