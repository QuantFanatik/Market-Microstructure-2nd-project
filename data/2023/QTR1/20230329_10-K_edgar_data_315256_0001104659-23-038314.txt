ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH 

 APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 

Management of The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly The Bank of New
York), BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware (formerly BNYM (Delaware)) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly The Bank
of New York Trust Company, N.A.), (collectively, the Company is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
Company s management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable in regard to the servicing platform as of and for
the period as follows: 

Platform : Publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting
initially required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) asset-backed securities issued on or after January 1,
2006 that are subject to Regulation AB (including transactions subject to Regulation AB by contractual obligation) for which the Company
provides trustee, securities administration, paying agent or custodial services, as defined and to the extent applicable in the transaction
agreements, other than residential mortgage-backed securities and other mortgage-related asset-backed securities (the Platform ). 

Period : The twelve months ended December 31, 2022 (the
 Period ). 

Applicable Servicing Criteria : All servicing criteria set forth
in Item 1122(d), to the extent required by the related transaction agreements as to any transaction, except as set forth in the column
titled Not Applicable to Platform in Appendix 1 attached hereto. 

With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi),
the Company s management has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by the servicing criterion. The Company s
management has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB,
and the Company s management has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criterion applicable
to this vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI
200.06 ). The Company s management has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the
vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criterion applicable to the vendor. The Company s
management is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and related
servicing criterion. 

With respect to the Platform as of and for the Period, the Company
provides the following assessment of compliance in respect of the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 

1. The Company s management is responsible for assessing the
Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

2. The Company s management has assessed compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria, including the servicing criterion for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described
above as of and for the Period. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission
in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 

3. With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(i), for certain
transactions in the Platform the Trustor (as such term is defined in the related transaction agreements) may direct the Trustee (as such
term is defined in the related transaction agreements) to file, or cause to be filed, all filings identified by the Trustor to be necessary
to maintain the effectiveness of any original filings identified by the Trustor to be necessary under the Uniform Commercial Code as
in effect in any jurisdiction to perfect the Trustee s security interest in or lien on the Underlying Securities (as such term
is defined in the related transaction agreements). As of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company was not
instructed by any Trustors to perform such activities. Absent the receipt of instruction from a Trustor to perform such activities, the
Company s responsibility for criterion 1122(d)(4)(i) for the Platform is solely with regard to the manner of holding trust
assets and investment of trust assets in eligible investments and the Company does not have any duties as to the original UCC filing
and any continuations to perfect the security interest unless instructed to do so by other parties in the transaction agreement. 

4. Based on such assessment, as of and for the Period, the Company
has complied, in all material respects, with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued
an attestation report with respect to management s assessment of the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria
as of and for the Period.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors of 

 Public Service Company of New Hampshire 

 Hartford, Connecticut 

We have examined management's assertion for the Public Service Company
of New Hampshire and subsidiaries PSNH or the Company regarding compliance with the servicing criteria set
forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB Regulation AB for the Rate Reduction Bonds
Series 2018-1 (the Platform as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, excluding criteria items 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iii),
1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4 )(iii), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii),
1122(d)(4)(xiii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which management has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the Company with
respect to the Platform. PSNH s management is responsible for the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management's assertion about the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the servicing activities related to the Platform, determining whether the Company
performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company
during the period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included servicing activities related to each item
included in the Platform. An examination involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about management s assertion. The nature,
timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
management s assertion, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance with the
servicing criteria. 

In our opinion, management's assertion that the Company complied with
the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

The Board of Directors 

 The Bank of New York Mellon 

 BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware 

 The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A.: 

We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying
Management s Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria that The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly The Bank of
New York), BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware (formerly BNYM (Delaware)) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly The
Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.), (collectively, the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB (the Servicing Criteria) for the publicly-issued (i.e.,
transaction-level reporting initially required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) asset-backed securities issued
on or after January 1, 2006 that are subject to Regulation AB (including transactions subject to Regulation AB by contractual obligation)
for which the Company provides trustee, securities administration, paying agent, or custodial services, as defined and to the extent
applicable in the transaction agreements, other than residential mortgage-backed securities and other mortgage-related asset-backed securities
(the Platform ), except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(iv),
1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii),
1122(d)(4)(xiv) and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect
to the Platform (the Servicing Criteria), as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. With respect to Servicing Criterion
1122(d)(4)(i), the Company has determined that for certain transactions in the Platform the Trustor (as such term is defined in the related
transaction agreements) may direct the Trustee (as such term is defined in the related transaction agreements) to file, or cause to be
filed, all filings identified by the Trustor to be necessary to maintain the effectiveness of any original filings identified by the
Trustor to be necessary under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any jurisdiction to perfect the Trustee s security interest
in or lien on the Underlying Securities (as such term is defined in the related transaction agreements). Management s Assessment
of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria indicates that as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company
was not instructed by any Trustors to perform such activities. Absent the receipt of instruction from a Trustor to perform such activities,
the Company s responsibility for Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(4)(i) for the Platform is solely with regard to the manner of
holding trust assets and investment of trust assets in eligible investments and the Company does not have any duties as to the original
UCC filing and any continuations to perfect the security interest unless instructed to do so by other parties in the transaction agreement.
With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii), the Company has determined that there were no activities performed during the twelve
months ended December 31, 2022 with respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the
Company to perform such activities. Appendix A to Management s Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria identifies
the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible
for the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion
about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis,
evidence about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform,
testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions
and performed those selected activities in compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected
transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed
to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts
calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions.
We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on
the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. 

We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities
in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the examination engagement. 

As described in the accompanying Management s Assessment of
Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, for Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform the
activities required by this Servicing Criterion. The Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer
