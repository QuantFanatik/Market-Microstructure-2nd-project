 PART I Item 1. Business Historical background Target Group Inc. Target Group or the Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 2, 2013, under our original name of River Run Acquisition Corporation. Effective May 13, 2014, the Company changed its name to Chess Supersite Corporation. On July 3, 2018, we filed an amendment in our Certificate of Incorporation to change our name to Target Group Inc. Effective October 18, 2018, our common stock became eligible for quotation on the OTCQB platform operated by OTC Markets Group Inc, under the symbol CBDY . The global spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to have a significant impact on the Canadian and global economy and customer purchasing behavior, while equity markets remained volatile. However, these factors have not impacted the Company s operations, financial results for the year. Cannabis Business-Canada We are now engaged in the cultivation, processing and distribution of curated cannabis products for the adult-use medical and recreational cannabis market in Canada and, where legalized by state legislation, in the United States. We believe that there is a shift in the public s perception of cannabis from a state of prohibition to a state of legalization. In October 2018, Canada became the first major industrialized nation to legalize adult-use cannabis at the national federal level. Cannabis is still heavily regulated. However, the medical use of cannabis is now permitted in up to 29 countries and many more countries have reformed, or are considering reforming, their cannabis uses laws to include the recreational use of cannabis. In the 2016 publication by Deloitte, Insights and Opportunities Recreational Marijuana, the project size of the Canadian adult-use market ranged from CDN 4.9 billion to CDN 8.7 billion annually. In the 2018 publication by Deloitte, A Society in Transition, an Industry Ready to Boom, the projected size of the Canadian adult-use market in 2019 ranged from CDN 1.8 billion to CDN 4.3 billion. The Canadian medical cannabis industry experienced substantial growth since 2014. Health Canada projects the Canadian cannabis market will reach CDN 1.3 billion in annual value by 2024. We intend to position ourselves with a core emphasis on wholesale co-packaging services to accommodate all consumer-packaged goods required for the sophisticated cannabis market in Canada and internationally. This will integrate cannabinoid research, analytical testing, product development and manufacturing. Our product manufacturing will include, but will not be limited to the following: Cannabis flower pods for vaporizer use
 Cannabis extract pods for vaporizer use
 Cannabis pre-rolls
 K-Cup infused coffee and tea pods
 Infused cannabis beverages
 Infused cannabis edibles
 Infused topical products and CBD wellness products.
 
 As of the date of this report, the Company (i.e., Target Group Inc. and its subsidiaries) does not have any operations, employees or corporate offices based in United States. Acquisitions To take advantage of the opportunity resulting from the legalization of adult-use cannabis in Canada, we completed several strategic acquisitions and entered into several significant agreements as follows:

Item 1A Risk Factors. In addition to all other information set out in this Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Report, our business is subject to a number of risks that are uniquely applicable to the cannabis business generally and specifically in the cannabis business in Canada. Other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently consider material, or of which we are not presently aware, may become important factors that affect our future financial condition and results of operations. Some of these risks include but are not limited to the developing situation globally surrounding COVID-19 and its impacts on the overall global economy. If any of the risks discussed below actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially affected. Risks Related to Our Cannabis Business and the Cannabis Industry in the United States Our proposed business is dependent on laws pertaining to the marijuana industry Continued development of the marijuana industry is dependent upon continued legislative authorization and/or voter-approved referenda at the state level. Any number of factors could slow or halt progress in this area. In addition, progress for the industry, while encouraging, is not assured. While there may be ample public support for legislative action, numerous factors impact the legislative process, any one of which could slow or halt the use of marijuana, which could negatively impact our business.

 Cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law. The possession and use of marijuana are illegal under U.S. federal and certain states laws, which may negatively impact our business. The use of marijuana is regulated by both the U.S. federal government and state governments and state and U.S. federal laws regarding marijuana are often in conflict. Federal law criminalizing the use of marijuana pre-empts state laws that legalize the possession and use of marijuana for medical and recreational purposes. Any such changes in the federal government s enforcement of current federal laws could adversely affect our ability to possess or cultivate marijuana. Marijuana is a Schedule 1 controlled substance under the Controlled Substance Act CSA meaning that it has a high potential for abuse, has not currently accepted medical use in the United States, lacks accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and may not be prescribed, marketed or sold in the United States. No drug product containing natural cannabis or naturally-derived cannabis extracts have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in the U.S. or obtained registration from the United States Drug Enforcement Administration DEA for commercial production and the DEA may never issue the registrations required of the commercialization of such products. We will continue to assess potential strategic acquisitions of existing or new businesses in the cannabis industry, should we determine that such activities are in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. Any such pursuit would involve additional risks with respect to the regulation of cannabis, particularly, if the federal government determines to actively enforce all federal laws applicable to cannabis. Laws and regulations affecting the cannabis industry are constantly changing, which could detrimentally affect our business. Local, state and federal marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which require us to incur potentially substantial costs associated with compliance and could alter our business plans. In addition, violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and materially affect our operations. In addition, it is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our business. We cannot predict the nature of any such future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business. Any potential growth in the cannabis industry continues to be subject to new and changing state and local laws and regulations. Continued development of the cannabis industry is dependent upon continued legalization of cannabis at the state level and a number of factors could curtail or halt progress in this area, even where there is public support for legislative action. Any delay or halt in the passing or implementation of legislation legalizing cannabis use, its sale and distribution, or the re-criminalization or restrictions on cannabis use at the state level could negatively impact our business. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws and regulations or their interpretations or applications. It is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be materially adverse to our business. Our potential customers, clients and companies with which we may elect to invest directly may have difficulty accessing the services of U.S. banks which may make it difficult for them to operate. On February 14, 2014, the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network FinCen issued rules allowing banks to legally provide financial services to state-licensed cannabis businesses consistent with the Bank Secrecy Act obligations. A memorandum issued by the U.S. Justice Department to federal prosecutors reiterated the guidance previously given, this time to the financial industry that banks can do business with legal marijuana businesses and may not be prosecuted. However, the FinCen guidelines fall short of the explicit legal authorization that the banking industry had requested the government provide. To date, it is not clear if any banks have relied on the FinCen guidelines to take on legal cannabis companies as clients. Because the use, sale and distribution of cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law, many banks will not accept deposits from or provide other bank services to a business involved with cannabis. The inability to open bank accounts may make it difficult for our existing and potential customers to operate. Operational risks of the cannabis industry. Companies involved in the cannabis industry face intense competition, may have limited access to services of banks, may have substantial burdens on company resources due to litigation, complaints or enforcement actions and are heavily dependent on receiving necessary permits and authorization to engage in the cultivation, possession or distribution of cannabis. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operational histories, significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources and larger client bases than us and there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully compete against these or other companies.

 Risks Related to Our Cannabis Business and the Cannabis Industry in Canada The effects of the legalization of recreational cannabis in Canada are unknown at this time. The Government of Canada approved the Cannabis Act (Bill C-45) which went into effect on October 17, 2018. The Cannabis Act allows for regulated and restricted access to cannabis for recreational adult use in Canada. Under the Cannabis Act, there are significant restrictions on the marketing, branding, product formats and distribution channels allowed under the law. Additional restrictions may be imposed at the provincial level. Any failure by us to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at the federal and provincial level could require changes to our proposed operations; result in regulatory or agency proceedings or investigations, increase compliance costs, fines, penalties or restrictions on our operations or revocation of our licenses and other permits. The recreational adult-use cannabis market in Canada may become oversupplied following the implementation of the Cannabis Act. As a result, in the surge of demand for cannabis as a result of the implementation of the Cannabis Act, we and other cannabis producers in Canada may produce more cannabis that is needed to satisfy the market and we may not be able to export that oversupply into other markets where cannabis use is fully legal under all federal, state and provincial laws thus the available supply of cannabis could exceed demand, resulting in a decline in the market price for cannabis. If this were to occur, there is no assurance that we would be able to generate sufficient revenue to result in profitability. We are required to comply with federal, state or provincial and local laws in each jurisdiction where we conduct our business Various federal, state or provincial and local laws and regulations govern our business in the jurisdictions in which we operate and propose to operate. These laws and regulations include those relating to health and safety and the production, management, transportation and storage of cannabis. Compliance with these laws and regulations requires concurrent compliance with complex federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations requires significant financial and managerial resources. A determination that we are not in compliance with these laws and regulations could harm our business. It is impossible to predict the cost or effect of such laws and regulations on our current and future business. We may seek to enter into strategic alliances or acquisitions with third parties that we believe will have a beneficial impact on our business and there are risks that such alliances or acquisitions will not enhance our business in the desired manner. We may expand, or in the future enter into, alliances or acquisitions with third parties that we believe will complement or enhance our existing business. Our ability to take advantage of existing or new alliances or acquisitions is dependent upon a number of factors such as the availability of suitable candidates and working capital. Future strategic alliances or acquisitions could result in the incurrence of debt, costs and contingent liabilities. In addition, there can be no assurances that future alliances or acquisitions will achieve the expected benefits to our business or that we will be able to consummate future strategic alliances or acquisitions on satisfactory terms, or at all. We may not be able to identify and execute future acquisitions or to successfully manage the impact of such transactions on our business. Acquisitions and/or other strategic business combinations involve many risks including (i) disruption of our existing business; (ii) the distraction of management away from the ongoing oversight of our existing business operations; (iii) incurring additional indebtedness; and (iv) increasing the scope and complexity of our operations. A strategic transaction may result in unforeseen obstacles or costs in implementing the transaction or integrating any acquired business into our existing operations. Our cannabis cultivation business is subject to risks associated with an agricultural business. One of the major aspects of our business operations is cultivating cannabis which is an agricultural process. As such, that part of our business is subject to the risks associated with the agricultural business, including crop failure presented by weather, plant diseases, and similar agricultural risks. Although we will grow our cannabis products indoors under climate-controlled conditions, there can be no assurances that natural elements, such as insects and plant diseases, will not disrupt our production activities or have an adverse effect on our business.

 We may not be able to attract or retain key personnel with sufficient experience in the cannabis industry and we may not be able to attract, develop and retain additional employees required for our development and future success. Our success is dependent to a great extent on the performance of our management team and certain key employees and our ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees who are in high demand. The loss of the services of any key personnel, or an inability to attract other suitably qualified persons when needed, could prevent us from executing our business plan and we may not be able to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, if at all. Currently, we do not maintain any key-person insurance on the lives of any of our key personnel. Furthermore, each director and officer of a company that holds a license is subject to the requirement to obtain and maintain a security clearance from Canada Health under the Cannabis Act. A security clearance is valid for not more than five years and must be renewed before the expiration of the current security clearance. There is no assurance that any of our existing personnel who presently or may in the future require a security clearance will be able to obtain or renew such clearance or that new personnel who require a security clearance be able to obtain one. A failure by an individual in a key operational position to maintain or renew a security clearance could result in a reduction or complete suspension of our operations. Employees As of December 31, 2022, we had 56 employees which include Anthony Zarcone, Chief Executive Officer. We have contracted several independent contractors and consultants to provide a range of information technology and marketing services who do not receive cash compensation but receive shares of our common stock as compensation. This mitigates any need for full or part-time employees for these services. Intellectual Property Protection Our subsidiary CannaKorp Inc. holds the following patents: International Patent Application No. PCT/US20115/013778 Title: METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR PRODUCING HERBAL VAPO Filing Date: January 30, 2015 Ref. No.: B1411.70000WO00 U.S. Provisional Application No.: 61/934.255 Title: CONTAINER POD AND DELIVERY SYSTEM Filing Date: January 31, 2014 Ref. No.: B1411.70000US00 In addition, CannaKorp has proprietary rights to certain trade names, trademarks and service marks which include WISP POD cPOD CANNACUP and WISP . CannaKorp also has certain proprietary formulas and processes involving herbal formulas and flavors, proprietary herbal production processes and an herbal base developed to suspend active ingredients for optimal vaporization. At present, CannaKorp has failed to meet its annuity payments as well as maintenance fees on the 2 referenced patents. Although there has been a lapse and these patents remain unmaintained, there remains the possibility of CannaKorp reinstating these patents if done so in a reasonable amount of time. At this time, management is determining the value maintaining these patents will provide the company. Once management has completed their assessment, the company will proceed accordingly to advance in that determined direction moving forward. Additionally, CannaKorp is actively seeking a JV Partner joint venture partner and/ or a licensor to assist in both marketing and launching the Wisp Vaporizer and Wisp Pods in both the US and Canadian Legal Cannabis/ HEMP markets. Corporate Facilities Our principal executive office is located at 20 Hempstead Drive, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Item 2. Properties We do not own any properties at this time and do not have presently any agreements to acquire any properties.

 Our principal executive office is located at 20 Hempstead Drive, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Our subsidiary, Canary, leases a 44,000 square foot facility located in Norfolk County, Ontario to produce medical and recreational cannabis. Item 3. Legal Proceedings During the year ended December 31, 2019, a terminated employee of Canary has filed a lawsuit against the Company amounting to approximately 1,550,430 (CAD 2,100,000) in Ontario, Canada. Currently, the Company is defending its position and believes that the ultimate decision will be in favor of the Company. A complaint for damages of 150,000 was lodged against CannaKorp by the former Chief Financial Officer of CannaKorp for outstanding professional fees. No claim has been registered. The management is of the view that no material losses will arise in respect of the legal claim at the date of these consolidated financial statements. A claim for damages of 1,375,309 (CAD 1,862,805) was lodged against Company and its directors by the former Chief Financial Officer of the Company for wrongful dismissal.

 PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Our common stock is currently quoted on the OTCQB inter-dealer quotation service maintained by OTC Markets Group Inc. under the symbol CBDY. The following table sets forth the quarterly high and low sales prices of our common stock for the last two fiscal years. Such prices are inter-dealer quotations without retail mark-ups, mark-downs or commissions, and may not represent actual transactions.

For transactions covered by the rule, brokers/dealers must make a special suitability determination for purchasers of the securities and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction prior to sale. The Securities and Exchange Commission SEC also has rules that regulate broker/dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than 5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in that security is provided by the exchange or system. The Penny Stock Rules require a broker/dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker/dealer also must provide the customer with the current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker/dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker/dealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer s confirmation. These disclosure requirements have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock. As a result of these rules, investors may find it difficult to sell their shares. As of the date of this report, we have 617,025,999 shares of common stock issued and outstanding held by 430 stockholders of record. Dividend Policy To date, we have not declared or paid any dividends on our common stock. We currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock. It is anticipated that our future earnings will be retained to finance our continuing development. Although we intend to retain our earnings, if any, to finance the exploration and growth of our business, our Board of Directors has the discretion to declare and pay dividends in the future. Payment of dividends in the future will depend upon our earnings, capital requirements, and any other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities None Item 6. Selected Financial Data. There is no selected financial data required to be filed for a smaller reporting company.

 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations As of December 31, 2022, the Company had not generated significant revenues and had no income or cash flows from operations since inception. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a working capital deficit of 6,358,008 and an accumulated deficit of 30,783,678. The Company s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. At present, the Company is running its operations at its Simcoe Facility cultivating Premium Cannabis and started generating revenue (though its investment in JVCo) within the Canadian wholesale cannabis market. However, the continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon these operations successfully generating cashflow for the Company, financial support from its stockholders, its ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations and/or to successfully locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of the target company with the Company. Balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 Cash and restricted cash On December 31, 2022, we had cash of 223,843 (excluding restricted cash of 8,490) compared to 113,079 (excluding restricted cash of 9,072) as of December 31, 2021. The increase is due to increased cash being provided by investment in the joint venture which reflects net recovery of payments of salaries, rent, and other operating expenses of our subsidiary, Canary, and additional loan provided by a related party offset by payments of a loan to a different related party. The change in restricted cash is due to foreign exchange conversion of balances in Canadian Dollar into United States Dollar. Prepaid asset As of December 31, 2022, we had prepaid expenses of 41,714 compared to 44,567 as of December 31, 2021. The balance represents the security deposit for the leased land for the facility to produce Medical Marijuana. Sales tax recoverable and payable As of December 31, 2022, the Company had nil of gross sales tax recoverable compared to 22,146 as of December 31, 2021 while the Company had 35,254 of gross sales tax payable as of December 31, 2022. Recoverable is due to the sales tax paid by the Company on expenses incurred during the year which are recoverable from the government while payable is due to the sales tax received (after deducting sales tax paid on expenses incurred by the Company) during the year which are payable from the government due to sales conducted by the Joint Venture. Sales tax recoverable allowance on December 31, 2022 is nil (December 31, 2021: 509). Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Company s share of the net identifiable assets of our subsidiaries at the date of acquisition.

On May 1, 2019, the Company completed the construction of its 44,000 square foot cannabis cultivation facility and on May 14, 2019, the Company had submitted a Site Evidence Package to Health Canada as part of the steps to obtain the license to cultivate cannabis at the Company s facility. On October 8, 2019, the Company was granted licenses to cultivate, process and sell cannabis pursuant to the Cannabis Act (Bill C-45). On June 4, 2021, Canary received its Sales License amendment from Health Canada. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities Accounts payable amounting to 2,296,935 as of December 31, 2022, primarily represents consulting and construction services related to fixed asset additions amounting to 154,811, interest on promissory notes and loans amounting to 739,130, outstanding and accrued professional fees amounting to 906,596. Accounts payable amounting to 2,885,909 as of December 31, 2021, primarily represents customer advance for sales amounting to 394,400, consulting and construction services related to fixed asset additions amounting to 163,101, interest on promissory notes and loans amounting to 952,376, outstanding and accrued professional fees amounting to 973,017. Payable to related parties As of December 31, 2022, we had 10,346,465 of the amount payable to related parties as compared to 10,658,800 as of December 31, 2021. The balance primarily represents loans provided by the Company s shareholders and a related party, CLI, management services fee outstanding to the managers of the company, and outstanding amount of 65,000 to be paid to a former shareholder of CannaKorp as part of the settlement agreement. For additional detail, refer to Note 14 in consolidated financial statements. Convertible promissory notes payable Interest amounting to 37 was accrued for the year ended December 31, 2022 (2021: 109). The principal amount outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 480. At both reporting dates, the entire balance was current. All notes maturing prior to the date of this report are outstanding. Income statement for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 Revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 The Company did not generate revenue during the current or the comparable year ended in 2021. However, Canary generated revenues of 3,916,539 (though its investment in JVCo) during the current year ended (2021: 2,198,592) and is represented as a share of income from joint venture on the audited consolidated statement of operations. The revenue represents the sale of cannabis product, and the entire revenue was sold to thirteen customers (2021: ten). Expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 Our expenses are classified primarily into advisory and consultancy fees, management fees, salaries and wages, legal and professional fees, and depreciation expense. The decrease in operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021 is due to decrease in consulting expenses, management fees and depreciation and amortization expense. Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily represented consulting fees of 18,926 (2021: 21,702), management fees of 143,677 (2021: 149,819), legal and professional charges of 243,670 (2021: 232,151) comprising legal, review, accounting and Edgar agent fee, depreciation expense amounting to 885,229 (2021: 971,524).

Table of Contents 
 Changes in other income and expenses were due to: (1) the revaluation of the warrant and convertible debt liabilities on each quarter-end which reduced significantly in magnitude since a significant number of warrants expired during the current year ended; (2) increase in the principal balance of higher interest rate bearing loans led to increased interest expense; (3) started to earning net income from the joint venture, as a result, the share of income has increased significantly; (4) the recovery of interest expense charged on shareholder loan from JVCo operations caused a significant increase in other income; (5) impairment of goodwill related to Canary s acquisition and (6) significant increase in exchange income during the year due to favorable exchange rate. Other income and expenses comprised, change in fair value of derivative and warranty liability amounting to positive 14,383 (2021: positive 2,930,894), (gain) loss on settlement of debt amounting to nil (2021: (26,049)), interest and bank charges amounting to 1,121,595 (2021: 985,634), exchange income of 126,314 (2021: loss of 73,163) other income of 811,464 (2021: 30,769), impairment of inventory in the amount of 99,000 (2021: nil), impairment of goodwill in the amount of 3,315,749 (2021: nil) and share of income from joint venture of 354,736 (2021: loss of 272,995). Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a working capital deficit of 6,358,008 and an accumulated deficit of 30,783,678 (2021: Working capital deficit of 3,459,035 and an accumulated deficit of 26,263,614). The Company is actively seeking various financing operations to meet the working capital requirements. We have relied on equity financing and personal funds for our operations. The proceeds may not be sufficient to effectively develop our business to the fullest extent to allow us to maximize our revenue potential, in which case, we will need additional capital. We will need capital to allow us to invest in development. The Company anticipates that its future operations will generate positive cash flows starting in 2022 provided that it is successful in obtaining additional financing in the foreseeable future. Statement of Cash Flow For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Operating activities Operating activities used cash of 1,014,828 compared to the provided cash of 100,118 during the prior year. This is primarily due to the payments of a number of outstanding balances in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Investing activities Investing activities provided cash of 1,015,040 compared to usage of 1,405,966 during the prior year. The current period cash generation represents the recovery of investment and increased revenue generated by the JVCo offset by improvements to Canary s facility to increase its efficiency and increase cannabis production, and investment made in the JVCo by way of paying operating expenses such as salaries, rent, utilities, etc., which will be reimbursed by the JVCo in the future. The switch from using cash to providing cash is due to the JVCo starting to generate sales leading to reduced funding towards JVCo. Financing activities Financing activities provided cash of 122,674 compared to 1,251,489 for the corresponding period of the prior year. During the current period, cash was provided by a loan advance from a related party offset by payment to another related party while in the prior period, cash was primarily provided by proceeds from private placements.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Target Group, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Target Group, Inc. the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, consolidated statements of stockholders deficit, and consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit, net losses, and negative cash flows from operations. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Valuation of Goodwill Description of the Critical Audit Matter As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. During the year ended December 31, 2022, an Impairment loss was recorded in the amount equal to the excess amount over goodwill carrying value. Auditing management s goodwill impairment test was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required to determine the fair value of the goodwill and underlying business unit. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to significant assumptions, such as the Company s financial forecast, discount rate, and operating costs, which are impacted by expectations about future market and economic conditions. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit To test the estimated fair value of the Company s goodwill and underlying business unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among other things, assessing methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. In addition, we assessed the current financial forecast in light of management s current plans, and we assessed the historical basis of management s estimates based on its current operating results that would result from changes in the assumptions. We have served as the Company s auditor since 2017. March 17, 2023
