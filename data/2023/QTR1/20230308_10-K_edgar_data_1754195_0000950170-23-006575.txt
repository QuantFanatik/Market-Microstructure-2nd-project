 Overv iew

The Company s Subordinate Voting Shares (as hereinafter defined) are listed for trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange CSE under the symbol TRUL and are also traded in the United States on the OTCQX Best Market OTCQX under the symbol TCNNF . 
 Trulieve is a vertically integrated cannabis company and multi-state operator which currently directly holds licenses to operate in eleven states. Headquartered in Quincy, Florida, we are the market leader for quality medical cannabis products and services in Florida and we have market leading retail operations in Arizona, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. By providing innovative, high-quality products across our brand portfolio, we aim to be the brand of choice for medical and adult-use customers in all of the major markets that we serve. We operate in highly regulated markets that require expertise in cultivation, manufacturing, retail and logistics. We have developed proficiencies in each of these functions and are committed to expanding access to high quality cannabis products and delivering exceptional customer experiences. 
 All of the states in which we operate have developed programs to permit the use of cannabis products for medicinal purposes to treat specific conditions and diseases, which we refer to as medical cannabis. Recreational cannabis, or adult-use cannabis, is legal cannabis sold in licensed dispensaries to adults ages 21 and older. Thus far, of the states in which we operate, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, and Massachusetts, have already or are in the process of developing and launching programs permitting the commercialization of adult-use cannabis products. Trulieve operates its business through its directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries that hold licenses and have entered into managed service agreements in the states in which they operate.

As of December 31, 2022, we employed over 7,600 people and we are committed to providing patients and adult consumers, which we refer to herein as customers, a consistent and welcoming retail experience across Trulieve branded stores and affiliated retail locations. 
 Our business and operations center around the Trulieve brand philosophy of Customers First which permeates our culture beginning with high-quality and efficient cultivation and manufacturing practices. We focus on the consumer experience at Trulieve branded and affiliated retail locations, our in-house call center and at customer residences through a robust home delivery program. Our investments in vertically integrated operations in several of our markets afford us ownership of the entire supply chain, which mitigates third-party risks and allows us to completely control product quality and brand experience. We believe that this is contributive to high customer retention and brand loyalty. We successfully operate our core business functions of cultivation, production and distribution at scale, and are skilled at rapidly increasing capacity without interruption to existing operations. 
 Trulieve has identified five regional geographic hubs in the U.S. and has established cannabis operations in three of the five hubs: Southeast, Northeast, and Southwest. In each of our three regional hubs we have market leading positions in cornerstone states and additional operations and assets in other state markets. Our hubs are managed by national and regional management teams supported by our corporate headquarters in Florida. 
 Southeast Hub 
 3 

Our Southeast hub operations are anchored by our cornerstone market of Florida. Trulieve was the first licensed operator in the medical market in Florida with initial sales in 2016. Publicly available reports filed with the Florida Office of Medical Marijuana Use show Trulieve has the most dispensing locations and the greatest dispensing volume across product categories out of all licensed medical marijuana businesses in the state as of December 31, 2022. Trulieve cultivates and produces all of its products in-house and distributes those products to customers in Trulieve branded stores (dispensaries) throughout Florida, as well as via home delivery. 
 In accordance with Florida law, Trulieve grows all of its cannabis in secure enclosed indoor facilities and greenhouse structures. In furtherance of our customer-first focus, we have developed a suite of Trulieve branded products, including flower, edibles, vaporizer cartridges, concentrates, topicals, capsules, tinctures, dissolvable powders, and nasal sprays. This wide variety of products gives customers the ability to select product(s) that consistently deliver the desired effect and in their preferred method of delivery. These products are delivered to customers statewide in Trulieve-branded retail stores and by home delivery. 
 In Georgia, Trulieve GA holds one of two Class 1 Production Licenses in the state and is permitted to cultivate cannabis for the manufacture and sale of low tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC oil. Production facilities are active, producing cannabis oil via hydrocarbon extraction. Dispensaries have been constructed to serve the patients of Georgia, and are ready to open once regulations are finalized. 
 Northeast Hub 
 Our Northeast hub operations are anchored by our cornerstone market of Pennsylvania. We conduct cultivation, processing, and retail operations through direct and indirect subsidiaries with permits for retail operations and grower/processor operations in Pennsylvania. These subsidiaries operate cultivation and processing facilities in Carmichael, McKeesport, and Reading, Pennsylvania to support our affiliated network of retail dispensaries and wholesale distribution network across the state. 
 We operate three medical dispensaries and conduct wholesale sales supported by cultivation and processing in Hancock, Maryland. 
 We operate three retail dispensaries in Massachusetts, serving medical patients and adult use customers in Northampton and adult use customers in Framingham and Worcester. Our retail operations are supported by cultivation and manufacturing operations in Holyoke. We commenced wholesale sales in September 2021. Trulieve was the first to offer sales of clones supporting home grow for residents in the Massachusetts market in August 2021. 
 We operate a medical cannabis dispensary located in Bristol, Connecticut. In February 2023 we obtained a hybrid license and began adult-use cannabis sales in the state. 
 We operate nine medical dispensaries in West Virginia, supported by cultivation and processing operations in Huntington, West Virginia. 
 Southwest Hub 
 Our southwest hub operations are anchored by our cornerstone market of Arizona. In Arizona, Trulieve holds a market-leading retail position with twenty dispensaries, offering medical and adult use customers a wide range of branded and third-party products, including brand partner products, in addition to sales in the wholesale channel. We also serve medical and adult use customers in California. Trulieve conducts wholesale operations in Colorado, serving the medical and adult use markets. 
 Cultivation and Processing Capacity 
 Trulieve produces high quality cannabis flower for direct consumption and uses a variety of processes to transform this high-quality biomass into the extensive portfolio of products sold in our stores and in our wholesale channels. Our prominence in our cornerstone market of Florida demonstrates the quality and affordability of the product we produce at scale. With a focus on replicable, scalable operations, we have detailed design standards, standard operating procedures, and training protocols that are employed across cultivation sites to achieve a high level of consistency and quality. 
 In our cornerstone market of Florida, Trulieve cultivates, processes, and manufactures all cannabis products sold in our Florida dispensaries. In other markets including Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, we have achieved varying percentages of vertical integration with cultivation and processing operations to support our retail and wholesale businesses. Trulieve employs an in-house quality team as well as testing laboratories, both of which allow us to control quality in all aspects of our business while operating at scale. 
 We utilize various extraction techniques including super critical ethanol extraction, carbon dioxide extraction, hydrocarbon extraction, and mechanical separation. We have invested in light hydrocarbon extraction processes, allowing for concentrates that 
 4 

preserve the natural ratios of cannabinoids, terpenes, and other target compounds to better replicate the flower experience. Light hydrocarbon extraction also offers the benefit of greater extraction yields in many cases. In addition, we own CO2 extraction, distillation, purification and manufacturing technology used to produce a line of cannabis topicals and vapes featuring cannabinoids. 
 Marketing and Community Outreach 
 Trulieve s marketing strategies are developed to maximize the unique opportunities of the markets in which we operate. In medical markets, our marketing efforts are centered around education and outreach for physicians and medical patients. Our educational materials are designed to help physicians understand cannabinoid science, the high standards pursuant to which our plants are cultivated, the processes required for regulatory compliance, and how our products provide relief for their patients. Our dedicated physician education team delivers in-person outreach to hundreds of physicians each month as well as immediate phone support through a dedicated physician education team member in our call center. Patients primarily learn about us through their physicians, patient-centric community events, and digital marketing. We participate in outreach and community events on a monthly basis. An engaged audience is captured through our digital content marketing and via multiple popular social media platforms. 
 In adult use markets, our marketing efforts drive awareness of the Trulieve brand as well as our branded product portfolio directly to the end customer. Our marketing towards customers who are more familiar with cannabis products requires different strategies that inspire, tap into relevant cultural moments in their lives, build community as well as educate on our products uniqueness versus our competitors. 
 A core element of our strategy centers around the distribution of branded products through our retail locations and wholesale channels. We strive to set a high standard for excellence and deliver excellent customer experiences in our retail locations. We have developed and acquired a portfolio of our own branded retail products that we cultivate, manufacture and distribute in our regional hubs. Trulieve brands include premium tier brands Avenue, Cultivar Collection, and Muse; mid-tier brands Modern Flower, Alchemy, Momenta, and Sweet Talk, and value tier brands Co2lors, Loveli, and Roll One. The team monitors developments in the fast-paced cannabis industry and adjacent industries to help us remain competitive. 
 We have also developed relationships with brand partners that allow for the sale of partner branded products in select markets and retail locations. Brand partnerships include arrangements with Bellamy Brothers, Bhang, Binske, Black Tuna, Blue River, Connected, DeLisioso, Khalifa Kush, Love s Oven, Miami Mango, Moxie, SLANG, and Sunshine Cannabis. 
 It is our goal to generate brand loyalty by providing customers with industry-leading branded products and superior service in an appealing, approachable setting. We accomplish this goal through several key strategies: training; branded store experiences; brand awareness; multiple channels of distribution; our loyalty program and 360 brand activation that builds community across platforms. 
 Customer experience is an area of significant focus for Trulieve. We employ and continuously improve numerous training programs and methods to provide our front-line workers with the resources and information they need to provide customers with an excellent experience across all Trulieve locations. We offer specialized management training so there is daily reinforcement of customer experience best practices. 
 As part of our customer centric approach, in select markets we offer various purchase options, including phone ordering, online ordering, home delivery, and in store. We understand each consumer has unique communication preferences and capabilities. As such, we engage with customers and physicians through a variety of methods including email, text, social media and online chat. In all markets, we engage with various communities who may benefit, such as veterans, seniors, organizations that serve qualifying populations, and various health and wellness groups. Search engine optimization of our website also captures potential customers researching the benefits of medical cannabis, which offers another pathway to informative materials about therapeutic uses of cannabis, our products and how to legally access them.

Trulieve US is licensed to produce and sell medical cannabis in the State of Florida through the Florida Department of Health, Office of Medical Marijuana Use. The Department issued a license to Trulieve US on November 23, 2015. 
 Competitive Conditions and Position 
 The markets in which we operate are highly competitive markets with relatively high barriers to entry given the licensed nature of the cannabis industry. See Regulatory Overview below for additional information regarding the impact of regulation on our business. Trulieve competes directly with cannabis producers and retailers within single-state operating markets, as well as those that operate across several U.S. markets. 
 The vast majority of both manufacturing and retail competitors in our markets consist of localized or regional businesses with operations in a single state market. Other multi-state cannabis operators compete directly in several of our operating markets. Aside from this direct competition, out-of-state operators that are capitalized well enough to enter those markets through acquisitions are also part of the competitive landscape. Similarly, as we execute on our regional hub strategy and expand across the U.S., operators in our future state markets will inevitably become direct competitors. Increased competition by larger and better financed competitors could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 7 

We face additional competition from new entrants. If the number of consumers of medical and adult use cannabis in our markets increases, the demand for products will increase and we expect that competition will become more intense, as current and future competitors begin to offer an increasing number of diversified products. We expect to continue to invest in several areas, including product development and innovation, marketing and branding, sales and distribution and customer service and retention. Trulieve may not have sufficient resources to maintain investments on a competitive basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 See Item 1A Risk Factors with respect to competition. 
 Key Business Objectives 
 Trulieve will continue to focus on achieving our vision and mission to be a leading customer-focused cannabis brand in the U.S., with depth in select markets with favorable attributes relative to our strategic vision. We aim to provide the highest level of cannabis products and customer experience through authentic and reciprocal relationships. 
 Our strategic priorities include the following: 
 
 Deliver exceptional customer experiences 

Expand distribution of branded product through branded retail 

Focus on cash generation and preservation 

Invest in infrastructure and technology platforms to support future growth 

Trulieve Leases 
 We own or lease our facility locations including cultivation, processing, retail and corporate office locations. We do not have any one lease representing over 10 of our consolidated leasing costs and, as a result, do not consider any of our leases to be material. In Florida, we have 123 operational dispensaries, of which 122 are leased, and we have seven cultivation, manufacturing and distribution facilities, of which one is entirely leased and a portion of one other facility is the subject of a lease. In Arizona, we have 20 operational dispensaries, of which 16 are leased, and we have six cultivation, manufacturing, and distribution facilities, of which 4 are leased. In California, we have three operational dispensaries, of which two are leased. We have a single operational manufacturing facility in Colorado that is leased. We have one operational dispensary in Connecticut that is leased. In Georgia, we own the property for our production facility, and we are in the process of developing medical dispensaries at leased locations. In Massachusetts, we operate three dispensaries, all of which are leased, and one cultivation property which is leased. We have three operational dispensaries in Maryland, of which two are leased, and we also operate a cultivation, manufacturing and distribution facility on adjacent leased properties. In Pennsylvania, there are 19 operational affiliated dispensaries, 17 of which are leased, and there are three affiliated cultivation and manufacturing facilities, of which one is leased. In West Virginia, we have nine dispensaries that are leased and a cultivation facility that we own. 
 Specialized Skills 
 We recruit talented individuals to join the Trulieve team. Our employees have a wide range of skill sets, including employees with PhD and master s degrees. Many of our employees are college graduates and have specific skills related to their job function. We intend to continue to build out our research and development team with scientists and other technical specialists. We use a variety of recruiting techniques, including online resources as well as recruiting professionals, to assist with filling specialized roles. 
 Supply Chain 
 We have varying degrees of vertical operations in the markets in which we operate. In the Florida market, our operations are fully vertically integrated as required by state regulations. In other markets we may operate within one or more segments of the cannabis value chain. In the normal course of our business, we purchase input materials and components that we utilize in the cultivation, processing, manufacture and distribution of our products. No individual supplier represents a significant portion of our purchases or represent a material risk to our operations. 
 Brand Recognition and Intellectual Property 
 We have built brand recognition throughout our markets. One of our key business objectives is to build brand equity in the Trulieve brand name through our branded retail stores and interactions with our customers. We intend to rebrand acquired and affiliated locations over time as part of our plan to expand our branded retail reach. Trulieve maintains a consistent approach to the design of its retail stores and endeavors to create a uniform experience for its customers. 
 8 

We regularly seek to protect our intellectual property rights in connection with our operating names and our brand names. The U.S. trademark statute, The Lanham Act, allows for the protection of trademarks and service marks on products and services used, or intended for use, lawfully. Because cannabis-related products and services remain illegal at the federal level under the Controlled Substances Act, we are not able to fully protect our intellectual property at the federal level; therefore, we currently seek trademark protections at the state level where commercially feasible. Nonetheless, our success depends upon other areas of our business such as product development and design, production and marketing and not exclusively upon trademarks and trade secrets. 
 We have developed proprietary cultivation techniques. We have also developed certain proprietary intellectual property for production best practices, procedures and methods. This requires specialized skills in cultivation, extraction and refining. 
 We rely on non-disclosure/confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. Where commercially feasible, we will proactively seek intellectual property protection for newly developed brands as well as for expansion of existing brands across current markets and into new markets. We own several website domains, numerous social media accounts across all major platforms and various phone and web application platforms. 
 Year-Round Business 
 Our business operates year-round. Operations and sales trends in select markets where we operate do follow seasonal trends with various times of the year providing an opportunity for outdoor cultivation, seasonal impacts on sales in summer and winter months in markets in the Southwest and Northeast and promotional activity increases around specific industry and holiday events. 
 Diversity, Inclusion Equity (DE I) 
 We are committed to contributing positively to diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts within the legal cannabis industry. As a business that produces and distributes a product that many people especially people of color were arrested and incarcerated for in the past, we recognize the significance of promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in the cannabis industry. Over the past year, we have enhanced our DE I efforts with a restructuring of the department and new department leadership to support DE I initiatives with the involvement of executives, senior management, and employees throughout the Company. These programs support our efforts to recruit and develop talent, implement company-wide diversity and cultural competency training, increase supplier diversity, engage in social justice initiatives and more. 
 Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
 As a purpose-driven company, ESG is integral to our growth and corporate achievements. Our commitment to ESG makes us better planners, cultivators, and retailers, supports transparency and strong governance, contributes to improved safety and environmental performance, and strengthens our connection with local communities. We have established governance policies and management systems to codify our responsibilities and help manage risk across the company. We also implemented other measures including environmental safeguards at our cultivation facilities, recycling initiatives, and safety training for security personnel at our dispensaries. 
 REGULATORY OVERVIEW 
 In accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators Staff Notice 51-352 (Revised) dated February 8, 2018 Issuers with U.S. Marijuana-Related Activities Staff Notice 51-352 ), below is a discussion of the federal and state-level United States regulatory bodies in those jurisdictions where the Company is currently directly involved, through its subsidiaries, in the cannabis industry. In accordance with Staff Notice 51-352, the Company will evaluate, monitor and reassess this disclosure, and any related risks, on an ongoing basis and the same will be supplemented and amended to investors in public filings, including in the event of government policy changes or the introduction of new or amended guidance, laws or regulations regarding cannabis regulation. 
 Federal Regulation of Cannabis in the United States 
 The United States federal government regulates drugs in large part through the Controlled Substances Act or CSA. Marijuana, which refers to certain parts and derivatives of the cannabis plant, is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. As a Schedule I controlled substance, the federal Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, considers marijuana to have a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision. According to the U.S. federal government, cannabis and cannabis related products having a concentration of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, of 0.3 or less is cannabis. Cannabis with a THC content 0.3 or less is classified as hemp. The scheduling of cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance is inconsistent with what we believe to be widely accepted medical uses for cannabis by physicians, researchers, customers, and others. Moreover, as of December 31, 2022, and despite the conflict with U.S. federal law, at least 39 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto 
 9 

Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have legalized cannabis for medical use. Twenty-one of those states and the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam have legalized the adult use of cannabis for recreational purposes. 
 Cannabis is largely regulated at the state level in the United States. Although certain states and territories of the United States authorize medical or adult-use cannabis production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, under United States federal law, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of cannabis and any related drug paraphernalia is illegal federal law permits the distribution and sale of paraphernalia if authorized by local or State law). Although our activities are compliant with the applicable state and local laws in those states where we maintain such licenses, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve us of liability under United States federal law nor provide a defense to any federal criminal action that may be brought against us. 
 In 2013, as more and more states began to legalize medical and/or adult-use cannabis, the federal government attempted to provide clarity on the incongruity between federal law and these state-legal regulatory frameworks. Until 2018, the federal government provided guidance to federal agencies and banking institutions through a series of DOJ memoranda. The most notable of this guidance came in the form of a memorandum issued by former U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013, which we refer to as the Cole Memorandum. 
 The Cole Memorandum offered guidance to federal agencies on how to prioritize civil enforcement, criminal investigations, and prosecutions regarding marijuana in all states and quickly set a standard with which marijuana-related businesses would comply. The Cole Memorandum put forth eight prosecution priorities: 
 
 1. Preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors; 
 2. Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels; 
 3. Preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states; 
 4. Preventing the state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; 
 5. Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana; 
 6. Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use; 
 7. Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands; and 
 8. Preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property. 
 On January 4, 2018, former United States Attorney General Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum by issuing a new memorandum to all United States Attorneys, which we refer to as the Sessions Memo. Rather than establishing national enforcement priorities particular to marijuana-related crimes in jurisdictions where certain marijuana activity was legal under state law, the Sessions Memo simply rescinded the Cole Memorandum and other Department of Justice memoranda providing prosecutorial guidance on state and tribally authorized medical and adult-use cannabis activities and instructed that [i]n deciding which marijuana activities to prosecute... with the [DOJ s] finite resources, prosecutors should follow the well- established principles that govern all federal prosecutions. Namely, these include the seriousness of the offense, history of criminal activity, deterrent effect of prosecution, the interests of victims, and other principles. 
 On January 21, 2021, Joseph R. Biden, Jr. was sworn in as President of the United States. President Biden s Attorney General, Merrick Garland, was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 10, 2021. It is not yet known whether the Department of Justice, under President Biden and Attorney General Garland, will re-adopt the Cole Memorandum or announce a substantive marijuana enforcement policy. During his Senate confirmation, Merrick Garland told Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ), It does not seem to me useful the use of limited resources that we have to be pursuing prosecutions in states that have legalized and are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise. Such statements are not official declarations or policies of the DOJ and are not binding on the DOJ, any United States Attorney, or the United States federal courts. Substantial uncertainty regarding United States federal enforcement remains. To date, there have been no new federal cannabis memorandums issued by the DOJ or any published change in federal enforcement policy. However, in October of 2022, the Biden Administration announced its intention to review the regulation of marijuana under the CSA by directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General to initiate the administrative process to expeditiously review marijuana s Schedule I status. This historic directive could result in the decriminalization of marijuana for medical and adult-use by descheduling or rescheduling marijuana. Concurrently, President Biden 
 10 

also announced a pardon of all prior federal simple possession of marijuana offenses and urged governors to do the same at the state level. 
 Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of marijuana will not be repealed or overturned or that local government authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Unless and until the United States Congress amends the CSA with respect to marijuana (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments, there can be no assurance), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law. Currently, in the absence of uniform federal guidance, as had been established by the Cole Memorandum, enforcement priorities are determined by respective United States Attorneys. 
 As an industry best practice, despite the rescission of the Cole Memorandum, we abide by the following standard operating policies and procedures, which are designed to ensure compliance with the guidance provided by the Cole Memorandum: 
 
 1. Continuously monitor our operations for compliance with all licensing requirements as established by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough, and other political/administrative divisions; 
 
 2. Ensure that our cannabis-related activities adhere to the scope of the licensing obtained (for example: in the states where cannabis is permitted only for adult-use, the products are only sold to individuals who meet the requisite age requirements); 
 
 3. Implement policies and procedures to prevent the distribution of our cannabis products to minors; 
 
 4. Implement policies and procedures in place to avoid the distribution of the proceeds from our operations to criminal enterprises, gangs, or cartels; 
 
 5. Implement an inventory tracking system and necessary procedures to reliably track inventory and prevent the diversion of cannabis or cannabis products into those states where cannabis is not permitted by state law or across any state lines in general; 
 
 6. Monitor the operations at our facilities so that our state-authorized cannabis business activity is not used as a cover or pretense for trafficking of other illegal drugs or engaging in any other illegal activity; and 
 
 7. Implement quality controls so that our products comply with applicable regulations and contain necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products to avoid adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and discourage impaired driving. 
 
 In addition, we frequently conduct background checks to confirm that the principals and management of our operating subsidiaries are of good character and have not been involved with illegal drugs, engaged in illegal activity or activities involving violence, or the use of firearms in the cultivation, manufacturing, or distribution of cannabis. We also conduct ongoing reviews of the activities of our cannabis businesses, the premises on which they operate, and the policies and procedures related to the possession of cannabis or cannabis products outside of the licensed premises. 
 Moreover, in recent years, certain temporary federal legislative enactments that protect the medical marijuana and hemp industries have also been in effect. For instance, certain marijuana businesses receive a measure of protection from federal prosecution by operation of temporary appropriations measures that have been enacted into law as amendments (or riders to federal spending bills passed by Congress and signed by Presidents Obama, Trump, and, most recently, President Biden. For instance, in the Appropriations Act of 2015, Congress included a budget rider that prohibits DOJ from expending any funds to enforce any law that interferes with a state s implementation of its own medical marijuana laws. The rider originally known as the Rohrbacher-Farr Amendment after its original lead sponsors is now known as the Joyce Amendment after its current sponsor. Originally, a Republican-controlled House and Democratic-controlled Senate passed the Rohrbacher-Farr Amendment. The bill was a bipartisan appropriations measure that looks to prohibit the DEA from spending funds to arrest state-licensed medical marijuana patients and providers. Subsequently, the rider has been included in multiple budgets passed by successive Congresses controlled by both major political parties. Most recently, on December 29, 2022, the Amendment was renewed through the signing of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 which extended the protections for the medical marijuana industry until September 30, 2023. While the Amendment has been included in successive appropriations legislation or resolutions since 2015, its inclusion or non-inclusion is subject to political change. 
 Notably, the Joyce Amendment has applied only to medical marijuana programs and has not provided the same protections to enforcement against adult-use activities. If the Amendment is no longer in effect, the risk of federal enforcement and override of state marijuana laws would increase.

United States Border Entry 
 The United States Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, enforces the laws of the United States as they pertain to lawful travel and trade into and out of the U.S. Crossing the border while in violation of the CSA and other related United States federal laws may result in denied admission, seizures, fines, and apprehension. CBP officers administer and determine the admissibility of travelers who are non-U.S. citizens into the United States pursuant to the United States Immigration and Nationality Act. An investment in our Subordinate Voting Shares, if it became known to CBP, could have an impact on a non-U.S. citizen s admissibility into the United States and could lead to a lifetime ban on admission. 
 Because marijuana remains illegal under United States federal law, those investing in Canadian companies with operations in the United States cannabis industry could face detention, denial of entry, or lifetime bans from the United States for their business associations with United States marijuana businesses. Entry happens at the sole discretion of CBP officers on duty, and these officers have wide latitude to ask questions to determine the admissibility of a non-US citizen or foreign national. The government of Canada has started warning travelers that previous use of marijuana, or any substance prohibited by United States federal laws, could mean denial of entry to the United States. Business or financial involvement in the marijuana industry in the United States could also be reason enough for CBP to deny entry. On September 21, 2018, CBP released a statement outlining its current position with respect to enforcement of the laws of the United States. It stated that Canada s legalization of cannabis will not change CBP enforcement of United States laws regarding controlled substances and because marijuana continues to be a controlled substance under United States law, working in or facilitating the proliferation of the legal marijuana industry in U.S. states where it is deemed legal may affect admissibility to the United States. As a result, CBP has affirmed that employees, directors, officers, managers, and investors of companies involved in business activities related to marijuana in the United States (such as Trulieve), who are not United States citizens, face the risk of being barred from entry into the United States. 
 Anti-Money Laundering Laws and Access to Banking 
 The Company is subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States that involve anti-money laundering, financial recordkeeping, and the proceeds of crime, including the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (referred to herein as the Bank Secrecy Act ), as amended by Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act), and any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines, issued, administered or enforced by governmental authorities in the United States. 
 Additionally, under United States federal law, it may potentially be a violation of federal anti-money laundering statutes for financial institutions to take any proceeds from the sale of any Schedule I controlled substance or otherwise introduce them into the United States banking system. For example, banks and other financial institutions could potentially be prosecuted and convicted of aiding and abetting money laundering under the Bank Secrecy Act for providing services to cannabis businesses. Therefore, under the Bank Secrecy Act, banks or other financial institutions that provide a cannabis business with depository services, small business loans, or any other financial service could be charged with money laundering or conspiracy. 
 While there has been no change in U.S. federal banking laws to accommodate businesses in the large and increasing number of U.S. states that have legalized medical or adult-use marijuana, the U.S. Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network FinCEN issued guidance in 2014 and was not rescinded by the Sessions Memo. The FinCEN Guidance provides guidance to financial institutions on how to engage with state and tribally authorized cannabis entities in accordance with federal law. An additional Department of Justice memorandum, issued in parallel with the FinCEN Guidance and since rescinded as part of the Sessions Memo, provided guidance to prosecutors regarding money laundering and other financial crimes as it pertained to cannabis entities and financial institutions operating in accordance with the FinCEN Guidance. The FinCEN Guidance and now rescinded accompanying Department of Justice memorandum is often publicly interpreted as suggesting a way for financial institutions to provide depository services to cannabis-related entities so long as that cannabis-related business activities are legal in their state or territory and none of the federal enforcement priorities referenced in the Cole Memorandum are violated (such as keeping marijuana out of the hands of organized crime). Importantly, the FinCEN Guidance also clarifies how financial institutions can provide depository services to marijuana-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act obligations, including enhanced customer due diligence, but makes it clear that they are doing so at their own risk. The customer due diligence steps typically include: 
 
 1. Verifying with the appropriate state authorities whether the business is duly licensed and registered; 
 
 2. Reviewing the license application (and related documentation) submitted by the business for obtaining a state license to operate its marijuana-related business; 
 
 3. Requesting available information about the business and related parties from state licensing and enforcement authorities; 
 
 12 

4. Developing an understanding of the normal and expected activity for the business, including the types of products to be sold and the type of customers to be served (e.g., medical versus adult-use customers); 
 
 5. Ongoing monitoring of publicly available sources for adverse information about the business and related parties; 
 
 6. Ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity, including for any of the red flags described in the FinCEN Guidance; and 
 
 7. Refreshing information obtained as part of customer due diligence on a periodic basis and commensurate with the risk. 
 With respect to information regarding state licensure obtained in connection with such customer due diligence, a financial institution may reasonably rely on the accuracy of information provided by state licensing authorities, where states make such information available. 
 While the FinCEN Guidance decreased some risk for financial institutions considering servicing the cannabis industry, in practice, challenges remain with financial institutions willingness to provide services to marijuana-related businesses. This is because current U.S. federal law does not guarantee financial institutions immunity from prosecution. It also requires other financial institutions to undertake time-consuming and costly due diligence (i.e., enhanced due diligence) on each marijuana-related business they accept as a customer. 
 Those commercial banks and/or credit unions that have agreed to work with marijuana businesses are typically limiting those accounts to small percentages of their total deposits to avoid creating liquidity and concentration risk. Since, theoretically, the federal government could change its policy on cannabis-related businesses at any time and without notice, these banks and credit unions must keep sufficient cash on hand to be able to return the full value of all deposits from marijuana-related businesses in a single day, while also keeping sufficient liquid capital on hand to service their other customers. Because many banks and credit unions that are providing banking services to marijuana-related businesses are smaller institutions, applicable concentration limits may also impose limits on the aggregate amounts of loans that might be provided to the industry. Those commercial banks and credit unions that do have customers in the marijuana industry can charge marijuana businesses high fees to cover the added cost of ensuring compliance with the FinCEN Guidance. 
 As mentioned previously, unlike the Cole Memorandum, the FinCEN Guidance has not been rescinded. FinCEN has stated that it views the FinCEN Guidance to include compliance with the requirements of the rescinded Cole Memorandum. Secretary of the Treasury, Janet Yellen, has not made any public statements with regards to how the Treasury Department plans to treat marijuana-related businesses. 
 Although a cornerstone of marijuana banking, the FinCEN Guidance is solely a memorandum and the encapsulation of the federal government's current policy toward marijuana banking it is not law and does not change established U.S. federal law. 
 As an industry best practice and consistent with its standard operating procedures, Trulieve adheres to all customer due diligence steps in the FinCEN Guidance and any additional requirements imposed by those financial institutions it utilizes. However, in the event that any of our operations, or any proceeds thereof, any dividends or distributions therefrom, or any profits or revenues accruing from such operations in the United States were found to be in violation of anti-money laundering legislation or otherwise, such transactions could be viewed as proceeds of crime under one or more of the statutes noted above or any other applicable legislation. This could restrict or otherwise jeopardize our ability to declare or pay dividends or affect other distributions. 
 In the United States, the SAFE Banking Act was adopted by the U.S. House of Representatives, which would grant banks and other financial institutions immunity from federal criminal prosecution for servicing marijuana-related businesses if the underlying marijuana business follows state law. It is unclear whether the U.S. Senate will take up the SAFE Banking Act for a vote. While there is strong support in the public and within Congress for the SAFE Banking Act and similar legislation, there can be no assurance that it will be passed as presently proposed or at all. In both Canada and the United States, transactions involving banks and other financial institutions are both difficult and unpredictable under the current legal and regulatory landscape. Legislative changes could help to reduce or eliminate these challenges for companies in the cannabis space and would improve the efficiency of both significant and minor financial transactions. 
 Ability to Access Public and Private Capital 
 Given the current laws regarding cannabis at the federal level in the United States, traditional bank financing is typically not available to United States marijuana companies (although there has been a recent increase in the availability of traditional loans from alternative lending providers). Specifically, since financial transactions involving proceeds generated by cannabis-related conduct can form the basis for prosecution under anti-money laundering statutes, the unlicensed money transmitter statute, and the Bank Secrecy Act, businesses involved in the cannabis industry often have difficulty finding a bank willing to accept their business. Banks 
 13 

that do accept deposits from cannabis-related businesses in the United States must do so in compliance with the FinCEN Guidance. We have banking relationships in the states where we operate with state-chartered banks for deposits and payroll; however, we have limited access to traditional bank financing. 
 Private financing for the marijuana industry can be difficult to access due to the federal illegality of marijuana and often includes substantial costs and fees. 
 Tax Concerns 
 An additional challenge for cannabis-related businesses is that the provisions of IRC Section 280E are applied by the IRS to businesses operating in the medical and adult-use cannabis industry. IRC Section 280E prohibits cannabis businesses from deducting their ordinary and necessary business expenses, forcing them to pay higher effective federal tax rates than similar companies in other industries. The effective tax rate on a cannabis business depends on how large its ratio of non-deductible expenses is to its total revenues. Therefore, businesses in the legal cannabis industry may be less profitable than they would otherwise be. Furthermore, although the IRS issued a clarification allowing the deduction of the cost of goods sold, the scope of such items is interpreted very narrowly, and the bulk of operating costs and general administrative costs are not permitted to be deducted. 
 The 2018 Farm Bill 
 CBD is a nonintoxicating cannabinoid found in cannabis and is often derived from hemp, which contains, at most, only trace amounts of THC. On December 20, 2018, Former President Trump signed the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (popularly known as the 2018 Farm Bill) into law. Until the 2018 Farm Bill became law, hemp fell within the definition of marijuana under the CSA, and the DEA classified hemp as a Schedule I controlled substance because hemp is part of the cannabis plant. 
 The 2018 Farm Bill defines hemp as the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of the plant with a delta-9 THC concentration of not more than 0.3 by dry weight and removes hemp from the CSA. The 2018 Farm Bill requires the United States Department of Agriculture, or USDA, to, among other things: (1) evaluate and approve regulatory plans approved by individual states for the cultivation and production of industrial hemp, and (2) promulgate regulations and guidelines to establish and administer a program for the cultivation and production of hemp in the U.S. On January 15, 2021, the USDA published its final rule for hemp production (referred to herein as the USDA Rule ). The USDA Rule, effective March 22, 2021, among other things, sets minimum standards for the cultivation and production of hemp, as well as requirements for laboratory testing of hemp. The hemp production regulations promulgated by the USDA are in lieu of those states not adopting state-specific hemp regulations; however, state programs must meet certain requirements contained in the USDA Rule. Hemp and products derived from it, such as CBD, may be sold into commerce and transported across state lines provided that the hemp from which any product is derived was cultivated under a license issued by an authorized state or tribal program approved by the USDA or under a USDA hemp production license, meets the definition of hemp, and the products are compliant with other applicable federal laws including the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The 2018 Farm Bill is set to expire in September 2023 and a new farm bill is expected by December 2023. It remains to be seen how hemp regulation may change under the 2023 Farm Bill. 
 The 2018 Farm Bill explicitly preserved the authority of the FDA to regulate hemp-derived products under the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The FDA currently takes the position that CBD and THC may not be added to food or marketed as a dietary supplement. The FDA has not yet promulgated its own rules for the regulation of hemp-derived products. An announcement from the FDA regarding the regulation of hemp products is expected sometime in early 2023 and U.S legislators have been calling for an investigation into the FDA s inaction in this area. 
 Compliance with Applicable State Law in the United States 
 The Company is classified as having direct involvement in the United States cannabis industry, and we believe that we are in compliance with applicable state laws, as well as related licensing requirements and the regulatory frameworks enacted in the states we operate in. We are not subject to any citations or notices of violation with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory frameworks which may have an impact on our licenses, business activities, or operations. We use reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that our business remains compliant with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory frameworks enacted by Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and Georgia, through the advice of our Director of Compliance, who monitors and reviews our business practices and changes to applicable state laws and regulations, as well as United States Federal enforcement priorities. Our Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel work with external legal advisors in in the states in which we operate to ensure that we are in ongoing compliance with applicable state laws. 
 In the United States, cannabis is regulated at the state level pursuant to state regulatory bodies consistent with federal enforcement priorities. Although each state in which we operate (and anticipate operating) authorizes, as applicable, medical and/or adult-use marijuana production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, and numerous other states have legalized marijuana in some 
 14 

form, under U.S. federal law, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of marijuana and any related drug paraphernalia remains illegal, and any such acts are criminal acts under U.S. federal law. Although we believe that our business activities are compliant with applicable state and local laws of the United States, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to marijuana may neither absolve us of liability under U.S. federal law nor provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against us. Any such proceedings brought against us may result in a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Regulation of the Medical and Adult-Use Marijuana Markets in Arizona 
 Arizona voters passed the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act (the AMMA ), A.R.S. Section 36-2801 et seq. in December 2010, Arizona Proposition 207 (codified in A.R.S. Section 36-2850 et seq.), also known as the Smart and Safe Arizona Act (the SSAA ), approved by voters on November 3, 2020, legalized the adult recreational use of marijuana. Adult-use marijuana is subject to state and local sales taxes, including a 5.6 state transaction privilege tax, plus city, county, and district taxes (which vary based on location of facility), and 16 excise tax on marijuana and marijuana products. Following the passage of Proposition 207, existing medical operators were permitted to apply for licensure to permit sales to adult -use consumers. Adult-use sales commenced in Arizona on January 22, 2021. 
 The AMMA and SSAA designate the Arizona Department of Health Services (the ADHS as the licensing and issuing authority for the Arizona Medical and Adult-Use Programs (collectively, the AZ Marijuana Programs ). The ADHS rules and regulations for implementing the AZ Marijuana Programs are set forth in the Arizona Administrative Code Title 9, Chapter 17 and Arizona Administrative Code Title 9, Chapter 18. The first medical marijuana licenses in Arizona were issued in 2012, but as of January 2021, every one of those medical licenses converted to a dual license. 
 
 Arizona Licenses and Regulations 
 Arizona medical and adult-use licenses are valid for two years. At least 30 days before the expiration date of the license, licensees are required to submit a renewal application that the requisite renewal application fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted within the timeframe required, and there are no material violations noted against the applicable licenses, we would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business. While our compliance controls have been developed to mitigate the risk of any material violations of a license arising, there is no assurance that our licenses will be renewed in the future in a timely manner. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the licensing renewal process could impede our ongoing or planned operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects. 
 Arizona is a vertically integrated system so that each license permits the holder to acquire, cultivate, process, manufacture, transfer, supply, and/or dispense medical and/or adult-use marijuana in compliance with the AMMA and ADHS rules and regulations. 
 
 Arizona Dispensing Requirements 
 The AZ Marijuana Programs do not designate marijuana or marijuana products as medical or adult-use until the point-of-sale. As such, any licensed facility can transfer and sell marijuana and marijuana products to both licensed medical and adult-use operators. Each facility maintained under a dual license has received an approval to operate under the AMMA or SSAA. The retail facility for dual licensees is subject to both the AMMA and SSAA, but is generally inspected by the ADHS under the SSAA. However, a dual licensees' other facilities (i.e., cultivation/manufacturing) are licensed under the medical program unless the dual licensee applied to ADHS to operate under only the SSAA. 
 
 AMMA 
 In order to dispense medical cannabis to a qualifying patient or designated caregiver, a licensed dispensary is required to (1) verify the qualifying patient s or designated caregiver s identity, (2) offer appropriate patient education or support materials, (3) make available testing results related to the product sought, if requested by the qualifying patient or designated caregiver, (4) enter the qualifying patient s or designated caregiver s registry identification number on the identification card presented into the medical marijuana electronic verification system, (5) verify the validity of the identification card presented, (6) verify that the amount of marijuana product to be dispensed would not cause the qualifying patient to exceed the regulatory limit, and (7) enter information into the medical cannabis electronic verification system regarding the amount of medical cannabis dispensed, whether it was dispensed directly to the qualifying customer or to a caregiver, the date and time of dispensing, the registry identification number of the facility agent, and the licensee's registry identification number. 
 For medical card holders, qualifying conditions include Alzheimer s disease, cachexia, cancer, chronic pain, Crohn s disease, glaucoma, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus HIV or acquired immune deficiency syndrome AIDS ), muscle spasms, nausea, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD ), sclerosis, and seizures. 
 15 

All product categories are allowed to be sold as either adult-use or medical, except edibles for adult-use consumers, which cannot be more than 10mg per serving or 100mg per package. 
 
 SSAA 
 In order to dispense adult-use marijuana to consumers, a licensed retail facility is required to (1) verify that the consumer is 21 years of age or older, (2) make available the results of testing of the marijuana or marijuana product, if requested by the consumer, and (3) ensure that the amount of marijuana or marijuana product to be sold to the consumer does not exceed one ounce of marijuana, with not more than five grams being in the form of a marijuana concentrate. 
 
 Arizona Requirements Relating to Recordkeeping and Inventory Control 
 Licensed operators are required by regulation to utilize an inventory control system that documents (1) daily updated inventory amounts of marijuana and marijuana products, (2) acquisitions of marijuana from the licensee's own facilities, other licensed operators, qualifying patients or designated caregivers (under the AMMA only), (3) information related to batches of marijuana cultivated by the licensee, (4) information regarding provision of medical marijuana to other dispensaries, (5) information relating to required testing of marijuana products, and (6) the disposition of marijuana products determined not to be dispensed to a customer or to be included in manufacturing a marijuana product. Licensed dispensaries are additionally required to keep records regarding qualifying customers/patients that: (1) include dated entries from registered dispensary agents regarding dispensing, (2) are safeguarded against unauthorized access and tampering, (3) include documentation of requests by qualifying customers and caregivers regarding marijuana products and educational materials. 
 
 Arizona Requirements Relating to Security and Transportation 
 Licensed operators are permitted to transport cannabis and cannabis products between the licensee's own licensed facilities, including retail facilities and cultivation/manufacturing sites, qualifying licensed third-party operators, and licensed analytical laboratories. Licensed operators are required to complete a comprehensive trip plan prior to transport that describes the products being transported, the time of the trip, the anticipated route, and the Facility Agents transporting and receiving the marijuana or marijuana products. During transportation, facility agents are required to (among other things) use unmarked vehicles, hide cannabis and cannabis products from view, and communicate with the licensed operator. Licensed operators are required to keep records of trip plans for ADHS inspection. 
 Licensed operators are also required to implement a variety of security measures to protect retail and cultivation/manufacturing sites from unauthorized access, including: (1) intrusion detection devices, (2) exterior lighting, (3) video cameras covering the entrances and exits of limited access areas and facilities, as well as point of sale locations and grow rooms, (4) failure notification systems, (5) battery backup for cameras and other equipment, and (6) panic buttons on the interior of facilities. Licensed operators are also required to implement policies and procedures that: (1) restrict access to the areas of the licensed facility that contain marijuana, (2) provide for identification of authorized individuals, (3) prevent loitering, (4) outline the conduct of electronic monitoring, and (5) outline the use of panic buttons. 
 
 Arizona Reporting Requirements 
 For medical sales, the State of Arizona uses the ADHS Medical Marijuana Verification System ADHS MMV to validate card holders, verify allotment amounts and track all retail transactions for Arizona qualified customers. The ADHS MMV system is also used annually by license holders to renew a medical-only dispensary registration certificate, if applicable. 
 While ADHS requires the internal tracking of marijuana and marijuana products, the SSAA does not require licensees to procure, develop, acquire and maintain a system to track marijuana and marijuana products at all points of cultivation, manufacturing, and sale until December 31, 2023, at the latest. 
 We use Leaf Logix software as our computerized, seed-to-sale tracking and inventory system. Individual licensees whether directly or through third- party integration systems are required to capture and retain all information pertaining to the acquisition, possession, cultivation, manufacturing, delivery, transfer, transportation, supplying, selling, distributing, or dispensing of medical marijuana, to meet all reporting requirements for the State of Arizona. 
 
 ADHS Inspections 
 The ADHS oversees licensing for medical marijuana and adult-use marijuana. The Arizona market is divided into four classes of licenses: (1) medical-only licenses, (2) adult-use only social equity licenses, (3) dual licenses, and (4) small county back-fill licenses. Each license grants the licensee the ability to have one retail facility, one cultivation site attached to the retail facility, one 
 16 

processing site, and one cultivation site (dual licensees are permitted only one retail site). License holders must operate a retail facility but are not required to establish other vertically integrated operations. As such, processing and cultivation sites can be leased to third-party operators. Arizona, however, does not recognize third-party operators and the license holder is responsible for compliance. As such, a third-party operator and its employees are agents of the licensed operator, notwithstanding agreements to the contrary. 
 See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses associated with the Company's operations in Arizona. 
 Regulation of the Cannabis Market in California 
 In 1996, California voters passed Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996. This provided an affirmative defense for defendants charged with the use, possession, and cultivation of medical cannabis by customers with a physician recommendation for treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or any other illness for which cannabis provides relief. 
 In September 2015, the California legislature passed three bills collectively known as the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act MMRSA ). The MMRSA established a licensing and regulatory framework for medical marijuana businesses in California. In November 2016, voters in California passed Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act AUMA ), creating an adult-use cannabis program for consumers 21 years of age or older. AUMA created a licensing system for commercial marijuana businesses. On June 2017, Governor Brown signed SB-94 into law. SB-94 combined elements of MMRSA and AUMA into one state licensing structure for both medical and adult-use under the Medicinal and Adult-Use of Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act MAUCRSA ). 
 Pursuant to MAUCRSA, three licensing agencies were initially established for the purpose of regulating and licensing California cannabis operators (collectively, the Licensing Agencies ): the Bureau of Cannabis Control BCC ), California Department of Food and Agriculture CDFA ), and the California Department of Public Health CDPH ). In July of 2021, Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 141 AB 141 which consolidated the three former state cannabis authorities into a single, new department now known as the Department of Cannabis Control (the Department ). The Department oversees and regulates all commercial cannabis activities. Operators must apply to the Department for their licenses. On or about September 15, 2021, the Department filed emergency regulations to consolidate, clarify, and make consistent marijuana regulations to the California Office of Administrative Law. These regulations created consistent standards for marijuana licensees across all license types by aligning application requirements, unifying terminology, and clarifying ownership and financial interest requirements. The emergency regulations remained in place while the Department conducted a full rulemaking process to adopt final regulations. The final regulations have been in effect since November 7, 2022. 
 One of the central features of MAUCRSA is known as local control. In order to legally operate a medical or adult-use marijuana business in California, an operator must have both a local and state license. This requires license-holders to operate in cities or counties with marijuana licensing programs. Cities and counties in California are also allowed to limit the number of licenses issued locally or even ban all marijuana licenses completely. 
 Once an operator obtains local approval, the operator must obtain state licenses before conducting any commercial marijuana activity. There are multiple license categories that cover all commercial activity. Categories include: (1) cultivation/nurseries/processors, (2) testing laboratories, (3) distributors/transporters, (4) retailers (including delivery), (5) microbusinesses, (6) event organizers, and (7) manufacturers. Categories of licenses are further broken down into subtypes. For example, there are multiple types of cultivation licenses available depending upon the size of the cultivation operation and whether the operation is indoors/outdoors or uses mixed lighting. Different manufacturing licenses are available depending upon whether volatile or nonvolatile solvents are used. Retail licenses are available depending upon whether the retailer operates from a storefront or a non-storefront. 
 The Cannabis Supply Chain in California 
 In California, local law may determine whether plants must be cultivated outdoors, using mixed-light methods, or fully indoors. Cultivators must also obtain seeds, clones, teens, or other immature plants from licensed nurseries through the traceability system. 
 The cultivation, processing, and movement of cannabis within the state are tracked by the California Cannabis Track and Trace System s METRC software. All licensees are required to input their track and trace data (either manually or using another software that automatically uploads to METRC). Immature plants must be assigned a Unique Identifier number UID which then remains associated with that specific plant s flowers and biomass as it moves through the supply chain to the consumer. Each licensee in the supply chain is required to meticulously log any processing, packaging, and sales associated with that UID. 
 17 

When cannabis plants mature and complete their life cycle, they are harvested, cured, and trimmed in preparation for being sold to processors, distributors, or manufacturers. Cultivators have two main products: flowers, or buds, and the biomass, or trim, which is typically removed from the mature flowers. Trim is commonly sold to manufacturers for further processing into cannabis extracts. Buds may also be sold to manufacturers or distributors for sale to retailers. The cultivator may package and label its cannabis flowers directly or sell flowers in bulk, allowing distributors to package and label the flower. 
 Manufactured marijuana goods sold or transferred to a distributor for final retail sale must be in final packaging. Distributors may not repackage manufactured marijuana goods. The California State cultivation tax initially imposed on marijuana that enters the commercial market ended as of July 1, 2022. 
 California restricts the transportation of marijuana to licensed distributors. Some cultivators and manufacturers maintain their own distribution licenses in order to handle transportation directly, while others contract with third-party licensed distributors for transportation services. Distributors may or may not take possession of the marijuana and marijuana products, and like alcohol distribution, some retailers limit sales to a particular distributor s brand portfolio. Brands may market products to retailers directly or only to distributors. 
 Distributors are the point in the supply chain where final quality assurance testing is performed on products before they go to a retailer. Retailers may not accept or sell products without an accompanying and compliant Certificate of Analysis COA ). Distributors must clearly segregate the product awaiting testing from the product that has already passed testing at their licensed premises until an employee of a licensed testing laboratory comes to their premises and obtains samples from any and all goods proposed to be sold at retail. Cannabis and cannabis products are issued either a pass or fail by the testing laboratory. Under some circumstances, the Department s regulations allow for failing product to be remediated or to be re-labeled to more accurately reflect the COA results. 
 
 California Dispensing Requirements 
 California requires specific warnings, images, and information regarding package contents to be printed on all cannabis packaging. The Department s regulations also require packaging to be both tamper-evident and child-resistant. Distributors and retailers are independently responsible for confirming that products are properly labeled and packaged prior to the consumer sale. 
 Consumers aged 21 and up may purchase cannabis in California from a dispensary with an adult-use license. Some localities still only allow medicinal dispensaries. Consumers aged 18 and up with a valid physician s recommendation may purchase cannabis from a medicinal-only dispensary or an adult-use dispensary. Consumers without valid physician s recommendations may not purchase cannabis from a medicinal-only dispensary. All cannabis businesses are prohibited from hiring employees under the age of 21. 
 
 California Security Requirements 
 In California, local law may determine whether plants must be cultivated outdoors, using mixed-light methods, or fully indoors. Cultivators must also obtain seeds, clones, teens, or other immature plants from licensed nurseries through the traceability system. 
 The cultivation, processing, and movement of cannabis within the state are tracked by METRC. All licensees are required to input their track and trace data (either manually or using another software that automatically uploads to METRC).

The cultivator may package and label its cannabis flowers directly or sell flowers in bulk, allowing distributors to package and label the flower. 
 Manufactured cannabis goods solod or transferred to a distributor for final retail sale by a manufacturer must be in final packaging. Distributors may not repackage. 
 
 California Inspections 
 All licensees are subject to random inspections of their premises by the Department. If an inspection identifies any noncompliance of a licensee, the Department may issue notices to correct, or notices of violation, fines, or take other disciplinary action that may include cancellation of a license.

 Regulation of the Medical and Adult-Use Market in Colorado 
 In 2000, Colorado voters passed Amendment 20, an amendment to the state constitution decriminalizing certain amounts of cannabis for medicinal purposes. The amendment created a regulatory system for granting patient registry cards authorizing individuals with debilitating medical conditions to have and use up to two ounces of a usable form of cannabis and no more than six cannabis plants. The amendment also created a regulatory system for granting patient registry cards authorizing individuals with debilitating medical conditions to have and use limited quantities of cannabis, and an affirmative defense under Colorado criminal law for any cardholder or their primary caregiver to charges of violating state drugs laws. In 2010, the Colorado legislature passed H.B. 10-1284, which enacted the Colorado Medical Marijuana Code, a framework regulating the growth, sale, and distribution of cannabis by licensed dispensaries, administered by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. 
 In 2012, Colorado voted passed Amendment 64, legalizing the recreational use of cannabis in Colorado. Among other provisions, the amendment legalized the cultivation, manufacturing, processing, and sale of cannabis to adults 21 years of age or older. Amendment 64 also directed the Colorado Department of Revenue DOR to establish a comprehensive framework of regulation and enforcement governing licensed cannabis businesses. The Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division MED is the licensing and regulatory agency overseeing all recreational and medical cannabis businesses in Colorado. In 2019, legislators passed statutes updating, among other things, the state s cannabis laws to allow for new sources of investment in the Colorado cannabis industry, including by publicly traded companies and created accompanying disclosure requirements. 
 In Colorado, marijuana businesses must comply with local licensing requirements in addition to state licensing requirements in order to operate. Colorado localities are allowed to limit or prohibit the operation of cannabis cultivation facilities, product manufacturing facilities or retail dispensary facilities. 
 There are multiple license categories that cover all commercial activity. Categories include: (1) medical/retail cultivation, (2) medical/retail stores, (3) medical/retail manufacturers, (4) medical/retail transporters, (5) retail hospitality and sales, (6) medical/retail cannabis business operator and (6) medical/retail testing facilities. Categories of licenses are further broken down into subtypes. For example, there are multiple types of cultivation licenses available depending upon the size of the cultivation operation. Licensees may also apply for permits that allow for the conduct of additional business functions such as centralized distribution, delivery, and off-premises storage. 
 Each facility is authorized to engage only in the type of activity for which it is licensed. Licenses are valid for one year from the date of issuance. Before expiration, licensees are required to submit a renewal application. 
 To acquire a license, the individuals and entities who own or control the licensee must be vetted by the State to determine whether they are suitable under Colorado law to operate a license. Generally, any natural person or entity that holds an equity or voting interest 10 or greater (directly or indirectly) in the licensee must be disclosed and vetted for suitability. All board members and corporate officers of the licensee must be disclosed and vetted, including board members and corporate officers of the entity-owners with 10 or greater interest. Additionally, those who exercise an inordinate amount of control over a licensee whether through financing, IP agreements, management agreements, or some combination thereof, can also be considered controlling beneficial owners by the MED and subsequently be required to undergo vetting for suitability. Colorado licensing requirements largely do not respect anonymity in ownership regularly pierce corporate veils to determine the natural people who ultimately control a given license. 
 Local authorities also grant licenses to conduct cannabis businesses within their jurisdiction, and DOR licensing for a cannabis business is conditioned on approval from the local authorities. An applicant is prohibited from operating a cannabis business prior to obtaining all necessary licenses, registrations, permits, or approvals from both the State licensing authority and local licensing authorities. 
 
 Colorado Security Requirements 
 Colorado law requires that all licensees have a security alarm system and must ensure that their premises are continuously monitored. Licenses must also use commercial-grade non-residential door locks at all points of ingress and egress. All licensed cannabis businesses are required to utilize video surveillance and camera recording systems, which at a minimum, must consist of digital or network video recorders, video monitors, digital archiving devices, and a color printer capable of delivering still photos. Such equipment must be stored in a secure area that is only accessible to the licensee s management staff. In addition to other 
 19 

requirements, all video surveillance equipment must be equipped with a failure notification system that provides prompt notification to the licensee of any prolonged surveillance interruption and/or complete failure of the surveillance system. 
 
 Colorado Inspections 
 The MED and local licensing authorities may conduct announced or unannounced inspections of licensees to determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Licensees may also be subject to inspection of the licensed premises by the local fire department, building inspector, or code enforcement officer to confirm that no health or safety concerns are present. 
 
 Colorado Reporting Requirements 
 Colorado uses METRC as the MED s marijuana inventory tracking system for all medical and adult use licensees. Marijuana is required to be tracked and reported with specific data points from seed to sale through METRC for compliance purposes under Colorado marijuana laws and regulations. This tracking is conducted by using electronic tags on plants and shipments between licensees and facilities. 
 See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses associated with the Company's operations in Colorado. 
 Regulation of the Medical and Adult-Use Marijuana Markets in Connecticut 
 In 2012, Connecticut has authorized cultivation, possession, and distribution of cannabis for medical purposes by certain licensed Connecticut cannabis businesses. The Medical Marijuana Program MMP ), registers qualifying patients, primary caregivers, Dispensary Facilities, or DFs, and Dispensary Facility Employees, or DFEs. The MMP was established by Connecticut General Statutes 21a-408 21a429. DFs and production facilities are separately licensed. 
 The MMP is administered by the Department of Consumer Protection DCP ). Patients with qualifying debilitating medical conditions qualify to participate in the program, including patients with such conditions include but are not limited to cancer, glaucoma, positive status for HIV, AIDS, Parkinson s disease, or multiple sclerosis (MS). A physician , physician's assistant or advanced practice registered nurse must issue a written certification for an MMP patient, and the qualifying patient or caregiver must choose one designated DF where the patient s cannabis will be obtained. In Connecticut, marijuana may not be produced or dispensed without the appropriate license. 
 When the DCP determines that additional licenses for DFs should be granted, it publishes a notice of open applications for DF licenses. This notice must include the maximum number of licenses to be granted, the deadline for receipt of applications, and the criteria that will be considered when awarding the licenses. Such criteria must include character and fitness of any person who may have control or influence over the operation of the proposed DF; the location for the proposed DF; the applicant s ability to maintain adequate controls against the diversion, theft, or loss of cannabis; the applicant s ability to maintain the knowledge, understanding, judgment, procedures, security controls, and ethics to ensure optimal safety and accuracy in the dispensing and sale of cannabis; and the extent to which the applicant or any of the applicant s DF backers have a financial interest in another licensee, registrant, or applicant. 
 Applicants for DF licenses must identify, among other things, the proposed DF location, financial statements, criminal background check applications for the applicant and applicant s backers, a plan to prevent theft and diversion, and a blueprint of the proposed DF. There are currently 18 DFs. 
 
 Connecticut Dispensary Facility Requirements (Medical) 
 A DF may not dispense marijuana from, obtain marijuana from, or transfer marijuana to a location outside of the state of Connecticut. 
 DFs may dispense and sell marijuana to a qualifying patient or primary caregiver registered who is registered with the DCP or to a research program subject pursuant to the protocols of a research program approved by the Commissioner. 

A DF may also transport and deliver marijuana to a hospice or other licensed inpatient care facility, an approved laboratory, and directly to a qualifying patient. 

Only a pharmacist licensed as a dispensary may dispense cannabis, and only a dispensary or dispensary technician may sell cannabis to qualifying customers, primary caregivers, or research program subjects who are registered with the DCP. No person associated with a DF may enter into any agreement with a certifying health care provider or health care facility concerning the provision of services or equipment that may adversely affect any person s freedom to choose the DF at which the qualifying customer 
 20 

or primary caregiver will purchase cannabis, except in the case of an approved research program. All DFEs must, at all times while at the DF, have their current dispensary license, dispensary technician registration, or DFE registration available for inspection by the Commissioner or the DCP. The DF shall establish, implement and adhere to a written alcohol-free, drug-free, and smoke-free workplace policy, which must be available to the DCP upon request. Cannabis may not be applied, ingested, or consumed inside a DF. 
 Each DF must make publicly available the price of all its cannabis products to prospective qualifying patients and primary caregivers. As of December 9, 2022, the DCP increased the monthly allotments for qualifying patients from 3.0 ounces to 5.0 ounces. All cannabis must be sold in child-resistant, sealed containers except upon a written request from the qualifying patient or primary caregiver. All products sold to the qualifying patient or primary caregiver must be placed in an opaque package that shall not indicate the contents of the package, the originating facility, or in any other way cause another person to believe that the package may contain cannabis. Each DF must also provide information to qualifying patients and primary caregivers regarding the possession and use of cannabis. The DF manager must submit all informational material to the Commissioner for approval prior to such information being provided to qualifying patients and primary caregivers. 
 
 Connecticut Security and Storage Requirements (Medical) 
 All facilities must have an adequate security system to prevent and detect the loss of cannabis. These systems must use commercial grade equipment, including perimeter alarms, motion detectors, video cameras with 24-hour recordings (which must be retained for at least 30 days), silent alarms, panic alarms, a failure notification system, and the ability to remain operational during a power outage. Each facility must also have a backup alarm system approved by the Commissioner. The outside perimeter of every facility must be well-lit. All equipment must be kept in good working order and tested at least twice per year. 
 No person may enter the area where cannabis is dispensed and sold unless such person is licensed or registered by the DCP; such person s responsibilities necessitate access to the dispensary department and then for only as long as necessary to perform the person s job duties; or such person has a patient or caregiver registration certificate, in which case such person must not be permitted behind the service counter or in other areas where cannabis is stored. 
 
 Connecticut Transportation Requirements 
 Prior to transporting any cannabis or cannabis product, a DF must complete a shipping manifest using a form prescribed by the Commissioner and securely transmit a copy of the manifest to the laboratory, research program location, hospice, or other inpatient care facility that will receive the products and to the DCP at least 24 hours prior to transport. These manifests must be maintained and made available to the DCP. Cannabis may only be transported in a locked, secure storage compartment that is part of the vehicle transporting the cannabis. This compartment may not be visible from outside the vehicle. Routes must be randomized. 
 All transport vehicles must be staffed with a minimum of two employees. At least one delivery team member is required to remain with the vehicle at all times that the vehicle contains cannabis. A delivery team member must have access to a secure form of communication with employees at the originating facility at all times that the vehicle contains cannabis. A delivery team member must physically possess a department-issued identification card at all times when transporting or delivering cannabis and must produce it to the Commissioner or law enforcement official upon request. 
 No cannabis may be sold, dispensed, or distributed via a delivery service or any other manner outside of a DF without the approval of DCP. Beginning on July 1, 2021, DFs were permitted to deliver medical marijuana to a patient using the DFR's employees; this authorization will expire 30 days after the first five delivery service licensees have commenced public operation. A primary caregiver may deliver cannabis to the caregiver s qualified patient and a DFE may deliver to a hospice or other inpatient care facility licensed by the Department of Public Health that has a protocol for handling and distributing cannabis that has been approved by the DCP. 
 
 Inspections by the Commissioner 
 All documents required to be kept by a facility must be maintained in an auditable format for no less than three years. These records must be provided to the Commissioner or an authorized delegate immediately upon request. Additionally, the Commissioner and authorized delegates may enter any place, including a vehicle, where cannabis is held, produced, or otherwise handled, and inspect in a reasonable manner such place and all pertinent items and documents within it. 
 
 Regulation of the Connecticut Adult-Use Marijuana Market 
 On June 22, 2021, Governor Ned Lamont signed into law Senate Bill 1201, the Responsible and Equitable Regulation of Adult-Use Cannabis Act RERACA ), authorizing the possession of certain quantities of marijuana for adults over the age of 21,effective 
 21 

July 1, 2021, and creates a framework for the regulation of adult-use marijuana cultivation, production, distribution, and sale to consumers over the age of 21. On October 1, 2021, the DCP issued operational policies and procedures and implemented the licensing framework for the cultivators, micro-cultivators, product manufacturers, food and beverage manufacturers, product packagers, retailers, hybrid retailers, transporters, and delivery services. 
 Half of the licenses are to be granted to social equity applicants defined as people who have lived in geographic areas disproportionately impacted by the war on drugs and who make no more than three times the state s median income. Beginning on February 4, 2022, the state s existing medical marijuana dispensaries were permitted to convert to hybrid retailers without applying to the lottery process for new licenses, to serve both medical and adult-use consumers. In order to convert, applicants must have a Social Equity Council-approved workforce development plan and pay a fee of 1 million, or 500,000 if the dispensary has committed to creating at least one equity joint venture. Hybrid retailers must maintain a licensed pharmacist on premises at all times when the hybrid retail location is open to the public or to qualifying patients and caregivers. The hybrid retailer must also accommodate an expedited method of entry that allows for priority entrance into the premises for qualifying patients and caregivers. Additionally, the license conversion requires a DF to submit to, and obtain approval from the DCP for, a detailed medical marijuana preservation plan for how it will prioritize sales and access to medical marijuana products for qualifying patients, including, but not limited to, managing customer traffic flow, preventing supply shortages, providing delivery services and ensuring appropriate staffing safeguards. On November 22, 2022 and December 9, 2022, DCP announced that several MMP licensees successfully completed the license conversion process to additionally serve the adult-use marijuana market including three producers and nine DP s. 
 In February 2023, Trulieve obtained a license as a hybrid retailer and began adult-use cannabis sales in the state. 
 See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses associated with the Company's operations in Connecticut. 
 Regulation of the Medical Marijuana Market in Florida 
 In 2014, the Florida Legislature passed the Compassionate Use Act, or CUA, which was a low-THC (CBD) law, allowing marijuana containing not more than 0. 8 THC to be sold to patients diagnosed with severe seizures or muscle spasms and cancer. The CUA created a competitive licensing structure and initially allowed for one vertically integrated license to be awarded in each of five regions. The CUA set forth the criteria for applicants as well as the minimum qualifying criteria, which included the requirement to hold a nursery certificate evidencing the capacity to cultivate a minimum of 400,000 plants, to be operated by a nurseryman, and to be a registered nursery for at least 30 continuous years. The CUA also created a state registry to track dispensations. In 2016, the Florida Legislature passed the Right to Try Act RTA ), which expanded the State s medical marijuana program to allow for full potency THC products to be sold as medical marijuana to qualified patients. 
 In November of 2016, the Florida Medical Marijuana Legalization ballot initiative (referred to herein as the Initiative to expand the medical marijuana program under the RTA was approved by 71.3 of voters, thereby amending the Florida constitution. The Initiative is now codified as Article X, Section 29 of the Florida Constitution. The Initiative expanded the list of qualifying medical conditions to include cancer, epilepsy, glaucoma, HIV and AIDS, ALS, Crohn s disease, Parkinson s disease, PTSD, multiple sclerosis, and other debilitating medical conditions of the same kind or class or comparable to those other qualifying conditions and for which a physician believes the benefits outweigh the risks to the patient. The Initiative also provided for the implementation of State-issued medical marijuana identification cards. In 2017, the Florida Legislature passed legislation implementing the constitutional amendment and further codifying the changes outlined in the constitution into law. The 2017 law provides for the issuance of 10 licenses to specific entities and another four licenses to be issued for every 100,000 active qualified patients added to the registry. The 2017 law also initially limited license holders to a maximum of 25 dispensary locations with the ability to purchase additional dispensary locations from one another and for an additional five locations to be allowed by the State for every 100,000 active qualified patients added to the registry. The 2017 legislation s cap on dispensing facilities expired in April 2020. 
 Under Florida law, a licensee is required to cultivate, process, and dispense medical marijuana. Licenses are issued by the Florida Department of Health, Office of Medical Marijuana Use, or OMMU, and may be renewed biennially. Trulieve US received its most recent license renewal on July 24, 2020, and is classified as a Medical Marijuana Treatment Center, or MMTC, under Florida law. 
 There is no state-imposed limitation on the permitted size of cultivation or processing facilities in Florida, nor is there a limit on the number of plants that may be grown. The is expected to issue anywhere from 18-22 new MMTC licenses, depending on the number of registered patients at the start of the application process, beginning in 2022 with the issuance of a single license to a recognized class member of Pigford v. Glickman, 185 F.R.D. 82 (D.D.C. 1999) or In re Black Farmers Litigation, 856 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2011).

Under our license, we are permitted to sell marijuana to those customers who are entered into Florida s electronic medical marijuana use registry by a qualified physician and possess a state-issued medical marijuana identification card and a valid certification from the qualified physician. The physician determines customer eligibility as well as the routes of administration (e.g., topical, oral, inhalation sublingual, suppository, edible, and smoking marijuana) and the number of milligrams per day a customer is able to obtain under the program. The physician may order a certification for up to three 70-day supply limits of marijuana, following which the certification expires, and a physician must issue a new certification. The number of milligrams dispensed, the category of marijuana (either low-THC or medical marijuana), and whether a delivery device, such as a vaporizer, has been dispensed is all recorded in the registry for each customer transaction. In addition, smokable flower was approved by the legislature and signed into law in March 2019. Customers must obtain a specific recommendation from their physician to purchase smokable flower. The maximum amount a customer may obtain is 2.5 ounces (measured by weight) of smokable flower per 35-day supply. 
 We are authorized to sell a broad selection of products across various product categories. OMMU implemented rules regulating the production and sale of edible products in August of 2020, and the Company s Florida licensee shortly thereafter became the first MMTC to dispense edibles in Florida. OMMU implemented rules regulating the use of hydrocarbon solvents (e.g., N-butane, isobutane, propane, pentane, and heptane) for the extraction of derivative products in August 2021. Trulieve announced the first sale in Florida of hydrocarbon extraction-derived concentrate products in September 2021. 
 Dispensaries may be located in any location zoned as appropriate for a pharmacy throughout the State of Florida as long as the local government has not expressly prohibited MMTC dispensaries in their respective municipality. Additionally, dispensaries must be located more than 500 feet from a public or private elementary, middle, or secondary school. Following the adoption of the cap on total dispensaries by each MMTC, as discussed above, our Florida licensee filed a claim in the Court for the Second Judicial Circuit in Leon County challenging the dispensary cap and asking the Court to disregard the dispensary locations we had open and/or applied for prior to the limitation becoming effective. On February 4, 2019, we announced that we won our lawsuit in the trial court, with the court ruling that we may open an additional 14 dispensary locations based on these locations having previously vested. Moreover, the Court ruled that in the alternative, the statutory caps placed on the number of dispensaries allowed across the State were not only unconstitutionally added after Amendment 2 had been approved by voters but were also adversely impacting customer access. We have since settled our challenge with the Florida Department of Health. Our 14 dispensaries established before the statewide cap was enacted are now excluded from the statutory cap. The statutory cap expired in April 2020; thus, neither Trulieve US nor its competitors in Florida are subject to restrictions on the number of dispensaries that may be opened. As of January 12, 2023, we had 123 approved dispensaries in the State of Florida. In addition, our license allows us to deliver products directly to customers. 
 Florida Reporting Requirements 
 Florida law called for the OMMU to establish, maintain, and control a computer software tracking system that traces marijuana from seed to sale and allows real-time, 24-hour access by the OMMU to such data. The tracking system must allow for integration of other seed-to-sale systems and, at a minimum, include notification of certain events, including when cannabis seeds are planted, when marijuana plants are harvested and destroyed, and when cannabis is transported, sold, stolen, diverted, or lost. Each medical cannabis treatment center shall use the seed-to-sale tracking system established by the OMMU or integrate its own seed-to-sale tracking system with the seed-to-sale tracking system established by the OMMU. At this time, the OMMU has not implemented a statewide seed-to-sale tracking system; thus, we use our own seed-to-sale system. Additionally, the OMMU maintains a patient and physician registry, and licensees must comply with all requirements and regulations regarding the provision of required data or proof of key events to said system to retain their license. Florida requires all MMTCs to abide by representations made in their original application to the State of Florida or any subsequent variances to the same. The OMMU must approve any changes or expansions of previous representations and disclosures to the OMMU via an amendment or variance process. 
 
 Florida Licensing Requirements 
 Licenses issued by the OMMU may be renewed biennially so long as the licensee continues to meet the requirements of the Florida Statute 381.986 and pays a renewal fee. Individuals or entities who directly or indirectly own, control, or hold with power to vote five percent or more of the voting shares of a MMTC may not acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares or other form of ownership of any other MMTC. Applicants must demonstrate (and licensed MMTC s must maintain) that: (i) they have been registered to do business in the State of Florida for the previous five years, (ii) they possess a valid certificate of registration issued by the Florida Department of Agriculture Consumer Services, (iii) they have the technical and technological ability to cultivate and produce marijuana, including, but not limited to, low-THC marijuana, (iv) they have the ability to secure the premises, resources, and personnel necessary to operate as an MMTC, (v) they have the ability to maintain accountability of all raw materials, finished products, and any by-products to prevent diversion or unlawful access to or possession of these substances, (vi) they have an infrastructure reasonably located to dispense marijuana to registered qualified patients statewide or regionally as determined by the OMMU, (vii) they have the financial ability to maintain operations for the duration of the two-year approval cycle, including the provision of certified financial statements to the OMMU, (viii) all owners, officers, board members and managers have 
 23 

passed a Level II background screening, inclusive of fingerprinting, (ix) they ensure that a medical director is employed to supervise the activities of the MMTC, and (x) they have a diversity plan and veterans plan accompanied by a contractual process for establishing business relationships with veterans and minority contractors and/or employees. Upon approval of the application by the OMMU, the applicant must post a performance bond of up to US 5 million, which may be reduced to US 2 million once the licensee has served 1,000 patients (which Trulieve has accomplished). 
 There was a lawsuit that challenged essential aspects of the 2017 Legislation and OMMU regulations. In December 2017, Florigrown, LLC and other plaintiffs challenged aspects of the 2017 Legislation and OMMU regulations as unconstitutional due to: (1) requiring MMTCs to be vertically integrated (e.g., cultivate and process the cannabis to be sold at the MMTC s own licensed dispensaries); (2) the cap of total number of MMTC licenses in the State; and (3) the authorization of the OMMU to issue MMTC licenses to certain applicants that met criteria defined by the 2017 legislation. On October 18, 2019, a trial judge in the Circuit Court for Leon County ruled that Florigrown, LLC had a substantial likelihood of succeeding on its claims, holding that the vertical integration and licensing cap conflicted with the language in Article X, Section 29 and that the provisions in 2017 defining the criteria for eligibility for MMTC licensure constituted an impermissible special law under Article III, Section 11(a)(12) of the Florida Constitution. On July 10, 2019, an intermediate appellate court affirmed aspects of the Circuit Court for Leon County s ruling. On May 27, 2021, the Florida Supreme Court issued a 6-1 decision finding that Florigrown, LLC and the other plaintiffs did not demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of any of its constitutional claims. In effect, the Florida Supreme Court s 6-1 decision upholds Florida s regulatory scheme. 
 
 Florida Security and Storage Requirements for Cultivation, Processing and Dispensing Facilities 
 Adequate outdoor lighting is required from dusk to dawn for all MMTC facilities. 24-hour per day video surveillance is required, and all MMTCs must maintain at least a rolling 45-day period that is made available to law enforcement and the OMMU upon demand. Alarm systems must be active at all items for all entry points and windows. Interior spaces must also have motion detectors, and all cameras must have an unobstructed view of key areas. Panic alarms must also be available for employees to be able to signal authorities when needed. 
 In dispensaries, the MMTC must provide a waiting area with a sufficient seating area. There must also be a minimum of one private consultation/education room for the privacy of the patient(s) and their caregiver (if applicable). The MMTC may only dispense products between 7:00 am and 9:00 pm. All active products must be kept in a secure location within the dispensary, and only empty packaging may be kept in the dispensary s general area, which is readily accessible to customers and visitors. No product or delivery devices may be on display in the waiting area. 
 An MMTC must at all times provide secure and logged access for all marijuana materials. This includes approved vaults or locked rooms. There must be at least two employees of the MMTC, or an approved security provider on-site at all times. All employees must wear proper identification badges, and visitors must be logged in and wear a visitor badge while on the premises. The MMTC must report to local law enforcement any loss, diversion, or theft of marijuana materials within 24 hours of becoming aware of such an occurrence. 
 
 Florida Transportation Requirements 
 When transporting marijuana to dispensaries or customers for delivery, a manifest must be prepared, and transportation must be done using an approved vehicle. The marijuana must be stored in a separate, locked area of the vehicle, and at all times while in transit, there must be two people in a delivery vehicle. During deliveries, one person must remain with the vehicle. The delivery employees must at all times have identification badges. The manifest must include the following information: (i) departure date and time; (ii) name, address, and license number of the originating MMTC; (iii) name and address of the receiving entity; (iv) the quantity and form of marijuana and delivery device; (v) arrival date and time; (vi) the make, model and license plate of the delivery vehicle; and (vii) the name and signatures of the MMTC delivery employees. The MMTC must keep these manifests for inspection for up to three years. During the delivery, a copy of the manifest is also provided to the recipient. 
 
 OMMU Inspections in Florida 
 The OMMU may conduct announced or unannounced inspections of MMTCs to determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The OMMU is to inspect an MMTC upon receiving a complaint or notice that the MMTC has dispensed marijuana containing mold, bacteria, or other contaminants that may cause an adverse effect to humans or the environment. The OMMU is to conduct at least a biennial inspection of each MMTC to evaluate the MMTC s records, personnel, equipment, security, sanitation practices, and quality assurance practices.

Regulation of Medical Marijuana in Georgia 
 On April 17, 2019, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp signed into law the Hope Act, which creates a regulatory scheme to permit the production of low-THC oil, that is, oil with a THC content of no greater than 5 , for provision to patients for medical purposes. In specific, the Hope Act created a seven-member Georgia Access to Cannabis Commission (the GA Commission ), charged with drafting regulations to implement the low-THC oil program. Under the Hope Act, the GA Commission is permitted to issue up to six production licenses two Class 1 licenses allowing up to 100,000 square feet of cultivation canopy each and four Class 2 licenses allowing up to 50,000 square feet of cultivation canopy each and is also required to issue licenses to the University of Georgia and Fort Valley State University, in the event that either University chooses to participate, for cultivation and research regarding low-THC oil. The Hope Act envisions that the Georgia Board of Pharmacy would develop and oversee licensing criteria by which pharmacies would be permitted to dispense low-THC oil; the GA Commission is also expected to issue rules to license free-standing dispensaries. On July 24, 2021, the GA Commission announced its intention to award the two Class 1 and four Class 2 production licenses, including the award of one Class 1 license to Trulieve GA Inc. The regulations for the licensure of dispensaries have not yet been adopted, and so there are no currently licensed dispensaries in Georgia. 
 Georgia law requires eligible patients to obtain physician approval to be added to the Low THC Oil Registry, which is administered by the Georgia Department of Public Health. Qualifying conditions include: (1) end-stage cancer-producing wasting illness or recalcitrant nausea and vomiting,(2) severe or end-stage amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, (3) seizure disorders related to diagnosis of epilepsy or trauma-related head injuries, (4) multiple sclerosis, (5) Crohn s disease, (6) mitochondrial disease, (7) severe or end-stage Parkinson s disease, (8) severe or end-stage sickle cell disease, (9) severe Tourette s syndrome, (10) autism spectrum disorder when a patient is 18 years of age or older, or less than 18 years of age and diagnosed with severe autism, (11) epidermolysis bullosa, (12) severe or end-stage Alzheimer s diseases, (13) severe or end-stage AIDS, (14) severe or end-stage peripheral neuropathy, (15) inpatient or outpatient hospice treatment, (16) intractable pain, and (17) post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from direct exposure to or witnessing of a trauma for a patient who is at least 18 years of age. At present, Georgia law prohibits registered patients from ingesting low-THC oil through any manner that employs a heating element or similar means to produce vapors, including combustible products as well as vaporizers. 
 The Hope Act contemplates that the GA Commission will issue regulations in the following categories: 
 to establish requirements related to quality control, security, and oversight of production. In particular, licensees will be required to establish security plans that include 24/7 monitoring and intrusion detection, recording and video storage systems, and licensed security personnel. 

to establish requirements related to secured transportation of low-THC oil products and tracking of deliveries. 

to prohibit pesticides in production, except for pesticides certified as organic by the Organic Materials Review Institute or a similar standards organization. 

to establish requirements related to testing for purity and dosage levels, and to ensure that product labels accurately reflect product content. 

to establish requirements for a track and trace system. In specific, the track and trace system will be operated by a GA Commission-approved vendor that licensees will be required to use. The system will need to be capable of tracking plants, products, and registered patient purchase totals, as well as waste, transfers, conversions, sales, and returns. It will also need to be able to track plants, low-THC oil, and products throughout the entire chain of custody, as well as monitor inventory and prevent theft, loss, and diversion. The track and trace system will provide real-time data to the GA Commission related to total low-THC oil daily sales, the total number of marijuana plants currently in production, and the number of plants destroyed or disposed of. 

to require licensees to collect and report data. 

to regulate marketing and signage related to low-THC oil, including prohibiting the direct advertisement of low-THC oil to registered patients or the public. 

to prohibit cultivation, processing, and dispensing facilities within 3,000 feet of schools, early care and education programs, and places of worship. 

The GA Commission is also authorized to enforce the various regulatory requirements noted above, such as through inspections and collaboration with law enforcement. 
 See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details regarding the license associated with the Company's operations in Georgia.

Regulation of the Medical and Adult-Use Marijuana Markets in Maryland 
 Maryland's state-regulated medical marijuana program became operational on December 1, 2017. The Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission (the MMCC regulates the state program and awarded operational licenses in a highly competitive application process. One hundred two dispensary licenses were awarded out of a pool of over 800 applicants, while an original fifteen cultivation licenses were awarded out of a pool of nearly 150 applicants. In April 2018, Maryland lawmakers agreed to expand the state s medical marijuana industry by authorizing an additional twenty licenses, seven for cultivation and thirteen for processing. The state program allows access to medical marijuana for patients with chronic or debilitating diseases or medical conditions, including but not limited to: chronic pain, nausea, seizures, glaucoma, PTSD, and other conditions which are severe and for which other treatments have been ineffective. 
 There are three principal medical marijuana license categories in Maryland: (1) grower, (2) processor, and (3) dispensary. We have control and/or ownership over one grower license, one processor license, and three dispensaries. All licenses are, as of the date hereof, active with the State of Maryland. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at our facilities in Maryland. 
 All grower, processor, and dispensary establishments must register with the MMCC under the provisions of the Maryland Medical Cannabis Law, Md. Code, Health-Gen 13-3301 et seq., known as the Natalie M. LaPrade Medical Cannabis Commission. If applications contain all required information, establishments are issued a medical marijuana license. 
 Licenses are valid for a period of six years of initial licensure, and annual license fees must be paid to maintain licensure. After the expiration of the initial six-year licensure period, the licensee is required to renew the license every four years thereafter. Licensees are required to submit a renewal application per the guidelines published by the MMCC. Ninety days prior to the expiration of a license, the MMCC notifies the licensee of the date on which the license expires and provides the instructions and fee required to renew the license along with the consequences of failure to renew. At least 30 calendar days before a license expires, the licensee must submit the renewal application as provided by the MMCC. The annual licensing fee for a grower is 125,000, 40,000 for a processor, and 40,000 for a dispensary. 
 The medical grower license permits us to cultivate, manufacture, package, and distribute medical cannabis to licensed processors, licensed dispensaries, or registered independent testing laboratories. The medical processor license permits us to transform the medical cannabis into another product or extract and package and label medical cannabis. The dispensary licenses permit us to acquire, possess, repackage, process, transfer, transport, sell, distribute, or dispense products containing medical cannabis, related supplies, related products including tinctures, aerosols, oils, or ointments, or educational materials for use by a qualifying patient or caregiver. 
 
 Maryland Dispensing Requirements (Medical) 
 In order to dispense medical marijuana, a licensed dispensary is required to comply with various dispensing requirements: (1) require presentment of a written certification from a qualifying patient or caregiver, (2) query the MMCC s data network to verify that the patient is currently registered and has a certification from a provider, as well as the amount of medical marijuana that has already been dispensed pursuant to the written certification,(3) dispense no more than a 30-day supply, and (4) decline to dispense medical marijuana if the patient or caregiver appears to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Registered patients and caregivers are required to provide attestations relating to their knowledge of the status of medical marijuana under Maryland and Federal law, as well as limitations on the use of medical marijuana, such as keeping away from children and refraining from transfer to any other person. 
 Maryland Requirements Relating to Recordkeeping and Inventory Control (Medical) 
 Licensed growers are required to use a perpetual inventory system that identifies and tracks each lot of medical marijuana from the time of propagation to the time it is delivered to a licensed dispensary and dispensed to a qualified patient. The perpetual inventory system is required to be capable of tracking marijuana back to its original source and to promptly identify discrepancies. Each plant within the perpetual inventory system is required to be assigned a unique identifier that is traceable through the entire production and dispensing lifecycle. Licensees are required to investigate discrepancies identified by the perpetual inventory system and to report such discrepancies to the MMCC and Maryland State Police where the licensee finds evidence of theft or diversion. 
 Licensed growers, processors, and dispensaries are required to retain, independent of the required inventory control system, a searchable, secure, tamper-evident record of distribution regarding the names and addresses of recipients, the quantity provided, and the name, strength, batch number and lot number of the product provided. Such records must be available to certifying providers upon request. Licensees are also required to retain records of production and distribution of each batch and lot and of daily checklists 
 26 

to maintain uniformity from batch to batch, as well as a log of all visitors to licensed premises. Records must be kept in duplicate at a secure off-site location. 
 Maryland Requirements Relating to Security (Medical) 
 Licensees are required to take measures to ensure the safety and security of licensed premises such as: (1) constructing the premises so as to prevent unauthorized entry, (2) constructing secure rooms for the storage of marijuana that are not along the exterior wall of a facility and that have access-controlled entry, (3) utilizing exterior lighting fixtures to ensure proper surveillance, (4) installing security alarms covering perimeter entry points, which shall be continuously monitored, (5) installing separate alarm systems to protect on-site and off-site record storage areas, as well as areas used for marijuana storage, and (6) utilizing motion-activated video surveillance that covers entrances and exits to a facility, as well as any area that marijuana is packaged, tested, processed, stored, or dispensed. 
 Maryland Reporting Requirements (Medical) 
 The State of Maryland uses METRC as the state s computerized seed-to-sale tracking system. Individual licensees, whether directly or through third-party integration systems, are required to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements. We use a third-party application for our computerized seed to sale software, which integrates with the state s METRC program and captures the required data points for growing, processing and, dispensing as required in the Maryland Medical Cannabis law. 
 MMCC Inspections (Medical) 
 Licensees are required to submit to announced and unannounced inspections by the MMCC, including but not limited to inspections based upon an allegation of noncompliance. 
 Regulation of the Adult-Use Marijuana Market 
 On November 8, 2022, Maryland voters approved a statewide referendum which legalizes marijuana for adults 21 years or older beginning in July 2023 and directs the Maryland State Legislature to pass laws for the use, distribution, regulation, and taxation of marijuana during the 2023 legislative session (January 11 April 10, 2023). While sales may begin as early as July 1, 2023, the specifics surrounding the program's licensing structure and timeline will be determined within the statutory framework and related regulations promulgated thereafter which have not yet been determined. 
 See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses associated with the Company's operations in Maryland. 
 Regulation of the Medical and Adult-Use Marijuana Markets in Massachusetts 
 The Commonwealth of Massachusetts authorizes the cultivation, possession, and distribution of marijuana for medical purposes by certain licensed Massachusetts marijuana businesses. The Medical Use of Marijuana Program, or MUMP, registers qualifying patients, personal caregivers, Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers, or MTCs, and MTC agents. The MUMP was established by Chapter 369 of the Acts of 2012, An Act for the Humanitarian Medical Use of Marijuana, following the passage of the Massachusetts Medical Marijuana Initiative in the 2012 general election. MTC Licenses are vertically integrated licenses in that each MTC license holder must cultivate, process, and dispense medical marijuana. The Cannabis Control Commission, or CCC, assumed control of the MUMP from the Department of Public Health on December 23, 2018. The CCC approved revised regulations for the MUMP on November 30, 2020, and the revised regulations became effective on January 8, 2021. 
 The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission, or CCC, regulations, 935 CMR 501.000 et seq. (referred to herein as the Massachusetts Medical Regulations ), provide a regulatory framework that requires MTCs to cultivate, process, transport, and dispense medical cannabis in a vertically integrated marketplace. Patients with debilitating medical conditions qualify to participate in the program, including conditions such as cancer, glaucoma, positive status for HIV, AIDS, hepatitis C, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Crohn s disease, Parkinson s disease, and multiple sclerosis (MS) when such diseases are debilitating, and other debilitating conditions as determined in writing by a qualifying patient s healthcare provider. 
 Massachusetts Licensing Requirements (Medical) 
 The Massachusetts Medical Regulations delineate the licensing requirements for MTCs in Massachusetts. Licensed entities must demonstrate the following: (i) they are licensed and in good standing with the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; the Massachusetts Department of Revenue DOR ), and the Massachusetts Department of Unemployment Assistance DUA ); (ii) no person or entity has Direct or Indirect Control over more than three MTC licenses; (iii) under a single MTC License, a licensee may not operate more than two locations in Massachusetts at which medical marijuana is cultivated, marijuana infused 
 27 

products are manufactured, and marijuana is dispensed; (iv) MTC agents must be registered with the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission; (v) an MTC must have a program to provide reduced cost or free marijuana to patients with documented verifiable financial hardships; (vi) one executive of an MTC must register with the Massachusetts Department of Criminal Justice Information Services on behalf of the entity as an organization user of the Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) system; (vii) the MTC applicant has initial capital resources of at least 500,000 in its control for its first license application and 400,000 for subsequent license applications, as evidenced by bank statements, lines of credit or equivalent; and (viii) payment of the required application fee. 
 MTC Licenses in Massachusetts are renewed annually. While renewals are granted annually, there is no ultimate expiry after which no renewals are permitted. Additionally, in respect of the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and there are no material violations noted against the applicable license, we would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business. 
 Massachusetts Dispensary Requirements (Medical) 
 An MTC must follow its written and approved operating procedures in the operation of its dispensary locations. Operating procedures must include (i) security measures in compliance with the Massachusetts Medical Regulations; (ii) employee security policies including personal safety and crime prevention techniques; (iii) hours of operation and after-hours contact information; (iv) a price list for marijuana products; (v) storage and waste disposal protocols in compliance with state law; (vi) a description of the various strains of marijuana that will be cultivated and dispensed, and the forms that will be dispensed; (vii) procedures to ensure accurate recordkeeping including inventory protocols; (viii) plans for quality control; (ix) a staffing plan and staffing records; (x) diversion identification and reporting protocols; (xi) policies and procedures for the handling of cash on MTC premises including storage, collection frequency and transport to financial institutions; (xii) emergency procedures and procedures to promote workplace safety; (xiii) alcohol, smoke and drug free workplace policies; (xiv) plan for maintaining confidential information and records; (xv) procedures for determining prices and provision of free or reduced costs marijuana and marijuana products to patients with verified financial hardships; (xvi) policies and procedures for energy efficiency and conservation; and (xvii) procedures for patient education activities. The siting of dispensary locations is expressly subject to local/municipal approvals pursuant to state law, and municipalities may impose local permitting and licensing requirements that an MTC must comply with. The Massachusetts Medical Regulations require that MTCs limit their inventory of seeds, plants, and usable marijuana to reflect the projected needs of registered qualifying patients. An MTC may only dispense to a registered qualifying patient or caregiver who has a currently valid certification. 
 Massachusetts Security and Storage Requirements (Medical) 
 An MTC must implement sufficient security measures to deter and prevent unauthorized entrance into areas containing marijuana and theft of marijuana at the MTC. These measures include, but are not limited to: (i) allowing only registered qualifying patients, caregivers, dispensary agents, authorized persons, or approved outside contractors access to the MTC facility; (ii) disposing of marijuana or by-products in compliance with the law; (iii) establishing limited access areas accessible only to authorized personnel; (iv) storing finished marijuana in a secure locked safe or vault; (v) keeping equipment, safes, vaults or secured areas securely locked; (vi) ensuring that the outside perimeter of the MTC is sufficiently lit to facilitate surveillance; and (vii) ensuring that landscaping or foliage outside of the MTC does not allow a person to conceal themselves. An MTC shall also utilize a security/alarm system that: (i) monitors entry and exit points and perimeter windows, (ii) includes a panic, duress, or holdup alarm, (iii) includes system failure notifications, (iv) includes 24-hour video surveillance of safes, vaults, sales areas, areas where marijuana is cultivated, processed or dispensed, and (v) includes date and time stamping of all recordings and the ability to produce a clear, color still photo. The security system shall have the capacity to remain operational during a power outage. The MTC must also maintain a backup alarm system with the capabilities of the primary system, and both systems are to be maintained in good working order and are to be inspected and tested at regular intervals. 
 Massachusetts Transportation Requirements (Medical) 
 Marijuana and marijuana-infused products, or MIPs, may be transported between licensed MTCs by MTC agents or agents of a licensed Marijuana Transporter on behalf of an MTC. MTCs or licensed Marijuana Couriers may, with CCC approval, transport marijuana or MIPS directly to registered qualifying customers and Caregivers as part of a home delivery program. An MTC shall staff transport vehicles with a minimum of two MTC agents. At least one agent shall remain with the vehicle when the vehicle contains marijuana or MIPs. Prior to leaving the origination location, an MTC must weigh, inventory, and account for, on video, the marijuana to be transported. 
 Marijuana products must be packaged in sealed, labeled, and tamper-proof or child-resistant packaging prior to and during transportation. An MTC shall ensure that transportation times and routes are randomized. Each MTC agent shall carry his or her CCC-issued Agent Registration Card when transporting marijuana or MIPs and shall produce it to CCC representatives or law enforcement officials upon request. Where videotaping is required when weighing, inventorying, and accounting of marijuana before 
 28 

transportation or after receipt, the video must show each product being weighed, the weight, and the manifest. An MTC must document and report any unusual discrepancy in weight or inventory to the CCC and local law enforcement within 24 hours. 
 An MTC shall report to the CCC and local law enforcement any vehicle accidents, diversions, losses, or other reportable incidents that occur during transport within 24 hours. Vehicles used in transportation must be owned or leased, be properly registered, and contain a GPS system that is monitored during transport of marijuana and said vehicle must be inspected and approved by the CCC prior to use. 
 During transit, an MTC must ensure that: (i) marijuana or MIPs are transported in a secure, locked storage compartment that is part of the vehicle transporting the marijuana or MIPs; (ii) the storage compartment cannot be easily removed (for example, bolts, fittings, straps or other types of fasteners may not be easily accessible and not capable of being manipulated with commonly available tools); (iii) marijuana or MIPs are not visible from outside the vehicle; (iv) product is transported in a vehicle that bears no markings indicating that the vehicle is being used to transport marijuana or MIPs. Each MTC agent transporting marijuana or MIPs shall have access to a secure form of communication with personnel at the origination location when the vehicle contains marijuana or MIPs. 
 CCC Inspections (Medical) 
 The CCC or its agents may inspect an MTC and affiliated vehicles at any time without prior notice. An MTC shall immediately, upon request, make available to the CCC information that may be relevant to a CCC inspection, and the CCC may direct an MTC to test marijuana for contaminants. Any violations found may be noted in a deficiency statement that will be provided to the MTC, and the MTC shall thereafter submit a Plan of Correction to the CCC outlining with particularity each deficiency and the timetable and steps to remediate the same. The CCC shall have the authority to suspend or revoke an MTC License in accordance with the applicable regulations. 
 Regulation of the Adult-Use Marijuana Market in Massachusetts 
 Adult-use marijuana has been legal in Massachusetts since December 15, 2016, following a ballot initiative in November of that year. The CCC licenses various types of adult-use marijuana businesses, including cultivators, product manufacturers, and retailers (referred to herein collectively as Marijuana Establishments pursuant to 935 CMR 500.000 et seq. The first adult-use marijuana facilities in Massachusetts began operating in November 2018. The CCC approved revised regulations for the adult-use program effective November 1, 2019, and January 8, 2021. 
 Massachusetts Licensing Requirements (Adult-Use) 
 Many of the same application requirements exist for an adult-use Marijuana Establishment license application as to those for a medical MTC application, and each person having Direct or Indirect Control must undergo background checks and fingerprinting with the CCC. Applicants must submit the location and identification of each site and must establish a property interest in the same, and the applicant and the local municipality must have entered into a host community agreement authorizing the location of the adult-use Marijuana Establishment within the municipality and a host community agreement certification form must be included in the application. Applicants must include disclosure of any regulatory actions against it by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as well as the civil, criminal, and administrative history of the applicant and all persons and entities having Direct or Indirect Control. The application must include, amongst other information, a detailed summary describing the Marijuana Establishment s proposed operating policies, including security, prevention of diversion, storage, transportation, inventory procedures, quality control, dispensing procedures, personnel policies, record keeping, maintenance of financial records, diversity plans, and employee training protocols. 
 Massachusetts Dispensary Requirements (Adult-Use) 
 Marijuana retailers are subject to certain operational requirements in addition to those imposed on Marijuana Establishments generally. Dispensaries must immediately inspect consumers identification to ensure that everyone who enters is at least 21 years of age. Dispensaries may not sell more than one ounce of marijuana or five grams of marijuana concentrate per transaction. Point-of-sale systems must be approved by the CCC, and retailers must record sales data. Records must be retained and available for auditing by the CCC and Department of Revenue. Retailers are required to conduct monthly analyses of equipment and sales data to determine that such systems have not been altered or interfered with to manipulate sales data, and to report any such discrepancies to the CCC. 
 Dispensaries must also make educational materials available to consumers in commonly spoken languages designated by the CCC, with analogous materials for visually- and hearing-impaired persons. Such materials must include: 
 a warning that marijuana has not been analyzed or approved by the FDA, that there is limited information on side effects, that there may be health risks associated with using marijuana, and that it should be kept away from children; 

29 

a warning that when under the influence of marijuana, driving is prohibited, and machinery should not be operated;

materials offered to consumers to enable them to track the strains used and their associated effects; 

information describing proper dosage and titration for different routes of administration, with an emphasis on using the smallest amount possible to achieve the desired effect and the impact of potency; 

a discussion of tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal; 

facts regarding substance use disorder signs and symptoms, as well as referral information for substance use disorder treatment programs; 

a statement that consumers may not sell marijuana to any other individual; 

information regarding penalties for possession or distribution of marijuana in violation of Massachusetts law; 

Massachusetts Security and Storage Requirements (Adult-Use) 
 Each Marijuana Establishment must implement sufficient security measures to deter and prevent unauthorized entrance into areas containing marijuana and theft of marijuana at the establishment. Massachusetts imposes robust security requirements on licensed establishments. 
 
 Massachusetts Transportation Requirements (Adult-Use) 
 Marijuana products may only be transported between licensed Marijuana Establishments by registered Marijuana Establishment agents. A licensed marijuana transporter may contract with a Marijuana Establishment to transport that licensee s marijuana products to other licensed establishments. All transported marijuana products are linked to the seed-to-sale tracking program. Any marijuana product that is undeliverable or is refused by the destination Marijuana Establishment shall be transported back to the originating establishment. All vehicles transporting marijuana products shall be staffed with a minimum of two Marijuana Establishment agents. Prior to the products leaving a Marijuana Establishment, the originating Marijuana Establishment must weigh, inventory, and account for, on video, all marijuana products to be transported. Within eight hours after arrival at the receiving Marijuana Establishment, the receiving establishment must re-weigh, re-inventory, and account for, on video, all marijuana products transported. Marijuana products must be packaged in sealed, labeled, and tamper or child-resistant packaging prior to and during transportation. A Marijuana Establishment or a marijuana transporter transporting marijuana products is required to ensure that all transportation times and routes are randomized and remain within Massachusetts. 
 Vehicles must additionally be equipped with a video system that includes one or more cameras in the storage area of the vehicle and one or more cameras in the driver area of the vehicle. The video cameras must remain operational at all times during the transportation process and have the ability to produce a clear color still photo, whether live or recorded, with a date and time stamp embedded, and that does not significantly obscure the picture. 
 Vehicles used for transport must be owned or leased by the Marijuana Establishment or transporter, and they must be properly registered, inspected, and insured in Massachusetts. Marijuana may not be visible from outside the vehicle, and it must be transported in a secure, locked storage compartment. Each vehicle must have a global positioning system, and any agent transporting marijuana must have access to a secure form of communication with the originating location. 
 CCC Inspections 
 The CCC or its agents may inspect a Marijuana Establishment and affiliated vehicles at any time without prior notice. All areas of a Marijuana Establishment, all Marijuana Establishment agents and activities, and all records are subject to such inspection. During an inspection, the CCC may direct a marijuana establishment to test marijuana for contaminants as specified by the CCC. Moreover, the CCC is authorized to conduct a secret shopper program to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. 
 Regulatory Changes for Medical and Adult Use Marijuana in Massachusetts 
 The CCC voted to adopt significant amendments of both the medical and adult-use marijuana regulations at its meeting on November 30, 2020. The new regulations became effective on January 8, 2021. Significant changes included: 
 permitting Marijuana Courier Licensees to deliver directly to consumers from the premises of licensed marijuana retailer establishments and Marijuana Delivery Operators to purchase wholesale marijuana products directly from marijuana cultivation and product manufacturer establishments and deliver the products directly to consumers from the Delivery

 Regulation of the Medical Market in Ohio 
 On June 8, 2016, former Ohio Governor John Kasich signed House Bill 523 into law, sanctioning the use of marijuana for limited medical purposes and establishing a commercial marijuana regulatory regime. Qualifying conditions for access to medical marijuana under the program include, but are not limited to, chronic and severe pain, post-traumatic stress disorder and cancer. Ohio s medical cannabis program is regulated by both the Ohio Department of Commerce Department of Commerce and the Ohio Board of Pharmacy Ohio Board ). The Department of Commerce is responsible for licensing cultivators, processors and testing laboratories, while the Ohio Board is responsible for registering patients and caregivers as well as licensing medical marijuana dispensaries. Final regulations governing the program, including applications for business licensure, the operation of commercial medical cannabis establishments, physician certifications and patient registration have been adopted. 
 
 Ohio Licenses and Regulations 
 Ohio s medical cannabis program allows businesses to be structured as for-profit entities and does not impose residency requirements for investment or ownership in a commercial cannabis license. Ohio s licensing structure permits, but does not require, vertical integration. Each license (cultivation, processor and dispensary) is issued on an individual basis for each facility type/function. There are three different types of processors stand-alone, vertically integrated facilities and a plant-only processor, which is a cultivator who distributes plant material directly to dispensaries. Cultivators can grow, harvest, package, and transport medical marijuana. Dispensaries can sell medical marijuana to qualifying patients and caregivers. Processors can manufacture medical marijuana products. 
 Notably, there is a requirement that a dispensary license must have been continually operational for one year prior to any change of ownership. Common ownership between cultivation, processing and dispensing licenses is permitted, but prohibited for cannabis testing licensees. However, no one entity or person may own, have a financial interest in or significantly influence or control the activities of more than one cultivation license, more than one processing license or more than five dispensary licenses at any given time. 
 A license expires annually on the date it was issued. Facility Renewal Application and renewal fee must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the expiration date of the certificate of operation. Failure to do so may result in action from the state. A renewal application will be granted if the application is filed in a timely manner, the licensee submits the corresponding renewal fee, the department confirms that nothing warrants the denial of the renewal under the Administrative Code, and the licensee passes a full inspection, unless a full inspection was passed within three months before the renewal date. 
 
 Dispensing Operations 
 
 A dispensary employee must require the presentation of a valid registry identification card together with another form of approved state-issued photographic identification belonging to a qualifying patient or caregiver prior to selling medical marijuana to such qualifying patient or caregiver. Patients and caregivers may only purchase a forty-five day supply of medical marijuana during their respective fill period. 
 
 Requirements Relating to Recordkeeping and Inventory Control 
 
 All licensees are required to maintain a record of all inventory and transactions of medical marijuana in the statewide inventory tracking system, METRC. Each dispensary is required to keep a record of all medical marijuana received, dispensed, sold, destroyed, or used. 
 
 31 

Ohio Requirements Related to Security 
 
 The Board and the Department require licensees to maintain extensive security policies, procedures, and measures such as on-site security during operational hours, access controls, a security system that s operational at all times and uses commercial grade equipment, and alarms. 
 See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses associated with the Company's operations in Ohio. 
 Regulation of the Medical Marijuana Market in Pennsylvania 
 The Pennsylvania medical marijuana program was signed into law on April 17, 2016, under Act 16, otherwise known as the Medical Marijuana Act, and provided access to state residents with one or more qualifying conditions. 
 Under Act 16, medical marijuana refers to marijuana obtained for certified medical use by a Pennsylvania resident with at least 1 of 23 qualifying medical conditions as set by the Pennsylvania Department of Health DOH ). Act 16 initially authorized 17 qualifying conditions; However, through regulatory approval, that list has expanded and now also includes any terminal illness, dyskinetic and spastic movement disorders, and opioid use disorder. 
 Under Act 16 and the DOH s implementing regulations, patients who are residents of Pennsylvania and have a qualifying serious medical condition as certified by a physician are able to obtain medical marijuana at approved dispensaries within the Pennsylvania. A registered caregiver of an approved patient may also obtain medical marijuana from an approved dispensary. Pennsylvania does not permit home delivery of medical marijuana other than through a registered caregiver. 
 In July 2022, Governor Wolf signed H.B. 331 (also known as Act 52), which provides additional protections under Pennsylvania law for financial institutions and insurers providing services to, or for the benefit of, a legitimate cannabis-related business. Act 52 also explicitly states that financial institutions and insurers are not obligated to provide services to marijuana businesses within the Commonwealth. Additionally, Act 52 requires marijuana businesses that are receiving financial or insurance services from a provider within Pennsylvania to disclose any suspension or revocation of marijuana-related permits, registrations, or certifications to the financial institution and/or insurer within five business days. 
 In October 2022, the DOH finalized its medical marijuana regulations. These final regulations mirror the temporary regulations and reflect the DOH s efforts to keep pace with the growth and evolution of the medical marijuana program. The final regulations also account for many of the changes made by Act 44. The final regulations include notable updates on the following topics: 
 Background checks, changes of ownership, and changes of location. 

Packaging and labeling requirements, including that labels must contain the species and percentages of all cannabinoids and individual terpenes. 

Facility signage and security requirements. 

Testing requirements, including that grower/processors must use separate testing laboratories for harvest and process testing. 

Act 16 authorized two principal categories of permits for medical marijuana organizations MMO ): (1) a grower/ processor permit and (2) a dispensary permit. Act 16 authorized the DOH to issue up to 25 grower/processor permits and up to 50 dispensary permits. A dispensary permit holder may have up to three dispensary locations within the primary region in which the primary facility is located. Pennsylvania is divided into six regions, with permits being awarded based on the patient population. 
 Pennsylvania also allows for a clinical registrant permit, which allows clinical registrant permit holders to operate both a grower/processor operation and multiple dispensary locations. Additionally, clinical registrants must partner with an approved medical research institution within Pennsylvania to conduct marijuana-based clinical research programs. 
 All grower/processor and dispensary facilities must register with the DOH. Registration certificates are valid for a period of one year and are subject to continuing reporting and annual renewal requirements. A grower/processor permit allows a permit holder to acquire wholesale from another grower/processor, possess, cultivate, and manufacture/process into medical marijuana products and/or medical marijuana-infused products, deliver, transfer, have tested, transport, supply, or sell marijuana and related supplies to medical marijuana dispensaries. A grower/processor may transport products itself or may contract with an approved transporter. A grower/processor is not limited to distributing in the region in which it is located and may distribute medical marijuana products to any approved dispensary facility within the Commonwealth. 
 32 

Pennsylvania Dispensing Requirements 
 Approved dispensaries may only purchase approved medical marijuana products from a permitted grower/processor and may only dispense to certified patients or caregivers who present valid identification cards. Prior to dispensing medical marijuana products to a patient or caregiver, the dispensary shall: (1) verify the validity of the patient or caregiver identification card using the electronic tracking system; and (2) review the information on the patient s most recent certification by using the electronic tracking system to access the DOH s database. The following requirements apply: (i) if a practitioner sets forth recommendations, requirements or limitations as to the form and/or dosage of a medical marijuana product on the patient certification, the medical marijuana product dispensed to a patient or caregiver by a dispensary must conform to those recommendations, requirements or limitations; (ii) if a practitioner does not set forth recommendations, requirements or limitations as to the form or dosage of a medical marijuana product on the patient certification, the physician, pharmacist, physician assistant or certified registered nurse practitioner employed by the dispensary and working at the facility shall consult with the patient or the caregiver regarding the appropriate form and dosage of the medical marijuana product to be dispensed; and (iii) the dispensary shall update the patient certification in the electronic tracking system by entering any recommendation as to the form or dosage of medical marijuana product that is dispensed to the patient. 
 Pennsylvania Requirements Relating to Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Inventory Control 
 All permit holders are required to use the DOH-approved seed-to-sale tracking software for all inventory management and tracking. Permit holders must perform, at a minimum, monthly and annual inventory reviews that are maintained in an electronic record. Permit holders must have an electronic back-up system for all electronic records. Pennsylvania currently utilizes the MJFreeway platform. 
 Pennsylvania Requirements Relating to Security 
 All permit holders must employ security and surveillance systems, utilizing commercial-grade equipment, to prevent unauthorized entry and to prevent and detect an adverse loss. Permit holders must employ a professionally-monitored security and surveillance system that is operational 24 hours per day, 7 days per week and records all activity in images capable of clearly revealing facial detail. The permit holder must designate an employee to continuously monitor the security and surveillance systems at the facility. 
 Permit holders must retain at the facility, for at least four years, records of all inspections, servicing, alterations and upgrades performed on the systems. A permit holder must provide up to four screen captures of an unaltered copy of a video surveillance recording to the DOH or its authorized agents, law enforcement, or other Federal, State or local government officials if necessary to perform the government officials functions and duties. 
 Permit holders must install commercial-grade, nonresidential steel doors and door locks on each room where medical marijuana products are stored and on each external door of the facility. Keys or key codes for all doors must remain in the possession of designated authorized individuals. During all nonworking hours, all entrances to and exits from the facility must be securely locked. Permit holders must install lighting to ensure proper surveillance inside and outside of the facility. Permit holders must limit access to any room containing security and surveillance monitoring equipment to persons who are essential to maintaining security and surveillance operations; Federal, State and local law enforcement; security and surveillance system service employees; the DOH or its authorized agents; and other persons with the prior written approval of the DOH. The permit holder must make available to the DOH a current list of authorized employees and service employees or contractors who have access to any security and surveillance areas. Permit holders must keep security and surveillance rooms locked at all times and may not use these rooms for any other purpose or function. 
 Pennsylvania Department of Health Inspections 
 The Pennsylvania DOH may conduct announced or unannounced inspections or investigations to determine the MMO s compliance with its permit. An investigation or inspection may include an inspection of an MMO s site, facility, vehicles, books, records, papers, documents, data, and other physical or electronic information. 
 See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses associated with our operations in Pennsylvania. 
 Regulation of the Medical Marijuana Market in West Virginia 
 On April 19, 2017, West Virginia Governor Jim Justice signed into law Senate Bill 386, which created a medical marijuana program for West Virginia residents with serious medical conditions, and permits medical marijuana to be cultivated, processed, and dispensed to registered patients in essentially non-combustible forms. The program is administered by the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health, Office of Medical Cannabis. The Office of Medical Cannabis has authority to (1) issue and oversee permits that 
 33 

authorize businesses to grow, process, or dispense medical cannabis in compliance with state law and regulations, (2) register medical practitioners who certify patients as having qualifying serious medical conditions, and (3) register and oversee patients with qualifying conditions. 
 The statute establishes a list of qualifying conditions, including (1) cancer, (2) positive status for HIV/AIDS, (3) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, (4) Parkinson s disease, (5) multiple sclerosis, (6) spinal cord injury, (7) epilepsy, (8) neuropathy, (9) Huntington s disease, (10) Crohn s disease, (11) post-traumatic stress disorder, (12) intractable seizures, (13) sickle cell anemia, (14) severe chronic pain, and (15) illness with a prognosis of less than one year of life expectancy. 
 Medical marijuana products initially allowed were pills, oils, gels, creams, ointments, tinctures, liquid, and non-whole plant forms for administration through vaporization. In 2020, the legislature passed Senate Bill 339, adding dry leaf or plant form. Dispensaries cannot sell edibles, but medical marijuana products could be mixed into food or drinks by patients themselves. Vaporization (or oils) is allowed, but smoking is prohibited. 
 In addition to Senate Bill 386, the Office of Medical Cannabis has also promulgated regulations codified in Chapter 16A of the West Virginia Code governing the activities of growers, processors, laboratories, dispensaries, and general provisions of West Virginia s medical marijuana program. 
 The West Virginia statute creates three categories of licenses that a marijuana business may obtain: (1) grower, (2) processor, and (3) dispensary, corresponding to the growing of medical marijuana, the processing of cannabis plants into the products permitted under West Virginia law, and sales to registered patients, respectively. The statute provides that the Office may issue up to ten grower permits, ten processor permits, and one hundred dispensary permits and that it may not (1) issue more than one grower permit to one person, (2) issue more than one processor permit to one person, and (3) issue more than ten dispensary permits to one person. 
 A permittee is permitted to transport and deliver medical marijuana to a medical marijuana organization or an approved laboratory. A grower/processor may contract with a third-party contractor for delivery so long as the contractor complies with the Office of Medical Cannabis rules and regulations. A grower/processor must use a global positioning system to ensure safe, efficient delivery of the medical marijuana to a medical marijuana organization or an approved laboratory. Vehicles permitted to transport medical marijuana must be equipped with a secure lockbox or locking cargo area, have no markings that would either identify or indicate that the vehicle is being used to transport medical marijuana, be capable of being temperature-controlled for perishable medical marijuana, as appropriate, display current state inspection stickers and maintain a current state vehicle registration, and be insured in an amount that is commercially reasonable and appropriate. Medical marijuana stored inside the transport vehicle may not be visible from the outside of the transport vehicle. A transport vehicle is subject to inspection by the bureau or its authorized agents, law enforcement, or other federal or state officials if necessary to perform the government officials functions and duties. The Office of Medical Cannabis awarded ten grower permits on October 3, 2020. It awarded ten processor permits on November 13, 2020. It awarded one hundred dispensary permits on January 29, 2021, and announced that beginning February 3, 2021, West Virginia residents with qualifying medical conditions would be able to begin to submit applications to become registered patients. As of January 2023, there are nine operational growers, six operational processors, and forty operational dispensaries. Currently, there are approximately 17,473 approved medical marijuana patients in West Virginia. 
 Permits issued by the Office of Medical Cannabis are effective for one year from the date of issuance and may be renewed by applicants in good standing with the terms of a currently effective permit. Permits may be suspended or revoked on the basis of failure to prevent diversion of medical marijuana or violation of laws and rules applicable to medical marijuana businesses. 
 West Virginia Dispensing Requirements 
 Dispensaries are prohibited from dispensing marijuana products to anyone other than a registered patient or caregiver who presents a valid identification card from the Office of Medical Cannabis. Dispensing amounts are limited to those indicated in a registered patient s certification by his/her medical practitioner, and in any event, a dispensary may not dispense more than a 30-day supply at a given time. A dispensary may not provide medical marijuana at no cost or make the dispensing of medical marijuana conditional upon the purchase of a medical device, instrument, or service provided at the dispensary or another location. Dispensaries may not deliver medical marijuana to a patient or caregiver s home or any other location. A dispensary may only dispense medical marijuana to a patient or caregiver who presents a valid identification card to an employee at the facility who is authorized to dispense medical marijuana at the facility. 
 West Virginia Requirements Relating to Recordkeeping and Inventory Control 
 All permittees are required to make use of a state-mandated electronic tracking system that is accessible to the Office of Medical Cannabis. Permittees must maintain inventory data in the electronic tracking system, including medical marijuana products ready for sale and those awaiting disposal. At a minimum, permittees must perform monthly and annual inventories, which must be 
 34 

memorialized in an electronic record. West Virginia currently utilizes the METRC inventory tracking system. Growers and processors are required to contract with independent laboratories to test their products according to Office of Medical Cannabis rules. 
 Permittees must have security and surveillance systems utilizing commercial-grade equipment to prevent unauthorized entry and to prevent and detect an adverse loss. The security systems must incorporate a professionally monitored security alarm system that is operational 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and records all activity in images capable of clearly revealing facial detail; have the ability to clearly and accurately display the date and time; record all images captured by each surveillance camera for a minimum of two years in a format that may be easily accessed for investigative purposes; and utilize a security alarm system separate from the facility s primary security system covering the limited access area or other room where the recordings are stored. Permittees must install commercial-grade, non-residential doors and door locks on each external door of the facility, with keys or key codes for all doors remaining in possession of designated authorized individuals. During all nonworking hours, all entrances to and exits from the site and facility must be securely locked. Permittees must install lighting to ensure proper surveillance both inside and outside of the facility. Access to rooms containing security and surveillance monitoring equipment must be limited to persons who are essential to maintaining security and surveillance operations; federal, state, and local law enforcement; security and surveillance system service employees; the bureau or its authorized agents; and other persons with the prior written approval of the Office of Medical Cannabis. 
 West Virginia Office of Medical Cannabis Inspections 
 The Office of Medical Cannabis is permitted to conduct announced or unannounced inspections of permittees to determine their compliance with West Virginia law and regulations, and may inspect a permittee s site, records, and other data, and may interview employees, principals, operators, and financial backers of the permittee. The Office of Medical Cannabis will have free access to review and, if necessary, make copies of books, records, papers, documents, data, or other physical or electronic information that relates to the business of the dispensary, including financial data, sales data, shipping data, pricing data, and employee data. The Office of Medical Cannabis will have free access to any area within a site or facility that is being used to store medical cannabis for testing purposes and are permitted to collect test samples for testing at an approved laboratory.

Risks Related to Our Business and Industry 
 Cannabis is illegal under United States federal law. 
 In the United States, or the U.S., cannabis is largely regulated at the state level. Each state in which we operate (or are currently proposing to operate) authorizes, as applicable, medical and/or adult-use cannabis production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, and numerous other states have legalized cannabis in some form. However, under U.S. federal law, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of cannabis and any related drug paraphernalia is illegal, and any such acts are criminalized under the Controlled Substances Act, as amended, which we refer to as the CSA. Cannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA, and is thereby deemed to have a high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use in the United States, and a lack of safety for use under medical supervision. The concepts of medical cannabis, retail cannabis and adult-use cannabis do not exist under U.S. federal law. However, in October of 2022, the Biden Administration announced its intention to review the regulation of cannabis under the CSA by directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General to initiate the administrative process to expeditiously review marijuana s Schedule I status. While this directive could result in the decriminalization of marijuana for medical and adult-use by descheduling or rescheduling marijuana, there are no assurances if or when there could be any change in the regulation of marijuana under the CSA. Although we believe that our business activities are compliant with applicable state and local laws in the United States, strict compliance with state and local cannabis laws would not provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against us. Any such proceedings may result in a material adverse effect on us. We derive 100 of our revenues from the cannabis industry. The enforcement of applicable U.S. federal laws poses a significant risk to us. 
 Violations of any United States federal laws and regulations could result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, or settlements arising from civil proceedings conducted by either the United States federal government or private citizens. We may also be subject to criminal charges under the CSA, and if convicted could face a variety of penalties including, but not limited to, disgorgement of profits, cessation of business activities or divestiture. Any of these penalties could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and ability to conduct our business, our holding (directly or indirectly) of medical and adult-use cannabis licenses in the United States, our financial position, operating results, profitability or liquidity or the market price of our publicly-traded shares. In addition, it is difficult for us to estimate the time or resources that would be needed for the investigation, settlement or trial of any such proceedings or charges, and such time or resources could be substantial. 
 The regulation of cannabis in the United States is uncertain. 
 Our activities are subject to regulation by various state and local governmental authorities. Our business objectives are contingent upon, in part, compliance with regulatory requirements enacted by these governmental authorities and obtaining all regulatory approvals necessary for the sale of our products in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any delays in obtaining or failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals would significantly delay our development of markets and products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, although we believe that our operations are currently carried out in accordance with all applicable state and local rules and regulations, no assurance can be given that new rules and regulations will not be enacted or that existing rules and regulations will not be applied in a manner that could limit or curtail our ability to distribute or produce marijuana. Amendments to current laws and regulations governing the importation, distribution, transportation and/or production of marijuana, or more stringent implementation thereof could have a substantial adverse impact on us. 
 We may be subject to constraints on and differences in marketing our products under varying state laws. 
 Certain of the states in which we operate have enacted strict regulations regarding marketing and sales activities on cannabis products. There may be restrictions on sales and marketing activities imposed by government regulatory bodies that could hinder the development of our business and operating results. Restrictions may include regulations that specify what, where and to whom product information and descriptions may appear and/or be advertised. Marketing, advertising, packaging and labeling regulations also vary from state to state, potentially limiting the consistency and scale of consumer branding communication and product education efforts. The regulatory environment in the U.S. limits our ability to compete for market share in a manner similar to other industries. If we are unable to effectively market our products and compete for market share, or if the costs of compliance with government legislation and regulation cannot be absorbed through increased selling prices for our products, our sales and operating results could be adversely affected. 
 The cannabis industry is relatively new. 
 We are operating in a relatively new industry and market. In addition to being subject to general business risks, we must continue to build brand awareness in this industry and market share through significant investments in our strategy, production capacity, quality assurance and compliance with regulations. Research in Canada, the United States and internationally regarding the medical benefits, viability, safety, efficacy and dosing of cannabis or isolated cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol, or CBD, and 
 38 

tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, remains in relatively early stages. Few clinical trials on the benefits of cannabis or isolated cannabinoids have been conducted. Future research and clinical trials may draw opposing conclusions to statements contained in the articles, reports and studies currently favored, or could reach different or negative conclusions regarding the medical benefits, viability, safety, efficacy, dosing or other facts and perceptions related to medical cannabis, which could adversely affect social acceptance of cannabis and the demand for our products and dispensary services. 
 Accordingly, there is no assurance that the cannabis industry and the market for medicinal and/or adult-use cannabis will continue to exist and grow as currently anticipated or function and evolve in a manner consistent with management s expectations and assumptions. Any event or circumstance that adversely affects the cannabis industry, such as the imposition of further restrictions on sales and marketing or further restrictions on sales in certain areas and markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We face risks due to industry immaturity or limited comparable, competitive or established industry best practices. 
 As a relatively new industry, there are not many established operators in the medical and adult use cannabis industries whose business models we can follow or build upon. Similarly, there is no or limited information about comparable companies available for potential investors to review in making a decision about whether to invest in us. 
 Shareholders and investors should consider, among other factors, our prospects for success in light of the risks and uncertainties encountered by companies, like us, that are in their early stages. For example, unanticipated expenses and problems or technical difficulties may occur, which may result in material delays in the operation of our business. We may fail to successfully address these risks and uncertainties or successfully implement our operating strategies. If we fail to do so, it could materially harm our business to the point of having to cease operations and could impair the value of the Subordinate Voting Shares to the extent that investors may lose their entire investments. 
 Our ability to grow our medical and adult-use cannabis product offerings and dispensary services may be limited. 
 As we introduce or expand our medical and adult-use cannabis product offerings and dispensary services, we may incur losses or otherwise fail to enter certain markets successfully. Our expansion into new markets may place us in competitive and regulatory environments with which we are unfamiliar and involve various risks, including the need to invest significant resources and the possibility that returns on those investments will not be achieved for several years, if at all. In attempting to establish new product offerings or dispensary services, we may incur significant expenses and face various other challenges, such as expanding our work force and management personnel to cover these markets and complying with complicated cannabis regulations that apply to these markets. In addition, we may not successfully demonstrate the value of these product offerings and dispensary services to consumers, and failure to do so would compromise our ability to successfully expand these additional revenue streams. 
 We may acquire other companies or technologies. 
 Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to grow our business in response to the demands of consumers and other constituents within the cannabis industry as well as competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may determine to do so through the acquisition of complementary businesses rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. In addition, we may not realize the expected benefits from completed acquisitions. The risks we face in connection with acquisitions include: 
 Diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges; 

Coordination of research and development and sales and marketing functions; 

Retention of employees from the acquired company; 

Cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization; 

Integration of the acquired company's accounting, management information, human resources, and other administrative systems; 

The need to implement or improve controls, procedures, and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked effective controls, procedures, and policies; 

Potential write-offs of intangible assets or other assets acquired in transactions that may have an adverse effect on our operating results in a given period; 

Liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; and 

39 

Litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, consumers, former stockholders, or other third parties. 

Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with any future acquisitions or investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally. Future acquisitions could also result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, or the impairment of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. 
 We may issue additional Subordinate Voting Shares in connection with such transactions, which would dilute our other shareholders interests in us. The presence of one or more material liabilities of an acquired company that are unknown to us at the time of acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, prospects and financial condition. A strategic transaction may result in a significant change in the nature of our business, operations and strategy. In addition, we may encounter unforeseen obstacles or costs in implementing a strategic transaction or integrating any acquired business into our operations. 
 If we cannot manage our growth, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may be subject to growth-related risks, including capacity constraints and pressure on our internal systems and controls. Our ability to manage growth effectively will require us to continue to implement and improve our operational and financial systems and to expand, train and manage our employee base. Our inability to successfully manage our growth may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 
 Anti-Money Laundering Laws in the United States may limit access to funds from banks and other financial institutions. 
 In February 2014, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, bureau of the United States Treasury Department issued guidance (which is not law) with respect to financial institutions providing banking services to cannabis businesses, including burdensome due diligence expectations and reporting requirements. While the guidance advised prosecutors not to focus their enforcement efforts on banks and other financial institutions that serve marijuana-related businesses, so long as they meet certain conditions, this guidance does not provide any safe harbors or legal defenses from examination or regulatory or criminal enforcement actions by the United States Department of Justice, or DOJ, FinCEN or other federal regulators. Because of this and the fact that the guidance may be amended or revoked at any time, most banks and other financial institutions have not been willing to provide banking services to cannabis-related businesses. In addition to the foregoing, banks may refuse to process debit card payments and credit card companies generally refuse to process credit card payments for cannabis-related businesses. As a result, we may have limited or no access to banking or other financial services in the United States and may have to operate our United States business on an all-cash basis. If we are unable or limited in our ability to open or maintain bank accounts, obtain other banking services or accept credit card and debit card payments, it may be difficult for us to operate and conduct our business as planned. Although, we are actively pursuing alternatives that ensure our operations will continue to be compliant with the FinCEN guidance (including requirements related to disclosures about cash management and U.S. federal tax reporting), we may not be able to meet all applicable requirements. 
 We are also subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the U.S. that involve money laundering, financial recordkeeping and proceeds of crime, including the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (commonly known as the Bank Secrecy Act), as amended by Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the USA PATRIOT Act, and any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines, issued, administered or enforced by governmental authorities in the U.S. 
 In the event that any of our operations or related activities in the United States were found to be in violation of money laundering legislation or otherwise, those transactions could be viewed as proceeds of crime under one or more of the statutes noted above or any other applicable legislation. This could restrict or otherwise jeopardize our ability to declare or pay dividends or effect other distributions. 
 The re-classification of cannabis or changes in U.S. controlled substance laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 If cannabis is re-classified as a Schedule II or lower controlled substance under the CSA, the ability to conduct research on the medical benefits of cannabis would most likely be more accessible; however, if cannabis is re-categorized as a Schedule II or lower controlled substance, the resulting re-classification would result in the need for approval by United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, if medical claims are made about our medical cannabis products. As a result of such a re-classification, the manufacture, importation, exportation, domestic distribution, storage, sale and use of such products could become subject to a 
 40 

significant degree of regulation by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA. In that case, we may be required to be registered to perform these activities and have the security, control, recordkeeping, reporting and inventory mechanisms required by the DEA to prevent drug loss and diversion. Obtaining the necessary registrations may result in delay of the manufacturing or distribution of our products. The DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to restrict, suspend or revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings. 
 Potential regulation by the FDA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Should the United States federal government legalize cannabis, it is possible that the FDA would seek to regulate it under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act of 1938. Additionally, the FDA may issue rules and regulations, including good manufacturing practices related to the growth, cultivation, harvesting and processing of medical cannabis. Clinical trials may be needed to verify efficacy and safety of our medical cannabis products. It is also possible that the FDA would require that facilities where medical-use cannabis is grown register with the agency and comply with certain federally prescribed regulations. In the event that some or all of these regulations are imposed, the impact on the cannabis industry is uncertain and could include the imposition of new costs, requirements, and prohibitions. If we are unable to comply with the regulations or registration as prescribed by the FDA, it may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 Our contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing control over the variable interest entities as direct ownership. 
 We rely on contractual arrangements with certain of our entities to operate dispensaries or own our licenses or cultivation assets in certain states in which our direct ownership of operations is restricted or prohibited. If our variable interest entities or their equity holders fail to perform their respective obligations under the contractual arrangements, we may have to incur substantial costs and expend additional resources to enforce such arrangements. Accordingly, these contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing us with control over our variable interest entities. 
 Under our contractual arrangements, we may not be able to directly change the members of the boards of directors of these entities and would have to rely on the variable interest entities and the variable interest entity equity holders to perform their obligations in order to exercise our control over the variable interest entities. The variable interest entity equity holders may have conflicts of interest with us and they may not act in our best interests or may not perform their obligations under these contracts. For example, our variable interest entities and their respective equity holders could breach their contractual arrangements with us by, among other things, failing to conduct their operations (including failing to maintain licenses or comply with applicable ownership or reporting requirements) or taking other actions that are detrimental to our interests. If any equity holder is uncooperative and any dispute relating to these contracts or the replacement of the equity holders remains unresolved, we will have to enforce our rights under the contractual arrangements and through arbitral or judicial agencies, which may be costly and time-consuming and may be limited by legal principles preventing the enforcement of a contract it involves a violation of law or public policy. See There is doubt regarding our ability to enforce contracts. If we are unable to enforce the contractual arrangements, we may not be able to exert effective control over the variable interest entities, and our ability to conduct our business, as well as our financial condition and results of operations, may be materially and adversely affected. 
 We could be materially adversely impacted due to restrictions under U.S. border entry laws. 
 Because cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law, those investing in Canadian companies with operations in the U.S. cannabis industry could face detention, denial of entry or lifetime bans from the United States as a result of their business associations with U.S. cannabis businesses. Entry into the United States happens at the sole discretion of United States Customs and Border Patrol, or CBP, officers on duty, and these officers have wide latitude to ask questions to determine the admissibility of a non-U.S. citizen or foreign national. The government of Canada has started warning travelers on its website that previous use of cannabis, or any substance prohibited by U.S. federal law, could mean denial of entry to the United States. Business or financial involvement in the cannabis industry in the United States could also be reason enough for denial of entry into the United States. On September 21, 2018, the CBP released a statement outlining its current position with respect to enforcement of the laws of the United States. It stated that Canada s legalization of cannabis will not change CBP enforcement of U.S. laws regarding controlled substances. According to the statement, because cannabis continues to be a controlled substance under U.S. law, working in or facilitating the proliferation of the marijuana industry in U.S. states where it is legal under state law may affect admissibility to the United States. On October 9, 2018, the CBP released an additional statement regarding the admissibility of Canadian citizens working in the legal cannabis industry in Canada. CBP stated that a Canadian citizen working in or facilitating the proliferation of the legal cannabis industry in Canada who seeks to come into the United States for reasons unrelated to the cannabis industry will generally be admissible to the United States; however, if such person is found to be coming into the United States for reasons related to the cannabis industry, such person may be deemed inadmissible. As a result, the CBP has affirmed that employees, directors, officers, 
 41 

and managers of and investors in companies involved in business activities related to cannabis in the United States (such as Trulieve), who are not U.S. citizens face the risk of being barred from entry into the United States for life. 
 As a cannabis company, we may be subject to heightened scrutiny in Canada and the United States that could materially adversely impact the liquidity of the Subordinate Voting Shares. 
 Our existing operations in the United States, and any future operations, may become the subject of heightened scrutiny by regulators, stock exchanges and other authorities in the United States and Canada. 
 Given the heightened risk profile associated with cannabis in the United States, the Canadian Depository for Securities, or CDS, may implement procedures or protocols that would prohibit or significantly impair the ability of CDS to settle trades for companies that have cannabis businesses or assets in the United States. 
 On February 8, 2018, following discussions with the Canadian Securities Administrators and recognized Canadian securities exchanges, the TMX Group, the parent company of CDS, announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding, which we refer to as the TMX MOU, with Aequitas NEO Exchange Inc., the CSE, the Toronto Stock Exchange, and the TSX Venture Exchange. The TMX MOU outlines the parties understanding of Canada s regulatory framework applicable to the rules, procedures, and regulatory oversight of the exchanges and CDS as it relates to issuers with cannabis-related activities in the U.S. The TMX MOU confirms, with respect to the clearing of listed securities, that CDS relies on the exchanges to review the conduct of listed issuers. As a result, there is no CDS ban on the clearing of securities of issuers with cannabis-related activities in the U.S. However, there can be no assurances given that this approach to regulation will continue in the future. If such a ban were to be implemented, it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of holders of the Subordinate Voting Shares to settle trades. In particular, the Subordinate Voting Shares would become highly illiquid until an alternative was implemented, and investors would have no ability to effect a trade of the Subordinate Voting Shares through the facilities of a stock exchange. 
 We expect to incur significant ongoing costs and obligations related to our investment in infrastructure, growth, regulatory compliance and operations. 
 We expect to incur significant ongoing costs and obligations related to our investment in infrastructure and growth and for regulatory compliance, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, future changes in regulations, more vigorous enforcement thereof or other unanticipated events could require extensive changes to our operations, increase our compliance costs or give rise to material liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our efforts to grow our business may be more costly than expected, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset these higher operating expenses. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays, and other unknown events. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market price of our securities may significantly decrease. 
 The market for the Subordinate Voting Shares may be limited for holders of our securities who live in the United States. 
 Given the heightened risk profile associated with cannabis in the United States, capital markets participants may be unwilling to assist with the settlement of trades for U.S. resident securityholders of companies with operations in the U.S. cannabis industry, which may prohibit or significantly impair the ability of securityholders in the United States to trade our securities. In the event residents of the United States are unable to settle trades of our securities, this may affect the pricing of such securities in the secondary market, the transparency and availability of trading prices and the liquidity of these securities. 
 We may not be able to locate and obtain the rights to operate at preferred locations. 
 In certain markets the local municipality has authority to choose where any cannabis establishment will be located. These authorized areas are frequently removed from other retail operations. Because the cannabis industry remains illegal under U.S. federal law, the disadvantaged tax status of businesses deriving their income from cannabis, and the reluctance of the banking industry to support cannabis businesses, it may be difficult for us to locate and obtain the rights to operate at various preferred locations. Property owners may violate their mortgages by leasing to us, and those property owners that are willing to allow use of their facilities may require payment of above fair market value rents to reflect the scarcity of such locations and the risks and costs of providing such facilities. 
 As a cannabis business, we are subject to certain tax provisions that have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Under Section 280E of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the IRC, no deduction or credit shall be allowed for any amount paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business if such trade or business (or the activities which comprise such trade or business) consists of trafficking in controlled substances (within the meaning of schedule I and II of 
 42 

the Controlled Substances Act) which is prohibited by Federal law or the law of any State in which such trade or business is conducted. This provision has been applied by the United States Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, to cannabis operations, prohibiting them from deducting expenses directly associated with cannabis businesses. Section 280E may have a lesser impact on cannabis cultivation and manufacturing operations than on sales operations. Section 280E and related IRS enforcement activity has had a significant impact on the operations of cannabis companies. As a result, an otherwise profitable business may, in fact, operate at a loss, after taking into account its United States income tax expenses. 
 We expect to be subject to taxation in both Canada and the United States, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We are a Canadian corporation, and as a result generally would be classified as a non-United States corporation under the general rules of U.S. federal income taxation. IRC Section 7874, however, contains rules that can cause a non-United States corporation to be taxed as a United States corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under IRC Section 7874, a corporation created or organized outside of the United States will nevertheless be treated as a United States corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which is referred to as an inversion, if each of the following three conditions are met: (i) the non-United States corporation acquires, directly or indirectly, or is treated as acquiring under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, substantially all of the assets held, directly or indirectly, by a United States corporation, (ii) after the acquisition, the former stockholders of the acquired United States corporation hold at least 80 (by vote or value) of the shares of the non-United States corporation by reason of holding shares of the acquired United States corporation, and (iii) after the acquisition, the non-United States corporation s expanded affiliated group does not have substantial business activities in the non-United States corporation s country of organization or incorporation when compared to the expanded affiliated group s total business activities. 
 Pursuant to IRC Section 7874, we are classified as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and are subject to U.S. federal income tax on our worldwide income. Regardless of any application of IRC Section 7874, however, we expect to be treated as a Canadian resident company for purposes of the Canadian Income Tax Act, as amended. As a result, we are subject to taxation both in Canada and the U.S., which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may not have access to United States bankruptcy protections available to non-cannabis businesses. 
 Because cannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA, many courts have denied cannabis businesses federal bankruptcy protections, making it difficult for lenders to be made whole on their investments in the cannabis industry in the event of a bankruptcy. If we were to experience a bankruptcy, there is no guarantee that United States federal bankruptcy protections would be available to us, which would have a material adverse effect on us and may make it more difficult for us to obtain debt financing. 
 We are a holding company and our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to shareholders may be limited. 
 Trulieve Cannabis Corp. is a holding company and essentially all of its assets are the capital stock of its subsidiaries. We currently conduct substantially all of our business through Trulieve US, which currently generates substantially all of our revenues. Consequently, our cash flows and ability to complete current or desirable future growth opportunities are dependent on the earnings of Trulieve US and our other subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to Trulieve Cannabis Corp. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and other distributions will depend on those subsidiaries operating results and will be subject to applicable laws and regulations that require that solvency and capital standards be maintained by a subsidiary company and contractual restrictions contained in the instruments governing any current or future indebtedness of our subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of Trulieve US or another of our subsidiaries, holders of indebtedness and trade creditors of that subsidiary may be entitled to payment of their claims from that subsidiary s assets before we or our shareholders would be entitled to any payment or residual assets. 
 There is doubt regarding our ability to enforce contracts. 
 It is a fundamental principle of law that a contract will not be enforced if it involves a violation of law or public policy. Because cannabis remains illegal at a federal level in the United States, judges in multiple states have on a number of occasions refused to enforce contracts for the repayment of money when the loan was used in connection with activities that violate U.S. federal law, even if there is no violation of state law. There remains doubt and uncertainty that we will be able to legally enforce our contracts. If we are unable to realize the benefits of or otherwise enforce the contracts into which we enter, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We face increasing competition that may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We face competition from companies that may have greater capitalization, access to public equity markets, more experienced management or more maturity as a business. The vast majority of both manufacturing and retail competitors in the cannabis market 
 43 

consists of localized businesses (those doing business in a single state), although there are a few multistate operators with which we compete directly. Aside from this direct competition, out-of-state operators that are capitalized well enough to enter markets through acquisitive growth are also part of the competitive landscape. Similarly, as we execute our growth strategy, operators in our future state markets will inevitably become direct competitors. We are likely to continue to face increasing and intense competition from these companies. Increased competition by larger and better financed competitors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 If the number of users of adult-use and medical marijuana in the United States increases, the demand for products will increase. Consequently, we expect that competition will become more intense as current and future competitors begin to offer an increasing number of diversified products to respond to such increased demand. To remain competitive, we will require a continued investment in research and development, marketing, sales and client support. We may not have sufficient resources to maintain sufficient levels of investment in research and development, marketing, sales and client support efforts to remain competitive, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The cannabis industry is undergoing rapid growth and substantial change, which has resulted in an increase in competitors, consolidation and the formation of strategic relationships. Acquisitions or other consolidating transactions could harm us in a number of ways, including losing customers, revenue and market share, or forcing us to expend greater resources to meet new or additional competitive threats, all of which could harm our operating results. As competitors enter the market and become increasingly sophisticated, competition in our industry may intensify and place downward pressure on retail prices for our products and services, which could negatively impact our profitability. 
 We are subject to limits on our ability to own the licenses necessary to operate our business, which will adversely affect our ability to grow our business and market share in certain states. 
 In certain states, the cannabis laws and regulations limit not only the number of cannabis licenses issued, but also the number of cannabis licenses that one person or entity may own in that state. Such limitations on the acquisition of ownership of additional licenses within certain states may limit our ability to grow organically or to increase our market share in affected states. 
 Our subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain necessary permits and authorizations. 
 Our subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain the necessary licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations or accreditations to operate their respective businesses, or may only be able to do so at great cost. In addition, our subsidiaries may not be able to comply fully with the wide variety of laws and regulations applicable to the cannabis industry. Such laws and regulations include requirements to use state mandated information technology reporting systems that may not fully integrate with our information technology systems. Failure to comply with or to obtain the necessary licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations or accreditations could result in restrictions on a subsidiary s ability to operate in the cannabis industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 We may not be able to accurately forecast our operating results and plan our operations due to uncertainties in the cannabis industry. 
 Because U.S. federal and state laws prevent widespread participation in and otherwise hinder market research in the medical and adult-use cannabis industry, the third-party market data available to us is limited and unreliable. Accordingly, we must rely largely on our own market research to forecast sales as detailed forecasts are not generally obtainable from other sources at this early stage of the cannabis industry. Our market research and projections of estimated total retail sales, demographics, demand, and similar consumer research are based on assumptions from limited and unreliable market data, and generally represent the personal opinions of our management team. A failure in the demand for our products to materialize as a result of competition, technological change or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. 
 We are subject to risks related to growing an agricultural product. 
 Our business involves the growing of cannabis, an agricultural product. Such business is subject to the risks inherent in the agricultural business, such as losses due to infestation by insects or plant diseases and similar agricultural risks. Although much of our growing is expected to be completed indoors, there can be no assurance that natural elements will not have a material adverse effect on our future production. 
 We may encounter unknown environmental risks. 
 There can be no assurance that we will not encounter hazardous conditions, such as asbestos or lead, at the sites of the real estate used to operate our businesses, which may delay the development of our businesses. Upon encountering a hazardous condition, work at our facilities may be suspended. If we receive notice of a hazardous condition, we may be required to correct the condition prior 
 44 

to continuing construction. If additional hazardous conditions were present, it would likely delay construction and may require significant expenditure of our resources to correct the conditions. Such conditions could have a material impact on our investment returns. 
 We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property. 
 As long as cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA, the benefit of certain federal laws and protections that may be available to most businesses, such as federal trademark and patent protection, may not be available to us. As a result, our intellectual property may never be adequately or sufficiently protected against the use or misappropriation by third parties. In addition, since the regulatory framework of the cannabis industry is in a constant state of flux, we can provide no assurance that we will ever obtain any protection for our intellectual property, whether on a federal, state or local level. 
 Our property is subject to risk of civil asset forfeiture. 
 Because the cannabis industry remains illegal under U.S. federal law, any property owned by participants in the cannabis industry that is either used in the course of conducting or comprises the proceeds of a cannabis business could be subject to seizure by law enforcement and subsequent civil asset forfeiture. Even if the owner of the property were never charged with a crime, the property in question could still be seized and subject to an administrative proceeding by which, with minimal process, it could become subject to forfeiture. 
 Our internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective, and our independent auditors may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business. 
 We are subject to various SEC reporting and other regulatory requirements. We have incurred and will continue to incur expenses and, to a lesser extent, diversion of our management s time in our efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 regarding internal controls over financial reporting. Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm when required, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retrospective changes to our consolidated financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our Subordinate Voting Shares. 
 The risk of negative effects related to a known material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. 
 We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and our management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective. While we are working to remediate any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting, we cannot assure that additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not occur in the future. 
 Ineffective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors or misstatements in our financial statements, reduce investor confidence, and adversely impact our stock price. As discussed in Part II, Item 9A Controls and Procedures in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, we identified material weaknesses related to information technology general controls, valuation of inventory, and the identification and evaluation of variable interest entities. 
 We are in the process of remediating the material weaknesses, as described in Part II, Item 9A Controls and Procedures . While significant progress has been made to enhance our internal control over financial reporting, we are still in the process of building and enhancing our processes, procedures, and controls. Additional time is required to complete the remediation of the material weaknesses and the assessment to ensure the sustainability of these remediation actions. There can be no assurance that the additional processes, procedures, and controls that we have implemented while we work to remediate the material weaknesses or that other material weaknesses will not arise in the future. If the additional processes, procedures, and controls that we have implemented while we work to remediate the material weaknesses are not sufficient, or if we identify additional control deficiencies that individually or together constitute significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, our ability to accurately record, process, and report financial information and consequently, our ability to prepare financial statements within required time periods, could be adversely affected. Failure to properly remediate the material weaknesses or the discovery of additional control deficiencies could result in violations of applicable securities laws, CSE listing requirements, subject us to litigation and investigations, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements, and adversely impact our stock price and ability to access capital markets.

We are highly dependent on certain key personnel. 
 We depend on key managerial personnel, including Kim Rivers, our Chief Executive Officer, for our continued success, and our anticipated growth may require additional expertise and the addition of new qualified personnel. Qualified individuals within the cannabis industry are in high demand and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain qualified management personnel, or be unable to attract or retain personnel necessary to operate or expand our business. The loss of the services of existing personnel or our failure to recruit additional key managerial personnel in a timely manner, or at all, could harm our business development programs and our ability to manage day-to-day operations, attract collaboration partners, attract and retain other employees, and generate revenues, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We face inherent risks of liability claims related to the use of our products. 
 As a distributor of products designed to be ingested by humans, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims, regulatory action and litigation if our products cause or are alleged to have caused significant loss or injury. We may be subject to various product liability claims, including, among others, that our products caused injury or illness, include inadequate instructions for use or include inadequate warnings concerning possible side effects or interactions with other substances. A product liability claim or regulatory action against us, whether or not successful, could result in materially increased costs, adversely affect our reputation with our clients and consumers generally, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 We may become party to litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business which could adversely affect our business. Should any litigation in which we become involved be determined against us, such a decision could adversely affect our ability to continue operating and the market price for the Subordinate Voting Shares. Even if we achieve a successful result in any litigation in which we are involved, the costs of litigation and redirection of our management s time and attention could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 We face risks related to our products. 
 We have committed and expect to continue committing significant resources and capital to develop and market existing products and new products and services. These products are relatively untested in the marketplace, and we cannot assure shareholders and investors that we will achieve market acceptance for these products, or other new products and services that we may offer in the future. Moreover, these and other new products and services may be subject to significant competition with offerings by new and existing competitors in the industry. In addition, new products and services may pose a variety of challenges and require us to attract additional qualified employees. The failure to successfully develop, manage and market these new products and services could seriously harm our business, prospects, revenue, results of operation and financial condition. 
 Our medical marijuana business may be impacted by consumer perception of the cannabis industry, which we cannot control or predict. 
 We believe that the medical marijuana industry is highly dependent upon consumer perception regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of medical marijuana distributed to those consumers. Consumer perception of our products may be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, regulatory investigations, litigation, media attention and other publicity regarding the consumption of medical marijuana products. There can be no assurance that future scientific research, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other research findings or publicity will be favorable to the medical marijuana market or any particular product, or consistent with earlier publicity. Future research reports, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other publicity that are perceived as less favorable than, or that question, earlier research reports, findings or publicity could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 Product recalls could result in a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Manufacturers and distributors of products are sometimes subject to the recall or return of their products for a variety of reasons, including product defects, such as contamination, unintended harmful side effects or interactions with other substances, packaging safety and inadequate or inaccurate labelling disclosure. The list includes specified vape products produced in our Pennsylvania operations. If any of our products are recalled due to an alleged product defect or for any other reason, we could be required to incur the unexpected expense of the recall and any legal proceedings that might arise in connection with the recall. We may lose a significant amount of sales and may not be able to replace those sales at an acceptable margin or at all. In addition, a product recall may require significant management attention. Although we have detailed procedures in place for testing our products, there can be no assurance that any quality, potency or contamination problems will be detected in time to avoid unforeseen product recalls, regulatory action or lawsuits. Additionally, if one of our significant brands were subject to recall, the image of that brand and our company generally could be harmed. Any recall could lead to decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse 
 46 

effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, product recalls may lead to increased scrutiny of our operations by regulatory agencies, requiring further management attention and potential legal fees and other expenses. 
 We are subject to security risks related to our products as well as our information and technology systems. 
 Given the nature of our product and its limited legal availability, we are at significant risk of theft at our facilities. A security breach at one of our facilities could expose us to additional liability and to potentially costly litigation, increase expenses relating to the resolution and future prevention of these breaches and may deter potential customers from choosing our products. 
 In addition, we collect and store personal information about our customers and we are responsible for protecting that information from privacy breaches. We store certain personally identifiable information and other confidential information of our customers on our systems and applications. Though we maintain robust, proprietary security protocols, we may experience attempts by third parties to obtain unauthorized access to the personally identifiable information and other confidential information of our customers. This information could also be otherwise exposed through human error or malfeasance. The unauthorized access or compromise of this personally identifiable information and other confidential information could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 A privacy breach may occur through procedural or process failure, information technology malfunction, or deliberate unauthorized intrusions. Theft of data for competitive purposes, particularly customer lists and preferences, is an ongoing risk whether perpetrated via employee collusion or negligence or through deliberate cyber-attack. Any such theft or privacy breach would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our operations depend and will depend, in part, on how well we protect our networks, equipment, information technology, or IT, systems and software against damage from a number of threats, including, natural disasters, intentional damage and destruction, fire, power loss, hacking, computer viruses, vandalism and theft. Our operations also depend and will continue to depend on the timely maintenance, upgrade and replacement of networks, equipment, IT systems and software, as well as preemptive expenses to mitigate the risks of failures. Any of these and other events could result in information system failures, delays and/or increase in capital expenses. The failure of information systems or a component of information systems could, depending on the nature of any such failure, adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. 
 We face exposure to fraudulent or illegal activity by employees, contractors, consultants and agents, which may subject us to investigations and actions. 
 We are exposed to the risk that any of the employees, independent contractors and consultants of our company and our subsidiaries may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates, (i) government regulations, (ii) manufacturing standards, (iii) federal and local healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, or (iv) laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. It may not always be possible for us to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions taken by us to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners in violation of U.S. federal or state or local laws. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending or asserting our rights, those actions could have a material impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 
 Our reputation and ability to do business may be negatively impacted by the improper conduct by our business partners, employees or agents. 
 In certain states, we depend on third-party suppliers to produce and ship our orders. Products purchased from our suppliers are resold to our customers. These suppliers could fail to produce products to our specifications or quality standards and may not deliver units on a timely basis. Any changes in our suppliers production or product availability could impact our ability to fulfill orders and could also disrupt our business due to delays in finding new suppliers. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners in violation of U.S. federal or state or local laws. Any failure by third-party suppliers to fulfill our production requirements or any improper acts by employees or third-parties acting on our behalf could, depending on the nature of any such failure, adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. 
 We may have increased labor costs based on union activity. 
 47 

Labor unions are working to organize workforces in the cannabis industry in general. Currently, labor organizations have been recognized as a representative of our employees in both our affiliated Reading, Pennsylvania cultivation and processing facility and our affiliated Harvest of Southwest PA, LLC d/b/a Trulieve Pittsburgh (Federal Street), dispensary location. It is possible that additional certain retail and/or manufacturing locations will be organized in the future, which could lead to work stoppages or increased labor costs and adversely affect our business, profitability and our ability to reinvest into the growth of our business. We cannot predict how stable our relationships with U.S. labor organizations would be or whether we would be able to meet any unions requirements without impacting our financial condition. Labor unions may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Work stoppages and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and sale of our products, which could strain relationships with customers and cause a loss of revenues which would adversely affect our operations. 
 We could be subject to criminal prosecution or civil liabilities under RICO. 
 The Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act RICO criminalizes the use of any profits from certain defined racketeering activities in interstate commerce. While intended to provide an additional cause of action against organized crime, due to the fact that cannabis is illegal under U.S. federal law, the production and sale of cannabis qualifies cannabis related businesses as racketeering as defined by RICO. As such, all officers, managers and owners in a cannabis related business could be subject to criminal prosecution under RICO, which carries substantial criminal penalties. 
 RICO can create civil liability as well: persons harmed in their business or property by actions which would constitute racketeering under RICO often have a civil cause of action against such racketeers, and can claim triple their amount of estimated damages in attendant court proceedings. Trulieve or its subsidiaries, as well as its officers, managers and owners could all be subject to civil claims under RICO. 
 Our significant indebtedness may adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results. 
 Our ability to make certain payments or advances will be subject to applicable laws and contractual restrictions in the instruments governing our indebtedness. The contractual restrictions in the instruments governing such indebtedness include restrictive covenants that limit our discretion with respect to certain business matters. These covenants place restrictions on, among other things, our ability to create liens or other encumbrances, to pay distributions or make certain other payments, and to sell or otherwise dispose of certain assets. A failure to comply with such obligations could result in a default, which, if not cured or waived, could permit acceleration of the relevant indebtedness. Our significant indebtedness could have important consequences, including: (i) our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or acquisitions may be limited; and (ii) all or part of our cash flow from operations may be dedicated to the payment of the principal of and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for operations. These factors may adversely affect our cash flow. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 We may be unable to obtain adequate insurance coverage. 
 We have obtained insurance coverage with respect to workers compensation, general liability, directors and officers liability, fire and other similar policies customarily obtained for businesses to the extent commercially appropriate; however, because we are engaged in and operate within the cannabis industry, there are exclusions and additional difficulties and complexities associated with our insurance coverage that could cause us to suffer uninsured losses, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and profitability. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or fully utilize such insurance coverage, if necessary. 
 We rely on key utility services. 
 Our business is dependent on a number of key inputs and their related costs, including raw materials and supplies related to our growing operations, as well as electricity, water and other local utilities. Our cannabis growing operations consume and will continue to consume considerable energy, which makes us vulnerable to rising energy costs. Accordingly, rising or volatile energy costs may, in the future, adversely impact our business and our ability to operate profitably. Additionally, any significant interruption or negative change in the availability or economics of the supply chain for our key inputs could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results. If we are unable to secure required supplies and services on satisfactory terms, it could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.

Risks Related to Owning Subordinate Voting Shares 
 A return on our securities is not guaranteed. 
 There is no guarantee that our Subordinate Voting Shares will earn any positive return in the short term or long term. A holding of Subordinate Voting Shares is speculative and involves a high degree of risk and should be undertaken only by holders whose financial resources are sufficient to enable them to assume such risks and who have no need for immediate liquidity in their investment. A holding of Subordinate Voting Shares is appropriate only for holders who have the capacity to absorb a loss of some or all of their holdings. 
 Additional issuances of Multiple Voting Shares or Subordinate Voting Shares may result in further dilution and could have anti-takeover effects. 
 We may issue additional equity or convertible debt securities in the future, which may dilute an existing shareholder s holdings. Our articles permit the issuance of an unlimited number of Multiple Voting Shares and Subordinate Voting Shares, and existing shareholders will have no pre-emptive rights in connection with such further issuances. Our board of directors has discretion to determine the price and the terms of further issuances. The ability of our board of directors to issue additional Multiple Voting shares and/or Subordinate Voting Shares could also have anti-takeover effects. Moreover, we will issue additional Subordinate Voting Shares on the conversion of the Multiple Voting Shares in accordance with their terms. To the extent holders of our options, warrants or other convertible securities convert or exercise their securities and sell Subordinate Voting Shares they receive, the trading price of the Subordinate Voting Shares may decrease due to the additional amount of Subordinate Voting Shares available in the market. We cannot predict the size or nature of future issuances or the effect that future issuances and sales of Subordinate Voting Shares will have on the market price of the Subordinate Voting Shares. Issuances of a substantial number of additional Subordinate Voting Shares, or the perception that such issuances could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for the Subordinate Voting Shares. With any additional issuance of Subordinate Voting Shares, our investors will suffer dilution to their voting power and economic interest. 
 Sales of substantial amounts of Subordinate Voting Shares by our existing shareholders in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Subordinate Voting Shares. 
 Sales of a substantial number of Subordinate Voting Shares in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, or the availability of such securities for sale, could adversely affect the prevailing market prices for the Subordinate Voting Shares. As of December 31, 2022, we had an aggregate of 262,263.86 Multiple Voting Shares outstanding, which were convertible into an aggregate of 26,226,386 Subordinate Voting Shares. If all or a substantial portion of our Multiple Voting Shares are converted into Subordinate Voting Shares, the potential for sales of substantial numbers of Subordinate Voting Shares may increase. A decline in the market prices of the Subordinate Voting Shares could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of securities should it desire to do so. 
 The market price for the Subordinate Voting Shares has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. 
 The market price for the Subordinate Voting Shares may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of which will be beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the following: (i) actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations; (ii) recommendations by securities research analysts; (iii) changes in the economic performance or market valuations of companies in the cannabis industry; (iv) additions or departures of our executive officers and other key personnel; (v) release or expiration of transfer restrictions on our issued and outstanding shares; (vi) regulatory changes affecting the cannabis industry generally and our business and operations; (vii) announcements by us and our competitors of developments and other material events; (viii) fluctuations in the costs of vital production materials and services; (ix) changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest rates and pharmaceutical product price volatility, as well as disruptions to health crisis (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), severe weather events, or armed conflicts (such as the conflict between Ukraine and Russia); significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors; (xi) operating and share price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us or from a lack of market comparable companies; (xii) false or negative reports issued by individuals or companies who have taken aggressive short sale positions; and (xiii) news reports relating to trends, concerns, technological or competitive developments, regulatory changes and other related issues in our industry or target markets. 
 Financial markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of equity securities of companies and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance, underlying asset values or prospects of those companies. Accordingly, the market price of the Subordinate Voting Shares may decline even if our operating results, underlying asset values or prospects have not changed. 
 49 

These factors, as well as other related factors, may cause decreases in asset values that are deemed to be other than temporary, which may result in impairment losses. There can be no assurance that continuing fluctuations in price and volume will not occur. If such increased levels of volatility and market turmoil continue, our operations could be adversely impacted, and the trading price of the Subordinate Voting Shares could be materially adversely affected. 
 There may not be sufficient liquidity in the markets for our Subordinate Voting Shares. 
 Our Subordinate Voting Shares are listed for trading on the CSE under the trading symbol TRUL and on the OTCQX Best Market under the symbol TCNNF. The liquidity of any market for the shares of our Subordinate Voting Shares will depend on a number of factors, including: 
 The number of shareholders; 

Our operating performance and financial condition; 

The market for similar securities; 

The extent of coverage by securities or industry analysts; and 

The interest of securities dealers in making a market in the shares. 

Risks Related to Being a Public Company 
 We are subject to increased costs as a result of being a U.S. reporting company. 
 As a public issuer, we are subject to the reporting requirements and rules and regulations under the applicable Canadian securities laws and rules of any stock exchange on which our securities may be listed from time to time. In addition, we became subject to the reporting requirements of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder on February 4, 2021. Additional or new regulatory requirements may be adopted in the future. The requirements of existing and potential future rules and regulations will increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and may also place undue strain on our personnel, systems and resources, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described in the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Overview 
 Trulieve is a vertically integrated cannabis company and multi-state operator which currently directly holds licenses to operate in ten states and has received notice of intent to award a license in an eleventh state. Headquartered in Quincy, Florida, we are the market leader for quality medical cannabis products and services in Florida and we have market leading retail operations in Arizona, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. By providing innovative, high-quality products across our brand portfolio, we aim to be the brand of choice for medical and adult-use customers in all of the markets that we serve. We operate in highly regulated markets that require expertise in cultivation, manufacturing, retail and logistics. We have developed proficiencies in each of these functions and are committed to expanding access to high quality cannabis products and delivering exceptional customer experiences. 
 All of the states in which we operate have developed programs to permit the use of cannabis products for medicinal purposes to treat specific conditions and diseases, which we refer to as medical cannabis. Recreational marijuana, or adult-use cannabis, is legal marijuana sold in licensed dispensaries to adults ages 21 and older. Thus far, of the states in which we operate, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, and Massachusetts, have adopted legislation permitting the commercialization of adult-use cannabis products. Trulieve operates its business through its directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries that hold licenses and have entered managed service agreements in the states in which they operate. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we operated 181 dispensaries, with 123 dispensaries in Florida, 20 dispensaries in Arizona, 19 affiliated dispensaries in Pennsylvania, three dispensaries in California, three dispensaries in Maryland, three dispensaries in Massachusetts, nine dispensaries in West Virginia and one dispensary in Connecticut, and we operated cultivation and processing facilities in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. 
 Components of Results of Continuing Operations 
 Revenue 
 We derive our revenue from cannabis products which we manufacture, sell and distribute to our customers by home delivery and in our dispensaries. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit includes revenue less the costs directly attributable to product sales and includes amounts paid to produce finished goods, such as flower, and concentrates, as well as packaging and other supplies, fees for services and processing, allocated overhead which includes allocations of rent, administrative salaries, utilities, and related costs. Cannabis costs are affected by various state regulations that limit the sourcing and procurement of cannabis product, which may create fluctuations in margins over comparative periods as the regulatory environment changes. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses consist of marketing expenses related to marketing programs for our products. Personnel related costs related to dispensaries are the primary costs of sales and marketing. As we continue to expand and open additional dispensaries, we expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses represent costs incurred at our corporate offices, primarily related to personnel costs, including salaries, incentive compensation, benefits, and other professional service costs, including legal and accounting. We expect to continue to invest considerably in this area to support our expansion plans and to support the increasing complexity of the cannabis business. 
 53 

Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation expense is calculated on a straight-line basis using the estimated useful life of each asset. Estimated useful life is determined by asset class and is reviewed on an annual basis and revised if necessary. Amortization expense is amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the intangible assets. Useful lives for intangible assets are determined by type of asset with the initial determination of useful life determined during the valuation of the business combination. On an annual basis, the useful lives of each intangible class of assets are evaluated for appropriateness and adjusted if appropriate. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net consist primarily of interest expense, interest income, and the impact of the revaluation of the liability classified warrants and our interest rate swap. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Provision for income taxes is calculated using the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on enacted tax rates and laws for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As we operate in the cannabis industry, we are subject to the limits of IRC Section 280E under which we are only allowed to deduct expenses directly related to costs of goods sold. 
 Financial Review 
 Highlights for the 2022 year include: 
 Revenue, net: We generated revenues of 1.24 billion from the sale of cannabis and cannabis related products, driven by our continued expansion in both our new and legacy markets. 

Gross profit: We generated gross profit of 682.0 million. 

Inventory: We ended the year with 297.8 million in inventories. 

Net Cash from Operations : We generated cash from operations of 23.1 million.

Revenue, Net 
 
 Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 1,239.8 million, an increase of 301.8 million or 32 , from 938.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in revenue is due to contributions from acquisitions, most notably, Harvest Health Recreation, Inc. Harvest in October 2021 and Anna Holdings, LLC Keystone Shops in July 2021, continued expansion into new states such as Massachusetts and West Virginia, and additional dispensaries opened in existing markets. 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 
 Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 557.8 million, an increase of 187.7 million or 51 , from 370.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily in correlation with the increase in revenues. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue was 45 for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 39 for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to increased depreciation related to capital expenditures to support business growth, new production facilities in existing markets where economies of scale are anticipated in the future, and expansion into new markets which are not fully vertical, resulting in the sale of third-party products, and therefore yield lower margin than our vertical markets. 
 55 

Gross Profit 
 
 Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 682.0 million, an increase of 114.2 million or 20 from 567.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 55 for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 61 for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to higher revenue offset by many factors including, increased wholesale business, which is generally lower margin than retail sales, increased depreciation related to capital expenditures to support business growth, new production facilities where economies of scale are anticipated in the future, and expansion into new markets which are not fully vertical, resulting in the sale of third-party products, and therefore yield lower margin than our vertical markets. 
 Sales and Marketing Expense 
 
 Sales and marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 284.9 million, an increase of 69.8 million, or 32 from 215.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, but remained consistent as a percentage of revenue. The increase in sales and marketing is the result of a higher headcount for the year, as we continue to add additional dispensaries in efforts to maintain and further drive higher growth in sales and market share as well as expanding into new markets. 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 
 General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 169.7 million an increase of 69.2 million or 69 from 100.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue increased from 11 to 14 . The increase in general and administrative expense is the result of entering new markets, ramping our infrastructure to support growth initiatives, repositioning of facilities which have been temporarily idled, and amounts related to specific non-recurring items such as legal settlements. We also contributed 20.0 million to the Smart and Safe Florida campaign during 2022. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 119.4 million, an increase of 72.1 million, or 153 , from 47.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The overall increase in depreciation and amortization expense is due to increased depreciation from acquired facilities, and increased amortization related to acquired licenses and other intangibles, from the investment in infrastructure for additional dispensaries and cultivation facilities. 
 Impairment and Disposal of Long-lived Assets, Net 
 Loss on impairment and disposal of long-lived assets for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 75.5 million an increase of 70.2 million as compared to 5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the current period is primarily due to exited facilities and the repositioning of assets, primarily in our Southeast hub. The prior year primarily consisted of the write-off of certain licenses in our Southwest hub due to market changes and the disposal of certain long-lived assets. 
 Other Expense, Net 
 Total other expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 75.8 million, an increase of 42.3 million or 126 , from 33.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily the result of an increase in interest expense related to additional private placement notes, notes payable, and finance leases to support business growth and loss on disposal of non-operational assets in the Northeast and Southeast as the Company continues to streamline its operations. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 161.8 million an increase of 15.1 million from 146.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Provision for income taxes as a percentage of revenue decreased from 16 to 13 . Under IRC Section 280E, cannabis companies are only allowed to deduct expenses that are directly related to production of the products. During the third quarter of the 2022, the Company adopted a more favorable tax position with respect to intercompany management fees based on an IRS position taken in audit of a similar businesses. The increase in income tax expense is primarily due to the increase in gross profit as a result of increased revenue, partially offset by the more favorable tax position on intercompany management fees. 
 Net (Loss) Income from Continuing Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income 
 Net loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 205.2 million, a decrease of 224.5 million from net income from continuing operations of 19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. A significant factor in the decrease in net income is the Company's repositioning and continued work to streamline our cultivation and production facilities 
 56 

and the markets in which we operate. This resulted in a loss on disposal of long-lived assets and non-operating assets of 75.5 million. The Company expects to continue to incur such costs in the near-term as we continue to focus on streamlining our business and the markets in which we operate or may enter into. The increase to sales and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, and interest expense, as described above, were also factors in the decreased net income. 
 Net Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax Benefit 
 Net loss from discontinued operations, net of tax benefit, for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 47.6 million an increase of 45.6 million from net loss from discontinued operations of 1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily the result of our continued efforts to reposition assets and streamline operations which resulted in a one-time impairment of long-lived assets related to discontinued operations of 49.1 million, primarily consisting of a license and facility lease and related assets.

Revenue, Net 
 
 Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, was 938.0 million, an increase of 416.5 million or 80 from 521.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in revenue is primarily the result of increased locations, increased or new wholesale operations in specific markets, organic growth in retail sales due to an increase in products available for purchase, and acquisitions, most notably the acquisition of Harvest Health Recreation, Inc. Harvest in October 2021. 
 57 

Cost of Goods Sold 
 
 Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2021, was 370.2 million, an increase of 235.1 million or 174 from 135.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily in correlation with the increase in revenue. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue increased from 26 for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 40 for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to our inventory step-up related to acquisitions, increased wholesale business which is generally lower margin than retail sales, increased depreciation related to capital expenditures in cultivation and processing to support business growth and expansion into new markets which are not fully vertical, resulting in the sale of third party products, and therefore yield lower margin than the Florida vertical market. 
 Gross Profit 
 
 Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2021, was 567.8 million, an increase of 181.4 million or 47 from 386.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of an increase in retail sales due to an increase in the number of dispensaries and customer count. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from 74 for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 61 , for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease is caused by inventory step-up related to acquisitions, increased wholesale business, which is generally lower margin than retail sales, increased depreciation related to capital expenditures in cultivation and processing to support business growth, expansion into new markets which are not fully vertical and therefore yield lower margin than the Florida vertical market and macro-economic factors centered around prices and labor. 
 Sales and Marketing Expense 
 
 Sales and marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, was 215.1 million an increase of 95.7 million, or 80 from 119.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in sales and marketing is the result of a higher headcount for the year, as we continue to add additional dispensaries in efforts to maintain and further drive higher growth in sales and market share. This increased headcount resulted in higher personnel costs, which is the primary driver for the increase year over year. 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 
 General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, was 100.5 million an increase 64.5 million or 179 from 36.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in general and administrative expense is primarily the result of significant expenses incurred to acquire and integrate new subsidiaries, most notably Harvest and entering new markets and ramping up our infrastructure. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, was 47.2 million, an increase of 34.6 million, or 275 from 12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The overall increase in depreciation and amortization expenses was due to amortization of intangibles acquired and fair valued in acquisitions, and investment in infrastructure that resulted in more capitalized assets from additional dispensaries. Furthermore, depreciation expense increased due to additional finance leases added. 
 Impairment and Disposal of Long-lived Assets 
 
 Loss on impairment and disposal of long-lived assets for the year ended December 31, 2021, was 5.4 million an increase of 5.3 million from 0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to the write off of certain licenses in the Southwest due to market changes and the disposal of certain long-lived assets. 
 Other Expense, Net 
 
 Total other expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2021, was 33.5 million, a decrease of 27.4 million, or 45 , from 60.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The overall decrease is primarily driven by 42.7 million of other expense due to revaluation of warrants, offset by increased interest expense due to additional financings. 
 
 On December 10, 2020, the Company entered into a Supplemental Warrant Indenture with Odyssey Trust Company pursuant to which it amended the terms of the issued and outstanding subordinate voting share purchase warrants of the Company (the Public Warrants to convert the exercise price of the Public Warrants to 13.47 per share, the U.S. dollar equivalent of the Canadian dollar exercise price of the Public Warrants of C 17.25. As a result of this, the Public Warrants converted to equity and eliminated the necessity of revaluation expense on these warrants. The Company did acquire Canadian dollar warrants in the acquisition of Harvest and recorded income related to the revaluation of these warrants in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 58 

Additionally, interest expense increased as a result of new debt to support business growth, additional finance leases and additional construction finance liabilities acquired in the Harvest acquisition. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 146.7 million an increase of 52.3 million from 94.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, due to an increase in gross profit of 181.4 million for the same period. Under IRC Section 280E, cannabis companies are only allowed to deduct expenses that are directly related to production of the products. The increase in income tax expense is due to the significant increase in gross profit as well as an increase in expenses with are not tax deductible under 280E. 
 Net Income and Comprehensive Income from Continuing Operations 
 
 Net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 19.4 million, a decrease of 43.6 million from 63.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in net income was driven primarily by an increase in revenue due to increased dispensary locations, expansion of wholesale business, and acquisitions that was offset by the increased cost of goods sold and income tax expenses due to 280E, as described above. In addition, increases in sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses such significant expenses incurred to acquire and integrate new subsidiaries, most notably Harvest, increases in personnel costs, dispensary expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, ramping infrastructure and go-forward compliance, all contributed to the offset in net income. 
 Net Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax Benefit 
 Net loss from discontinued operations, net of tax benefit, for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 1.9 million an increase of 1.9 million from zero for the year ended December 31, 2020, as there were no operations in the prior year 2020. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Since our inception, we have funded our operations and capital spending through cash flows from product sales, third-party debt, proceeds from the sale of our capital stock and loans from affiliates and entities controlled by our affiliates. We are generating cash from sales and are deploying our capital reserves to acquire and develop assets capable of producing additional revenues and earnings over both the immediate and near term to support our business growth and expansion. Our current principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents provided by our operations and debt and equity offerings. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks and money market funds. 
 Our primary uses of cash are for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service payments, income tax payments, and acquisitions. Additionally, from time to time, we may use capital for other investing and financing activities. Working capital is used principally for our personnel as well as costs related to the growth, manufacture and production of our products. Our capital expenditures consist primarily of additional facilities and dispensaries, and improvements to existing facilities. Our debt service payments consist primarily of interest payments. Income tax payments are mainly represented by federal income tax payments due to IRC Section 280E. Acquisitions consist of expanding the cultivation and dispensary footprint. 
 59 

Cash and cash equivalents were 212.3 million as of December 31, 2022. We believe our existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements from the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K through at least the next 12 months. Any additional future requirements will be funded through the following sources of capital: 
 Cash from ongoing operations, 

Market offerings - the Company has the ability to offer equity in the market for significant potential proceeds, as evidenced by previous recent private placements, 

Debt - the Company has the ability to obtain additional debt from additional creditors, 

Exercise of share-based awards - the Company may receive funds from exercise of options and warrants from the holders of such securities. 

Cash Flows 
 
 The consolidated statements of cash flows include continuing operations and discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. There were no discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. The table below highlights our cash flows for the periods indicated.

Cash Flow from Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 10.2 million, compared to 12.9 million net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021. This is primarily due to favorable changes in working capital, including the timing of income tax payments that were offset by increases in inventory. 
 Cash Flow from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 215.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of 0.1 million, compared to the 215.2 million net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is mainly due to the decrease of property and equipment purchases offset by cash provided by the Harvest acquisition. 
 Cash Flow from Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 177.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of 111.4 million, compared to the 289.2 million net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is primarily related to a decrease in proceeds from borrowings compared to the prior year. 
 Balance Sheet Exposure 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, 100 of our balance sheet is exposed to U.S. cannabis-related activities. We believe our operations are in material compliance with all applicable state and local laws, regulations and licensing requirements in the states in which we operate. However, cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law. Substantially all our revenue is derived from U.S. cannabis operations. For information about risks related to U.S. cannabis operations, please refer to the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on the results of operations or financial condition of, including, and without limitation, such considerations as liquidity and capital resources. 
 Critical accounting policies and estimates 
 
 Critical accounting estimates 
 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised. 
 Significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements are described below. See Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. 
 Inventory 
 The net realizable value of inventories represents the estimated selling price for inventories in the ordinary course of business, less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale. The determination of net realizable value requires significant judgment, including consideration of factors such as shrinkage, the aging of and future demand for inventory, expected future selling price, what we expect to realize by selling the inventory and the contractual arrangements with customers. Reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are based upon quantities on hand, projected volumes from demand forecasts and net realizable value. The estimates are judgmental in nature and are made at a point in time, using available information, expected business plans and expected market conditions. As a result, the actual amount received on sale could differ from the estimated value of inventory. Periodic reviews are performed on the inventory balance. The impact of changes in inventory reserves is reflected in cost of goods sold. 
 Estimated Useful Lives and Depreciation and Amortization of Property and Equipment and Intangible Assets 
 Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets are dependent upon estimates of useful lives, which are determined through the exercise of judgment. The assessment of any impairment of these assets is dependent upon estimates of recoverable amounts that take into account factors such as economic and market conditions and the useful lives of assets. 
 61 

Accounting for Acquisitions and Business Combinations 
 Classification of an acquisition as a business combination or an asset acquisition depends on whether the assets acquired constitute a business, which can be a complex judgment. Whether an acquisition is classified as a business combination or asset acquisition can have a significant impact on the entries made on and after acquisition. 
 In determining the fair value of all identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, the most significant estimates relate to contingent consideration and intangible assets. Management exercises judgement in estimating the probability and timing of when earn-outs are expected to be achieved, which is used as the basis for estimating fair value. For any intangible asset identified, depending on the type of intangible asset and the complexity of determining its fair value, an independent valuation expert or management may develop the fair value, using appropriate valuation techniques, which are generally based on a forecast of the total expected future net cash flows. 
 Cannabis licenses are the primary intangible asset acquired in business combinations as they provide the Company the ability to operate in each market. However, some cannabis licenses are subject to renewal and therefore there is some risk of non-renewal for several reasons, including operational, regulatory, legal or economic. To appropriately consider the risk of non-renewal, the Company applies probability weighting to the expected future net cash flows in calculating the fair value of these intangible assets. The key assumptions used in these cash flow projections include discount rates and terminal growth rates. Of the key assumptions used, the impact of the estimated fair value of the intangible assets has the greatest sensitivity to the estimated discount rate used in the valuation. The terminal growth rate represents the rate at which these businesses will continue to grow into perpetuity. Other significant assumptions include revenue, gross profit, operating expenses and anticipated capital expenditures which are based upon the Corporation s historical operations along with management projections. 
 The evaluations are linked closely to the assumptions made by management regarding the future performance of these assets and any changes in the discount rate applied. 
 Income Taxes 
 The Company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on enacted tax rates and laws for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As the Company operates in the cannabis industry, it is subject to the limits of IRC Section 280E under which the Company is only allowed to deduct expenses directly related to the cost of producing the products or cost of production. 
 The Company recognizes uncertain income tax positions at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained. Recognition or measurement is reflected in the period in which the likelihood changes. 
 Long-lived Asset Impairment Assessment 
 The Company reviews long-lived assets, including property and equipment, definite life intangible assets, and right-of-use assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Factors which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy of the business, a significant decrease in the market value of the assets or significant negative industry or economic trends. In accordance with ASC 360-10, when evaluating long-lived assets with impairment indicators for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to its estimated undiscounted cash flows. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value, which is typically based on estimated discounted future cash flows. We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value. 
 Goodwill Impairment Assessment 
 Goodwill is allocated at the date the goodwill is initially recorded. We conclude we operate one operating segment and reporting unit evaluating goodwill for impairment as one singular reporting unit. We evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter or earlier upon the occurrence of substantive unfavorable changes in economic conditions, industry trends, costs, cash flows, or ongoing declines in market capitalization. The Company applies the guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU 2011-08 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Testing Goodwill for Impairment, which provides entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment (commonly referred to as Step Zero to determine whether further quantitative analysis for impairment of goodwill is necessary. In performing Step Zero for the Company s 
 62 

goodwill impairment test, the Company is required to make assumptions and judgments including but not limited to the following: the evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as related to the Company s business, industry and market trends, and the overall future financial performance of its reporting units and future opportunities in the markets in which they operate. If impairment indicators are present after performing Step Zero, the Company would perform a quantitative impairment analysis to estimate the fair value of goodwill. 
 The quantitative impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets, liabilities, and goodwill to reporting units, and the determination of fair value of each reporting unit. The impairment test requires the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying amount, including goodwill. If the Company would conclude a quantitative impairment test is required, the Company would review fair value techniques for the most appropriate technique generally applying the income approach by using discounted cash flow DCF analyses. Determining fair value requires the Company to make judgments about appropriate forecasted revenue and related revenue growth rate, the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA margins rate and the weighted average cost of capital. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based the budget of the reporting unit, long-term business plan and recent operating performance. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the reporting unit and market conditions. Given the inherent uncertainty in determining the assumptions underlying a DCF analysis, actual results may differ from those used in our valuations. The reporting unit may be at risk of failing the quantitative impairment test if it had a fair value that is not substantially in excess of the carrying amount at the assessment date. 
 At the time of our assessment, the Company s share price had declined affecting the Company s market capitalization. This is considered a risk indicator for goodwill impairment. In assessing the reasonableness of the Company s fair value, we reconciled the Company's market capitalization to the aggregate determined fair value of the Company, which, as of December 31, 2022, included a control premium. In order to determine the control premium, the Company assessed transactions of comparable multi-state operators in the cannabis industry. We determined the control premium was in line with other comparable transactions. The resulting fair value of the Company, including control premium, exceeded its carrying value. Therefore, management has concluded the market capitalization as of December 31, 2022 was not a triggering event that would require the Company to perform a quantitative assessment of goodwill. 
 Management will continue to monitor the Company s market capitalization and estimated control premium for changes that could impact recoverability of goodwill. The recoverability of goodwill is dependent upon the continued growth of cash flows from our business activities. If the Company s market capitalization continues to decline for a longer sustained period, there is additional risk that goodwill impairment could occur. 
 
 Share-Based Payment Arrangements 
 We use the Black-Scholes pricing model to determine the fair value of options and warrants granted to employees and directors under share-based payment arrangements, where appropriate. In estimating fair value, management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates such as the expected life of units, volatility of future share price, risk free rates, and future dividend yields at the initial grant date. Changes in assumptions used to estimate fair value could result in materially different results. 
 Commitments and Contingencies 
 From time to time, the Company may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of operations in the normal course of business. Periodically, the Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses the potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reliably estimated, such amount is recognized in contingencies. Contingent liabilities are measured at management s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. The Company performs evaluations to identify onerous contracts and, where applicable, records contingent liabilities for such contracts. 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 The Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company uses judgment to select the methods used to make certain assumptions and in performing the fair value calculations in order to determine (a) the values attributed to each component of a transaction at the time of their issuance; (b) the fair value measurements for certain instruments that require subsequent measurement at fair value on a recurring basis; and (c) for disclosing the fair value of financial instruments. These valuation estimates could be significantly 
 63 

different because of the use of judgment and the inherent uncertainty in estimating the fair value of these instruments that are not quoted in an active market. 
 Critical accounting policies 
 Inventory 
 Our inventories primarily consist of raw materials, work in process, and finished goods. Costs incurred during the growing and production process are capitalized as incurred to the extent that cost is less than net realizable value. The costs include materials, labor and manufacturing overhead used in the growing and production processes. Pre-harvest costs are capitalized. Our inventory of purchased finished goods and packing materials are initially valued at cost and subsequently at the lower of cost and net realizable value. 
 Leases 
 ASC Topic 842 is a standard that requires lessees to increase transparency and comparability among organization by requiring the recognition of Right of Use Assets ROU assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The requirements of this standard include a significant increase in required disclosures to meet the objectives of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 We recognize revenue in accordance with ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Through our application of the standard, we recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration of which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. Revenues consist of retail and wholesale sales of cannabis and cannabis related products, which are recognized when control of the goods has transferred to the customer and collectability is reasonably assured. This is generally when goods have been delivered, which is also when the performance obligation has been fulfilled under the terms of the related sales contract. 
 Share Based Compensation 
 We account for share-based compensation expense in accordance with FASB ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation, which requires the measurement and recognition of share-based compensation expense based on estimated fair values, for all stock-based payment awards made to employees. We measure the share-based payment awards based on its estimated fair value of the awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the fair value of the Company s common stock on the date of grant, for the warrants and options. We measure the share-based payment awards based on its estimated fair value of the awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for warrants and options, and the fair value of the Company s common stock on the date of grant for restricted stock awards RSUs ). 
 Acquisitions 
 We account for business combinations using the acquisition method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 805, Business Combinations which requires recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent assets and liabilities, at their respective fair values on the date of acquisition. 
 Contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in a business combination. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates, with the corresponding gain or loss recognized within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. 
 Non-controlling interests in the acquiree are measured at fair value on acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are recognized as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received. 
 Loans acquired in business combinations are initially recorded at fair value, which includes an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans and, therefore, no corresponding allowance for loan losses is recorded for such loans at acquisition. 
 Purchase price allocations may be preliminary and, during the measurement period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, changes in assumptions and estimates that result in adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded in the period the adjustments are determined.

Cannabis licenses are the primary intangible asset acquired in business combinations as they provide the Company the ability to operate in each market. However, some cannabis licenses are subject to renewal and therefore there is some risk of non-renewal for several reasons, including operational, regulatory, legal or economic. To appropriately consider the risk of non-renewal, the Company applies probability weighting to the expected future net cash flows in calculating the fair value of these intangible assets. The key assumptions used in these cash flow projections include discount rates and terminal growth rates. Of the key assumptions used, the impact of the estimated fair value of the intangible assets has the greatest sensitivity to the discount rate used in the valuation. The terminal growth rate represents the rate at which these businesses are expected to grow into perpetuity. Other significant assumptions include revenue, gross profit, operating expenses and anticipated capital expenditures which are based upon the Corporation s historical operations along with management projections. The evaluations are linked closely to the assumptions made by management regarding the future performance of these assets and any changes in the discount rate applied. 
 Financial Instruments 
 We apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities that are required to be recorded at fair value, we consider all related factors of the asset by market participants in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and credit risk. 
 Management s Use of Non-GAAP Measures 
 Our management uses a financial measure that is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or GAAP, in addition to financial measures in accordance with GAAP to evaluate our operating results. This non-GAAP financial measure should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, our reported financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not defined under GAAP. Our management uses this non-GAAP financial measure and believes it enhances an investor s understanding of our financial and operating performance from period to period because it excludes certain material non-cash items and certain other adjustments management believes are not reflective of our ongoing operations and performance. Adjusted EBITDA excludes from net income as reported interest, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization to arrive at EBITDA. This is then adjusted for items that do not represent the operations of the core business such as inventory step-up for fair value adjustments in purchase accounting, integration and transition costs, acquisition and transaction costs, other non-recurring costs such as contributions to specific initiative campaigns (such as Smart and Safe Florida), expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic, impairments and disposals of long-lived assets, the results of entities consolidated as variable interest entities VIEs but not legally controlled and operated by the Company, discontinued operations, and other income and expense items. Integration and transition costs include those costs related to integration of acquired entities and to transition major systems or processes. Acquisition and transaction costs relate to specific transactions such as acquisitions whether contemplated or completed and regulatory filings and costs related to equity and debt issuances. Other non-recurring costs includes miscellaneous items which are not expected to reoccur frequently such as inventory adjustments related to specific issues and unusual litigation. Adjusted EBITDA for the period ended December 31, 2021, has been adjusted to reflect this current definition and to conform with the current period presentation. 
 Trulieve reports Adjusted EBITDA to help investors assess the operating performance of the Company s business. The financial measures noted above are metrics that have been adjusted from the GAAP net income measure in an effort to provide readers with a normalized metric in making comparisons more meaningful across the cannabis industry, as well as to remove non-recurring, irregular and one-time items that may otherwise distort the GAAP net income measure. 
 As noted above, our Adjusted EBITDA is not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted EBITDA rather than net income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Because of these limitations, we consider, and you should consider, Adjusted EBITDA together with other operating and financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA from net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, has been included herein immediately following our discussion of Adjusted EBITDA .

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Market Risk 
 Strategic and operational risks arise if we fail to carry out business operations and/or to raise sufficient equity and/or debt financing. These strategic opportunities or threats arise from a range of factors that might include changing economic and political circumstances and regulatory approvals and competitor actions. The risk is mitigated by consideration of other potential development opportunities and challenges which management may undertake. 
 Currency Risk 
 Our operating results and financial position are reported in U.S. dollars. Some of our financial transactions are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The results of operations are subject to currency transaction risks. 
 We have no hedging agreements in place with respect to foreign exchange rates. We have not entered into any agreements or purchased any instruments to hedge possible currency risks at this time. 
 Credit Risk 
 Management does not believe that the Company has credit risk related to its customers, as the Company s revenue is generated primarily through cash transactions. The Company deals almost entirely with on demand sales and does not have any material 
 66 

wholesale agreements as of December 31, 2022. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to our cash and cash equivalents are limited primarily to amounts held with financial institutions. 
 Liquidity Risk 
 Liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our financial obligations associated with financial liabilities. We manage liquidity risk through the management of our capital structure. Our approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that we will have sufficient liquidity to settle obligations and liabilities when due. 
 Asset forfeiture risk 
 Because the cannabis industry remains illegal under U.S. federal law, any property owned by participants in the cannabis industry which are either used in the course of conducting such business, or are the proceeds of such business, could be subject to seizure by law enforcement and subsequent civil asset forfeiture. Even if the owner of the property were never charged with a crime, the property in question could still be seized and subject to an administrative proceeding by which, with minimal due process, it could be subject to forfeiture. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates. Our debt exposes us to risk of fluctuations in interest rates. Fixed rate debt, where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument, exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates. Floating rate debt, where the interest rate fluctuates periodically, exposes us to short-term changes in market interest rates. We manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired proportion of fixed and floating rate debts and may employ interest rate swaps Swaps as a tool from time to time to achieve that position. To manage our interest rate risk exposure, we entered into one Swap contract during the year ended December 31, 2022, to hedge the floating rate term loans. Changes in market interest rates impact the fair value of our Swap contract the balance of which is 2.5 million as of December 31, 2022. See Note 11. Notes Payable to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 
 In addition to our private placement notes payable and long-term debt, we also have lease obligations and construction finance liabilities that bare interest. Interest rates on existing leases and construction finance liabilities typically do not change unless there is a modification to an underlying agreement. 
 See Item 7, Liquidity and Capital Resources , for additional information. 
 Concentration Risk 
 Our operations are substantially located in Florida and to a lesser extent Arizona and Pennsylvania. Should economic conditions deteriorate, or competitive pressure intensify within that region, our results of operations and financial position would be negatively impacted. 
 General Economic Risk 
 Our operations could be affected by the economic context should the unemployment level, interest rates or inflation reach levels that influence consumer trends and spending and, consequently, impact our sales and profitability. 
 Banking Risk 
 Notwithstanding that a majority of states have legalized medical marijuana, there has been no change in U.S. federal banking laws related to the deposit and holding of funds derived from activities related to the marijuana industry. Given that U.S. federal law provides that the production and possession of cannabis is illegal, there is a strong argument that banks cannot accept for deposit funds from businesses involved with the marijuana industry. Consequently, businesses involved in the marijuana industry often have difficulty accessing the U.S. banking system and traditional financing sources. The inability to open bank accounts with certain institutions may make it difficult to operate the businesses of Trulieve, its subsidiaries and investee companies, and leaves their cash holdings vulnerable. We have banking relationships in all jurisdictions in which we operate. 
 Inflation Risk 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, inflation in the United States has accelerated and is currently expected to continue at an elevated level for the near-term. Rising inflation could have an adverse impact on expenses, as these costs could increase at a 
 67 

higher rate than revenues. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in the prices of raw product and packaging materials and the costs of labor, transportation and energy. Inflation pressures could also result in increases in these input costs. Therefore, our business results depend, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. Failure to manage these fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows. In addition, unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, such as a recession or continued slowed economic growth, could negatively affect consumer demand for cannabis products, which consequently, may negatively affect the results of operations. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of cannabis products, negatively impacting our net sales and margins. Softer consumer demand for cannabis products could reduce our profitability and could negatively affect our overall financial performance. 
 Financial Instruments and Financial Risk Management 
 We are exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks. The board of directors of Trulieve mitigate these risks by assessing, monitoring and approving the risk management processes. 
 The Company s financial instruments that are measured at fair valued on a recurring basis consist of money market funds, an interest rate swap, and a warrant liability. Our financial instruments where carrying value approximates the fair value include cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, notes payable, notes payable related party, operating lease liability, finance lease liability, other long-term liabilities and construction finance liability. Financial instruments recorded at fair value are classified using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs to fair value measurements. The three levels of hierarchy are: 

Level 1: 
 
 Observable inputs based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 

Level 2: 
 
 Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets, which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and 

Level 3: 
 
 Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.

 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 
 Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the risk related to controls and procedures. 
 In connection with the preparation of this Form 10-K, as of December 31, 2022, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that as of December 31, 2022, we did not maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures because of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below under the caption Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

 As of December 31, 2022, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on the foregoing evaluation, our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective because of the material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting discussed below, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 We consolidated variable interest entities as of December 31, 2022, because we determined we were the primary beneficiary. We have elected to exclude our variable interest entities from the scope of our report on internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The financial position of our variable interest entities represented an insignificant amount of our total assets, net revenues, and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the following material weaknesses have been identified: 
 Information technology general controls (ITGCs) were not designed and operating effectively to ensure (i) that access to applications and data, and the ability to make program and job changes, were adequately restricted to appropriate personnel and (ii) that the activities of individuals with access to modify data and make program and job changes were appropriately monitored. Business process controls (automated and manual) that are dependent on the affected ITGCs were also deemed ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted; 

Ineffective design, implementation, and documentation of management review controls related to the valuation of inventory; 

Ineffective design of controls to identify and evaluate the existence of, and accounting for, variable interest entities. The relevant accounting literature governing variable interest entities is highly complex and requires the exercise of significant judgment in determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity and whether that variable interest entity should be consolidated. 

While the control deficiencies did not result in a material misstatement to the Company s consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2022, they did represent material weaknesses as of December 31, 2022, since there existed a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 Attestation Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 Marcum LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, which report follows below. 
 Management s Remediation Measures 
 Management is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. In response to the identified material weakness in the overall control environment, management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, has taken a number of remediation actions during the year ended December 31, 2022, and are continuing our actions. Remediation actions taken during the year are outlined below. 
 
 Information technology: 
 The Company has designed and is the process of designing and implementing improved or additional controls over access, change management, and IT operations to ensure that access rights are restricted to appropriate individuals, and that data integrity is maintained via effective change management controls over system updates and the transfer of data between systems. 

The Company continues to adjust its Enterprise Resource Planning ERP Systems to work towards improvement and automation of ITGC s as well as other business process application controls. 

69 

The Company is enhancing procedures to validate the information produced by the entity and end user computing to compensate while the ITGC controls are being improved. 

Inventory Valuation: 
 The Company continues to adjust its ERP Systems to work towards increasing the level of automation in inventory tracking and analysis and reducing manual processes. 

Hiring additional qualified personnel to provide additional oversight around the inventory valuation process. 

Adding additional and more robust management review controls to provide more focus on detailed analyses and enhanced monitoring of our inventory valuation policies and process. 

Variable Interest Entities: 
 The Company is enhancing procedures around the identification and evaluation, and where applicable, remeasurement, of our variable interest entities and potential variable interest entities. 

Reviewing business processes surrounding non-routine transactions and other complex financial reporting areas to identify and implement enhanced procedures related to internal controls. 

Beginning in fiscal year 2022, the Company consolidated the identified variable interest entity that was previously not consolidated. The consolidated financial statements for prior periods were not and will not be modified in the current or future Annual Reports as such errors are immaterial to those periods. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Except for the material weaknesses and the remediation efforts described above, no other change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Trulieve Cannabis Corp.(the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We also audited the adjustments described in Note 2 that were applied to revise the 2020 financial statements and reflect the change in accounting principle related to accounting for income taxes. In our opinion, such adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. We were not engaged to audit, review or apply any procedures to the 2020 financial statements of the Company other than with respect to the adjustments and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or other form of assurance on the 2020 financial statements taken as a whole. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013 and our report dated March 8, 2023, expressed an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting because of the existence of material weaknesses. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Change in Accounting Principle 
 As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has elected to change its method of accounting for deferred tax assets and liabilities in acquisitions. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Valuation of Inventory 
 As described in Note 7, to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s consolidated inventory related to cannabis inventory is 297.8 million. As discussed in Note 3, the Company s inventory consists of cannabis plants, work in process and manufactured and purchased finished goods and is valued at cost and subsequently at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Significant inputs 
 F- 2 

and assumptions used in the valuation of inventory (excluding purchased finished goods) include attrition rates of plants, average yield per plant, cumulative stage of completion in the production process and allocation of cost of goods sold. In addition, the Company records a provision for slow-moving and obsolete inventory, which can involve a high degree of judgment. The Company periodically reviews its inventory and identifies that which is excess, slow moving and obsolete by considering factors such as inventory levels, expected product life and forecasted sales demand. 
 We identified the valuation of inventory as a critical audit matter because of the significance of this balance sheet item, the significant assumptions management makes with regards to its valuation of inventory and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management s assumptions and estimates. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing the procedures and evaluating audit evidence, in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements Our procedures related to the valuation of inventory included, among others: 
 We obtained an understanding and evaluated the design of the internal controls over management s valuation of inventory 

We evaluated the significant assumptions stated above and the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in management s costing and valuation 

Testing of attrition rates, average yield and cumulative stage of completion involved performing physical observations of the growing cannabis and assessing quantities and growth stage as compared to the plants life cycle 

Testing of harvest and extraction yields involved performing physical observations of each process. 

Testing of managements assumptions related to costs of goods sold, sales price and expected yields involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering(i) historical actual information (ii) independent calculations and observations of these inputs (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit 

We evaluated management s provision for slow-moving and obsolete inventory calculation, by reviewing inputs, including historical sales activity versus on-hand inventory levels, we reviewed current selling prices versus current cost 

Evaluation of Impairment Assessment 
 As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company tests goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired. The Company performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it was more-likely-than-not if the reporting unit s carrying value is less than the fair value, indicating the potential for goodwill impairment. A number of factors, including historical results, business plans, forecasts, market data, and a reasonable control premium were considered in the evaluation of the fair value of the reporting unit. Changes in the conditions for these judgments and estimates can significantly affect the assessed value of goodwill. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including property and equipment, definite life intangible assets, and right-of-use assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Factors which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy of the business, a significant decrease in the market value of the assets or significant negative industry or economic trends. 
 Auditing management s impairment assessment is complex due to the judgments and assumptions required to evaluate management s considerations of those factors identified above. Auditing these assumptions involved extensive audit effort, including the need to involve our valuation specialists, due to the complexity of these assumptions and a high degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures and evaluating the results of those procedures. 
 The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: 
 We obtained an understanding and evaluated the design of the internal controls over management s annual impairment assessment, including controls addressing: 

o Management s assessment of potential triggering events indicating potential impairment 

o Management s assessment of qualitative factors that may indicate potential impairment 

Substantively tested the appropriateness of the judgments and assumptions used by management in conducting its impairment analysis, including: 

Goodwill 
 F- 3 

o Evaluated management s qualitative assessment by comparing the relevant factors to current industry, market and economic trends, to the Company's historical results, third party industry outlook reports and other relevant data 

o With the assistance of valuation specialists, performed an assessment of the Company s comparison of its market capitalization to the carrying value of the reporting unit by comparing the implied control premium to a range of control premiums determined from publicly available data 

Long-lived assets 
 o Evaluated the factors management considered in its conclusion on triggering events and where triggering events were identified on a state-by-state basis. Factors evaluated included historical or projected future operating results and cash flows, significant changes in use of the assets or business strategy, or significant negative industry or economic trends. 

o Tested the Company s historical state-by-state cash flows performed in its triggering events analysis and agreed the underlying data and management s conclusions to evidence obtained in other areas of our audit. 

o Tested the Company's estimate of undiscounted cash flows from its Massachusetts long-lived assets including, among other procedures, evaluating the significant assumptions used, testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data, performing sensitivity analyses, and evaluating the appropriateness of the conclusion of no resulting impairment.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING 
 ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 
 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 
 Trulieve Cannabis Corp. 
 
 Adverse Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited Trulieve Cannabis Corp. s (the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses described in the following paragraph on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting : 
 Information technology general controls (ITGCs) were not designed and operating effectively to ensure (i) that access to applications and data, and the ability to make program and job changes, were adequately restricted to appropriate personnel and (ii) that the activities of individuals with access to modify data and make program and job changes were appropriately monitored. Business process controls (automated and manual) that are dependent on the affected ITGCs were also deemed ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted; 
 Ineffective design, implementation, and documentation of management review controls related to the valuation of inventory; 
 Ineffective design of controls to identify and evaluate the existence of, and accounting for, variable interest entities. 
 These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the fiscal December 31, 2022 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 8, 2023 on those consolidated financial statements. 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, and related notes of the Company, and our report dated March 8, 2023expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
 F- 5 

accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of the inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company capitalizes interest on debt financing invested in projects under construction. Upon the asset becoming available for use, capitalized interest costs, as a portion of the total cost of the asset, are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related asset. The Company classifies assets as held for sale and ceases depreciation of the assets when there is a plan for disposal of the assets and those assets meet the held for sale criteria. Gains or losses on disposal of an item are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of the item and recognized within the statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. Construction in progress is transferred when available for use and depreciation of the assets commences at that point. The Company reviews properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable.

Revenues consist of retail and wholesale sales, which are recognized when control of the goods has transferred to the customer and collectability is reasonably assured. This is generally when goods have been delivered, which is also when the performance obligation has been fulfilled under the terms of the related sales contract.

 Loans acquired in business combinations are initially recorded at fair value, which includes an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans and, therefore, corresponding allowance for loan losses is recorded for such loans at acquisition. Purchase price allocations may be preliminary and, during the measurement period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, changes in assumptions and estimates that result in adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded in the period the adjustments are determined. Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred for the acquisition of subsidiaries over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Cannabis licenses are the primary intangible asset acquired in business combinations as they provide the Company the ability to operate in each market. However, some cannabis licenses are subject to renewal and therefore there is some risk of non-renewal for several reasons, including operational, regulatory, legal, or economic. To appropriately consider the risk of non-renewal, the Company applies probability weighting to the expected future net cash flows in calculating the fair value of these intangible assets. The key assumptions used in these cash flow projections include discount rates and terminal growth rates. Of the key assumptions used, the impact of the estimated fair value of the intangible assets has the greatest sensitivity to the estimated discount rate used in the valuation. The terminal growth rate represents the rate at which these businesses will continue to grow into perpetuity. Other significant assumptions include revenue, gross profit, operating expenses, and anticipated capital expenditures which are based upon the Corporation s historical operations along with management projections. The evaluations are linked closely to the assumptions made by management regarding the future performance of these assets and any changes in the discount rate applied. 

Macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; Industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which the company operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics (considered in both absolute terms and relative to peers), a change in the market for the company's products or services, or a regulatory or political development; Cost factors such as increases in inventory, labor, or other costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows; Overall financial performance such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods; Other relevant entity-specific events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy, or customers, contemplation of bankruptcy, or litigation; Events affecting a reporting unit such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets, a more likely than not expectation of selling or disposing all, or a portion, of a reporting unit, the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit, or recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit; and A sustained decrease in share price (considered in both absolute terms and relative to peers). In order to determine that the value of goodwill may have been impaired, the Company applies the guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU 2011-08 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Testing Goodwill for Impairment, which provides entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment (commonly referred to as Step Zero to determine whether further quantitative analysis for impairment of goodwill is necessary. The Company performs the Step Zero assessment to determine that it was more-likely-than-not if the reporting unit s carrying value is less than the fair value, indicating the potential for goodwill impairment. A number of factors, including historical results, business plans, forecasts, market data, and a reasonable control premium are used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. Changes in the conditions for these judgments and estimates can significantly affect the assessed value of goodwill. The Company operates as operating segment and reporting unit and therefore, evaluates goodwill for impairment as one singular reporting unit annually during the fourth quarter or more often when an event occurs, or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For the 2022 impairment test, the Company considered the events and circumstances listed above identifying one event as a risk indicator for goodwill impairment, which is the decline in the Company s share price negatively affecting the Company s market capitalization. To assess this risk the Company further reviewed the fair value of the Company, including control premium, concluding the fair value of the Company exceeded its carrying value. The Company determined the control premium was in line with other comparable transactions. Therefore, the Company concluded the market capitalization as of the annual test was not a triggering event that would require the Company to perform a quantitative assessment of goodwill. Therefore, the Company did t identify any impairment of its goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, or 2020. Management will continue to monitor the Company s market capitalization and estimated control premium for changes that could impact recoverability of goodwill. The recoverability of goodwill is dependent upon the continued growth of cash flows from our business activities. If the Company s market capitalization continues to decline, for a longer sustained period, there is additional risk that goodwill impairment could occur.

The expected volatility was estimated by using the historical volatility of the Company. In cases where there is insufficient trading history, the expected volatility is estimated using the historical volatility of other companies that the Company considers comparable that have trading and volatility history prior to the Company becoming public. The expected life in years represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and is computed using the simplified method as the Company has insufficient historical information regarding its stock options to provide a basis for an estimate. The risk-free rate was based on the United States bond yield rate at the time of grant of the award. The expected annual rate of dividends is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur.

Realization of deferred tax assets associated with the net operating loss carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration. A valuation allowance to reflect management's estimate of the net operating loss carryforwards that may expire prior to their utilization has been recorded as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has million of non-capital Canadian losses which expire in and , million of state net operating losses which expire in - , and million of U.S. federal net operating losses which have an indefinite carryforward period. The Company determined a valuation allowance was applicable to million of non-Capital Canadian losses and million of state net operating losses. The Company also determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit from million of U.S. federal net operating losses and million of state net operating losses will not be realized and therefore this amount has not been recorded. As the Company operates in the cannabis industry, the Company is subject to the limits of Internal Revenue Code IRC Section 280E for U.S. federal income tax purposes as well as state income tax purposes for all states in which the Company operates except for Arizona, California, Colorado, and Massachusetts. Under IRC Section 280E, the Company is only allowed to deduct expenses directly related to costs of goods sold. This results in permanent differences between ordinary and necessary business expenses deemed non-allowable under IRC Section 280E. The Company recognizes benefits from uncertain tax positions based on the cumulative probability method whereby the largest benefit with a cumulative probability of greater than 50 is recorded. An uncertain tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained. As of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021 , the Company recorded an uncertain tax liability of million and million, respectively, inclusive of interest and penalties. Additionally, there are unrecognized deferred tax benefits of million as of December 31, 2022 , and million as of December 31, 2021. The Company does not reasonably expect the unrecognized tax benefits will materially increase or decrease within the next 12 months. During 2022, the Company recorded interest of million and penalties of million on uncertain tax liabilities within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. With few exceptions, as of December 31, 2022, the Company is no longer subject to ex amination by tax authorities for years before 2019.

The Company's VIEs are not material to the consolidated financial position or operations as of or for the year ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. The Company determined certain of these entities to be variable interest entities in which it is the primary beneficiary. The Company consolidates these entities due to the other holder s equity investment being insufficient to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support and the Company meeting the power and economics criteria. In particular, the Company controls the management decisions and activities most significant to certain VIEs, has provided a significant portion of the subordinated financial support provided to date, and holds membership interests exposing the Company to the risk of reward and/or loss. The Company allocates income and cash flows of the VIEs based on the outstanding ownership percentage in accordance with the underlying operating agreements, as amended. The Company has consolidated all identified variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

At each such meeting holders of Subordinate Voting Shares shall be entitled to one vote in respect of each Subordinate Voting Share held. 
 
 Alteration to Rights of Subordinate Voting Shares .

A special resolution means either (a) a resolution approved by two-thirds of the votes cast on the resolution at a properly called meeting of the shareholders, or (b) a resolution approved in writing by all of the shareholders holding shares that carry the right to vote on the matter at a shareholders meeting.

 Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding-Up . In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, whether voluntary or involuntary, or in the event of any other distribution of our assets among our shareholders for the purpose of winding up our affairs, the holders of Subordinate Voting Shares are, subject to the prior rights of the holders of any shares ranking in priority to the Subordinate Voting Shares, entitled to participate ratably along with all other holders of Multiple Voting Shares (on an as-converted to Subordinate Voting Share basis), Subordinate Voting Shares and Super Voting Shares (on an as-converted to Subordinate Voting Share basis). 
 
 Rights to Subscribe; Pre-Emptive Rights . Holders of Subordinate Voting Shares are not entitled to a right of first refusal to subscribe for, purchase or receive any part of any issue of Subordinate Voting Shares, or bonds, debentures or other securities now or in the future. 

Subdivision or Consolidation .

 Super Voting Shares 
 
 We have no Super Voting Shares outstanding. All of our outstanding Super Voting Shares automatically converted into Multiple Voting Shares on March 21, 2021 and, following that conversion, we may not issue additional Super Voting Shares. 
 
 Multiple Voting Shares 

Voting Rights . Holders of Multiple Voting Shares are entitled to notice of and to attend at any meeting of our shareholders, except a meeting of which only holders of another particular class or series of shares have the right to vote. At each such meeting, holders of Multiple Voting Shares are entitled to one vote in respect of each Subordinate Voting Share into which such Multiple Voting Share could ultimately then be converted (100 votes per Multiple Voting Share based on the current Conversion Ratio). 
 
 Alteration to Rights of Multiple Voting Shares . As long as any Multiple Voting Shares remain outstanding, we may not, without the consent of the holders of the Multiple Voting Shares by separate special resolution, prejudice or interfere with any special right attached to the Multiple Voting Shares. In connection with the exercise of the voting rights relating to any proposed alteration of rights, each holder of Multiple Voting Shares has one vote in respect of each Multiple Voting Share held. A special resolution means either (a) a resolution approved by two-thirds of the votes cast on the resolution at a properly called meeting of the shareholders, or (b) a resolution approved in writing by all of the shareholders holding shares that carry the right to vote on the matter at a shareholders meeting. Special rights and restrictions of the Multiple Voting Shares consist of the following special rights and restrictions included in Article 29 of the Articles and summarized herein: (i) Voting, (ii) Alteration to Rights of Multiple Voting Shares, (iii) Dividends, (iv) Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding-Up, (v) Rights to Subscribe; Pre-Emptive Rights and (vi) Conversion. 
 
 Dividends . Holders of Multiple Voting Shares have the right to receive dividends, out of any cash or other assets legally available therefor, pari passu (on an as converted basis, assuming conversion of all Multiple Voting Shares into Subordinate Voting Shares at the Conversion Ratio) as to dividends and any declaration or payment of any dividend on the Subordinate Voting Shares. No dividend may be declared or paid on the Multiple Voting Shares unless we simultaneously declare or pay, as applicable, equivalent dividends (on an as-converted to Subordinate Voting Share basis) on the Subordinate Voting Shares. 
 
 Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding-Up . In the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Trulieve, whether voluntary or involuntary, or in the event of any other distribution of our assets among our shareholders for the purpose of winding up our affairs, holders of Multiple Voting Shares, subject to the prior rights of the holders of any shares ranking in priority to the Multiple Voting Shares, are entitled to participate ratably along with all other holders of Multiple Voting Shares (on an as-converted to Subordinate Voting Share basis) and Subordinate Voting Shares. 
 
 Rights to Subscribe; Pre-Emptive Rights . Holders of Multiple Voting Shares are not entitled to a right of first refusal to subscribe for, purchase or receive any part of any issue of Subordinate Voting Shares, or bonds, debentures or other securities now or in the future. 
 
 Conversion . Subject to the Conversion Restrictions described below, holders of Multiple Voting Shares Holders have the following conversion rights: 
 
 (i) Right to Convert . Each Multiple Voting Share is convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, into such number of fully paid and non-assessable Subordinate Voting Shares as is determined by multiplying the number of Multiple Voting Shares by the Conversion Ratio applicable to such share in effect on the date the Multiple Voting Share is surrendered for conversion. The initial Conversion Ratio for Multiple Voting Shares is 100 Subordinate Voting Shares for each Multiple Voting Share, subject to adjustment as described below. 

(ii) Conversion Limitations . The Company is to use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain its status as a foreign private issuer (as determined in accordance with Rule 3b-4 under the Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Company shall not affect any conversion of Multiple Voting Shares, and holders of Multiple Voting Shares may not convert any portion of the Multiple Voting Shares to the extent that after giving effect to all permitted issuances after such conversions of Multiple Voting Shares, the aggregate number of Subordinate Voting Shares and Multiple Voting Shares held of record, directly or indirectly, by U.S. Residents would exceed 40 (the 40 Threshold of the aggregate number of Subordinate Voting Shares and Multiple Voting Shares issued and outstanding after giving effect to such conversions (the FPI Protective Restriction ); provided the board of directors may, by resolution, increase the 40 Threshold to an amount not to exceed 50 . We previously ceased to qualify as a foreign private issuer when the aggregate number of Subordinate Voting Shares and Multiple Voting Shares held of record, directly or indirectly, by U.S. Residents exceeded 50 of the aggregate number of Subordinate Voting Shares and Multiple Voting Shares issued and outstanding. Because the 40 Threshold has been exceeded and the Company ceased to qualify as a foreign private issuer, the Company s board of directors adopted a resolution in June 2020 permitting Multiple Voting Shares to convert into Subordinate Voting Shares at the election of each holder of Multiple Voting Shares. 

(iii) Mandatory Conversion . We may require each holder of Multiple Voting Shares to convert all, and not less than all, the Multiple Voting Shares at the applicable Conversion Ratio if at any time all the following conditions are satisfied (or otherwise waived by special resolution of holders of Multiple Voting Shares): 

(A) the Subordinate Voting Shares issuable upon conversion of all the Multiple Voting Shares are registered for resale and may be sold by the holder thereof pursuant to an effective registration statement and/or prospectus covering the Subordinate Voting Shares under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended; 

(B) the Company is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; and 

(C) the Subordinate Voting Shares are listed or quoted (and are not suspended from trading) on a recognized North American stock exchange or by way of reverse takeover transaction on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the TSX Venture Exchange, the CSE or Aequitas NEO Exchange (or any other stock exchange recognized as such by the Ontario Securities Commission). 

Because we are not registering for resale the Subordinate Voting Shares issuable upon conversion of all of the Multiple Voting Shares, we do not currently plan to require each holder of Multiple Voting Shares to convert their Multiple Voting Shares into Subordinate Voting Shares. Following any mandatory conversion of the Multiple Voting Shares, there will be a substantial increase in the number of outstanding Subordinated Voting Shares, which will result in dilution to existing holders of our Subordinated Voting Shares. 
 
 (iv) Anti-Dilution . The Multiple Voting Shares are subject to standard anti-dilution adjustments in the event the Company declares a distribution to holders of Subordinate Voting Shares, effects a recapitalization of the Subordinate Voting Shares, issues Subordinate Voting Shares as a dividend or other distribution on outstanding Subordinate Voting Shares, or subdivides or consolidates the outstanding Subordinate Voting Shares. In the event such an anti-dilution adjustment occurs, it shall be effected by adjusting the Conversion Ratio applicable to the Multiple Voting Shares at such time. As a result, holders of Multiple Voting Shares shall be entitled to (i) a proportionate share of any distribution as though they were holders of the number of Subordinate Voting Shares into which their Multiple Voting Shares are convertible as of the record date fixed for determination of the holders of Subordinate Voting Shares entitled to receive such distribution and (ii) receive, upon conversion of Multiple Voting Shares, the number of Subordinate Voting Shares or other securities or property of the Company or otherwise, to which a holder of Subordinate Voting Shares deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled in connection with a recapitalization or stock split. 

(v) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments . No fractional Subordinate Voting Shares shall be issued upon the conversion of any share or shares of Multiple Voting Shares and the number of Subordinate Voting Shares to be issued shall be rounded up to the nearest whole Subordinate Voting Share. 

Note Warrants 
 
 We issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,470,000 Subordinate Voting Shares, which we refer to as the June Warrants, on June 18, 2019 and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,560,000 Subordinate Voting Shares, which we refer to as the November Warrants and together with the June Warrants as the Note Warrants, on November 7, 2019. The November Warrants form of single class with, trade under the same 

CUSIP number as, and have the same terms as the June Warrants. The Note Warrants are governed by a warrant indenture dated June 18, 2019, as supplemented pursuant to a supplement dated November 7, 2019, and which we refer to, as so supplemented, as the Warrant Indenture,) between us and Odyssey Trust Company, or the Warrant Agent, as warrant agent thereunder. Each Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Subordinate Voting Share at an exercise price of C 17.25 per share at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (Vancouver time) on June 18, 2022, subject to adjustment in certain events. 
 
 The Warrant Indenture provides that the share ratio and exercise price of the Note Warrants will be subject to adjustment in the event of a subdivision or consolidation of the Subordinate Voting Shares. The Warrant Indenture also provides that if there is (a) a reclassification or change of the Subordinate Voting Shares, (b) any consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or other business combination resulting in any reclassification, or change of the Subordinate Voting Shares into other shares, or (c) any sale, lease, exchange or transfer our assets as an entity or substantially as an entirety to another entity, then each Warrantholder which is thereafter exercised shall receive, in lieu of Subordinate Voting Shares, the kind and number or amount of other securities or property which such holder would have been entitled to receive as a result of such event if such holder had exercised the Note Warrants prior to the event. No adjustment in the exercise price or the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Note Warrants will be required to be made unless the cumulative effect of such adjustment or adjustments would result in a change of at least 1 in the exercise price or a change in the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise by at least one one-hundredth of a Warrant Share, as the case may be. 
 
 No fractional Subordinate Voting Shares will be issuable upon the exercise of any Note Warrants, and no cash or other consideration will be paid in lieu of fractional shares. Warrantholders do not have any voting or pre-emptive rights or any other rights which a holder of Subordinate Voting Shares would have. 
 
 The Warrant Indenture provides that, from time to time, we may amend or supplement the Warrant Indenture for certain purposes, without the consent of the Warrantholders, including curing defects or inconsistencies or making any change that does not prejudice the rights of any holder. Any amendment or supplement to the Warrant Indenture that would prejudice the interests of the Warrantholders may only be made by extraordinary resolution , which is defined in the Warrant Indenture as a resolution either: (i) passed at a meeting of the Warrantholder at which there are Warrantholders present in person or represented by proxy representing of at least 10 of the aggregate number of the then outstanding Warrants (unless such meeting is adjourned to a prescribed later date due to the lack of quorum) and passed by the affirmative vote of the Warrantholders present in person or by proxy shall form a quorum) and passed by the affirmative vote of the Warrantholders representing not less than 66 2/3 of the aggregate number of all the then outstanding Warrants represented at the meeting and voted on the poll upon such resolution; or (ii) adopted by an instrument in writing signed by the Warrantholders representing not less than 66 2/3 of the aggregate number of all the then outstanding Note Warrants. 
 
 Registration Rights 
 
 In connection with the closing of our acquisition of PurePenn on November 12, 2020, we entered into registration rights agreements with certain of our Selling Shareholders pursuant to which we agreed to register for resale the Subordinate Voting Shares issued to such Selling Shareholders at the closing of the acquisition. All of the Subordinate Voting Shares covered under the PurePenn agreements (other than any Subordinate Voting Shares issuable upon achievement of the earnouts, if any) have been included in this registration statement. We paid the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of this registration statement. 
 
 In connection with our acquisition of certain assets from each of Patient Centric of Martha s Vineyard Ltd., or PCMV, and Nature s Remedy of Massachusetts, Inc., or Nature s Remedy, we agreed to register the Subordinate Voting Shares issued to PCMV and Nature s Remedy at the closing of the acquisitions. We expect the file one or more resale registration statements to register the Subordinate Voting Shares to be issued to PCMV and Nature s Remedy. In each case, we will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statement. 
 
 In connection with the closing of our acquisition of Anna Holdings LLC, which does business as Keystone Shops, on July 7, 2021, we entered into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which we agreed to register for resale the Subordinate Voting Shares issued to the sellers of Keystone Shops. We expect the file one or more resale registration statements to register the Subordinate Voting Shares issued to the sellers of Keystone Shops and we will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statement. 
 
 Lock-up Agreements 

In connection with the closing of our acquisitions of PurePenn and Solevo Wellness on November 12, 2020, we entered into lock-up agreements with the Selling Shareholders who participated in those transactions. Such lock-up agreements restrict the sale of the Subordinate Voting Shares that we issued in connection with the closing of such acquisitions by those parties for periods of six, twelve and eighteen months, in each case with respect to one third of the Subordinate Voting Shares issued to the Selling Shareholders. 
 
 2024 Notes 
 
 We issued US 70,000,000 aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes, which we refer to as the June Notes, on June 18, 2019 and US 60,000,000 aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes, which we refer to as the November Notes, on November 7, 2019. The June Notes and the November Notes, which we refer to collectively as the 2024 Notes, form a single series, trade under the same CUSIP number and have the same terms as to status, redemption or otherwise. The 2024 Notes were issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of the note indenture, or the Note Indenture, dated June 18, 2019, between us and Odyssey Trust Company or the Trustee, as trustee thereunder. The 2024 Notes bear interest at the rate of 9.75 per annum, payable semi-annually, in equal instalments, in arrears on June 18 and December 18 of each year, commencing on December 18, 2019. The 2024 Notes are irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by Trulieve US and will mature on June 18, 2024.

The 2024 Notes are subordinated in right of payment only to any Indebtedness that ranks senior to the 2024 Notes by operation of law. The 2024 Notes are secured by a general security interest in our assets (other than the shares of our unrestricted subsidiaries which currently consist of all subsidiaries other than Trulieve US) and a pledge of the shares of our restricted subsidiaries (which currently consists only of Trulieve US). The holders of the 2024 Notes also have a lien over the assets of the restricted subsidiaries (which currently consists only of Trulieve US) in certain instances that will rank pari passu with any future liens, other than certain permitted liens. 
 
 At any time and from time to time prior to June 18, 2021, we may redeem all or a part of the 2024 Notes, upon not less than 15 nor more than 60 days notice, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2024 Notes redeemed, plus the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, as of the applicable date of redemption (subject to the rights of holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). The Applicable Premium means, with respect to any 2024 Note on any redemption date, the greater of: (a) 1.0 of the principal of the 2024 Note that is to be prepaid pursuant to an optional redemption; and (b) the excess of: (i) the discounted value at such redemption date of the remaining scheduled payments of the 2024 Note; over (ii) the principal of the 2024 Note that is to be prepaid pursuant to an optional redemption. At any time prior to June 18, 2021, we may, on one or more occasions, redeem up to 35 of the aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes upon not less than 15 nor more than 60 days notice, at a redemption price equal to 109.75 of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, subject to the rights of holders on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings; provided that: (i) 2024 Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to at least 65 of the aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes issued under the Note Indenture remain outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption (excluding 2024 Notes held by us or our affiliates, and (ii) the redemption occurs within 90 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering. An Equity Offering is defined to include (i) a public or private offer and sale of our capital stock (other than (a) capital stock made to any subsidiary, (b) disqualified stock or (c) equity securities issuable under any employee benefit plan) to any person (other than a subsidiary) or (ii) a contribution to our equity capital by any person (other than a subsidiary). 
 
 If a Change of Control occurs, we will be required to make an offer to each holder of the 2024 Notes to repurchase all or any part (equal to 1,000 and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof) of that holder s 2024 Notes pursuant to an offer, which we refer to as a Change of Control Offer. A Change of Control is defined to include the occurrence of one of the following events: (a) the sale, lease, exchange or other transfer of all or substantially all of our and our restricted subsidiaries assets, taken as a whole; (b) any person or group of persons, acting jointly or in concert, is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50 of our voting stock; or (c) the adoption of a plan relating to our liquidation or dissolution. No later than 30 days following a Change of Control, we (or a third party in lieu of us) are required to mail to each 2024 Note holder the Change of Control Offer consisting of a notice describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control, an offer to repurchase the 2024 Notes on the repurchase date specified in such notice, which date will be no earlier than 15 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, and a description of the procedures that 2024 Note holders must follow in order to tender 2024 Notes (or portions thereof) for payment and to withdraw an election to tender 2024 Notes (or portion thereof) for payment. A Change of Control Offer by us, or by any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of us, 

may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making the Change of Control Offer. In the Change of Control Offer, we will offer payment in cash equal to not less than 101 of the aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, which date will be no earlier than the date of such Change of Control. If holders of not less than 90 in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2024 Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such 2024 Notes in a Change of Control Offer and we, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of us, purchases all of the 2024 Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, we or such third party, as the case may be, will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior notice, to redeem or purchase, as applicable, all 2024 Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price or purchase price, as the case may be, in cash equal to the applicable Change of Control Payment plus, to the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption.

 Provisions of British Columbia Law Governing Business Combinations 
 
 All provinces of Canada have adopted National Instrument 62-104 entitled Take-Over Bids and Issuer Bids and related forms to harmonize and consolidate take-over bid and issuer bid regimes nationally, or NI 62-104. 
 
 The Canadian Securities Administrators, or CSA, have also issued National Policy 62-203 entitled Take-Over Bids and Issuer Bids, or the National Policy, which contains regulatory guidance on the interpretation and application of NI 62-104 and on the conduct of parties involved in a bid. The National Policy and NI 62-104 are collectively referred to as the Bid Regime. The National Policy does not have the force of law, but is an indication by the CSA of what the intentions and desires of the regulators are in the areas covered by their policies. Unlike some regimes where the take-over bid rules are primarily policy-driven, in Canada the regulatory framework for take-over bids is primarily rules-based, which rules are supported by policy. 
 
 A take-over bid or bid is an offer to acquire outstanding voting or equity securities of a class made to any person who is in one of the provinces of Canada or to any securityholder of an offeree issuer whose last address as shown on the books of a target is in such province, where the securities subject to the offer to acquire, together with the securities beneficially owned by the offeror, or any other person acting jointly or in concert with the offeror, constitute in the aggregate 20 or more of the outstanding securities of that class of securities at the date of the offer to acquire. For the purposes of the Bid Regime, a security is deemed to be beneficially owned by an offeror as of a specific date if the offeror is the beneficial owner of a security convertible into the security within 60 days following that date, or has a right or obligation permitting or requiring the offeror, whether or not on conditions, to acquire beneficial ownership of the security within 60 days by a single transaction or a series of linked transactions. Offerors are also subject to early warning requirements, 

where an offeror who acquires beneficial ownership of , or control or direction over, voting or equity securities of any class of a reporting issuer or securities convertible into, voting or equity securities of any class of a target that, together with the offeror s securities, would constitute 10 or more of the outstanding securities of that class must promptly publicly issue and file a news release containing certain prescribed information, and, within two business days, file an early warning report containing substantially the same information as is contained in the news release. 
 
 In addition, where an offeror is required to file an early warning report or a further report as described and the offeror acquires or disposes of beneficial ownership of, or the power to exercise control or direction over, an additional 2 or more of the outstanding securities of the class, or disposes of beneficial ownership of outstanding securities of the class below 10 , the offeror must issue an additional press release and file a new early warning report. Any material change in a previously filed early warning report also triggers the issuance and filing of a new press release and early warning report. During the period commencing on the occurrence of an event in respect of which an early warning report is required and terminating on the expiry of one business day from the date that the early warning report is filed, the offeror may not acquire or offer to acquire beneficial ownership of any securities of the class in respect of which the early warning report was required to be filed or any securities convertible into securities of that class. This requirement does not apply to an offeror that has beneficial ownership of, or control or direction over, securities that comprise 20 of more of the outstanding securities of the class. 
 
 Related party transactions, issuer bids and insider bids are subject to additional regulation that may differ depending on the particular jurisdiction of Canada in which it occurs.

To be timely, a shareholder s notice must be received (i) in the case of an annual meeting of shareholders, not less than 35 days prior to the date of the annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting of shareholders is to be held on a date that is less than 50 days after the date on which the first public announcement of the date of the annual meeting was made, notice by the shareholder must be received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the date of such public announcement; and (ii) in the case of a special meeting (which is not also an annual meeting) of shareholders called for any purpose which includes the election of directors to the board of directors, not later than the close of business on the 15th day following the day on which the first public announcement of the date of the special meeting was made.

 Impediments to Change of Control 
 
 Our articles of incorporation do not contain any change of control limitations with respect to a merger, acquisition or corporate restructuring that involves us. 
 
 Ownership and Exchange Controls 
 
 Limitations on the ability to acquire and hold our shares may be imposed by the Competition Act (Canada).

Transactions that are subject to notification cannot be closed until the required materials are filed and the applicable statutory waiting period has expired or been waived by the Commissioner of Competition, or the Commissioner. Further, the Competition Act (Canada) permits the Commissioner to review any acquisition of control over or of a significant interest in our company, whether or not it is subject to mandatory notification. This legislation grants the Commissioner jurisdiction, for up to one year, to challenge this type of acquisition before the Canadian Competition Tribunal if it would, or would be likely to, substantially prevent or lessen competition in any market in Canada. 
 
 Limitation of Liability and Indemnification 
 
 We are subject to the provisions of Part 5, Division 5 of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia).

(iv) Borrower agrees that Lender may release, compromise, forbear with respect to, waive, suspend, extend or renew any of the terms of the Loan Documents (and Borrower hereby waives any notice of any of the foregoing), and that the Loan Documents may be amended, supplemented or modified by Lender and the other signatory parties and that Lender may resort to any Collateral in such order and manner as it may think fit, or accept the assignment, substitution, exchange, pledge, or release of all or any portion of any Collateral, for such consideration, or none, as it may require, without in any way affecting the validity of any liens over or other security interest in the remainder of any such Collateral (or the priority thereof or the position of any subordinate holder of any lien or other security interest with respect thereto); and any action taken by Lender pursuant to the foregoing shall in no way be construed as a waiver or release of any right or remedy of Lender, or of any Event of Default, or of any liability or obligation of Borrower, under any of the Loan Documents. 

(v) Enter the Mortgaged Property and complete construction (i) of any Remaining Construction Work (to the extent same has not been completed as determined by Agent) substantially in accordance with the Plans and Specifications or, (ii) at Agent s option, of the new Buildings provided that Borrower has commenced any construction work on the New Buildings on the Mortgaged Property and such New Buildings construction work has not been completed, as determined by Agent (substantially in accordance with the New Buildings Plans and Specifications). In connection therewith, Agent shall employ such persons and take whatever other action which may be reasonably necessary or desirable, in the opinion of the Agent, to complete the Remaining Construction Work or the construction work on the applicable New Buildings. All sums so expended by the Agent for the Remaining Construction Work shall be advanced by the Agent from the Escrow Agreement and based on each Lender s Ratable Share and shall be secured by the Mortgages. Any sums advanced by the Agent for construction work on the New Buildings shall be based on Lender s Ratable Share and secured by the Mortgages. It is understood that the Agent is under no obligation to complete the Remaining Construction Work or the construction of any New Buildings. 

(d) Default Rate . After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default or after the Maturity Date, whether or not the Agent has elected to accelerate the Debt evidenced by the Note, the Loan shall bear interest, determined on a daily basis, payable on demand, at the greater of the following rates (i) the rate set forth in Section 1(a) of the Note for the Loan plus five percentage points (500 basis points) per annum or (ii) the Agent s Prime Rate plus five percentage points (500 basis points) (the Default Rate ), but in no event more than the Maximum Rate in respect of Borrower, until the unpaid balance of the Principal Sum, interest and any charges shall have been paid in full. Borrower acknowledges that (i) the Default Rate is a material inducement to the Agent to make the Loan; (ii) the Agent would not have made the Loan in the absence of the agreement of Borrower to pay the Default Rate; (iii) the Default Rate represents compensation for increased risk to the Agent that the Loan will not be repaid; and (iv) 

25 
 DOCPROPERTY CUS_DocIDChunk0 9289539 v8 
 
 the Default Rate is not a penalty and represents a reasonable estimate of (a) the cost to the Agent in allocating its resources (both personnel and financial) to the ongoing review, monitoring, administration and collection of the Loan, and (b) compensation to the Agent for losses that are difficult to ascertain. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Agent, the Default Rate shall (a) be applied retroactive to the date of the first occurrence of the Event of Default, (b) be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and (c) survive entry of a judgment relating to the Loan. The Agent s Prime Rate is not necessarily the lowest rate or best rate of interest charged by Agent for commercial or other types of loans made by Lender and shall be subject to increase or decrease in such Agent s Prime Rate effective as of the day any such change occurs. The Agent s determination of the Agent s Prime Rate shall be conclusive and final. 

(e) Setoff, Etc . Borrower hereby grants to Agent and Lender a lien, security interest and a right of setoff as security for all liabilities and obligations to Agent, whether now existing or hereafter arising, upon and against all deposits, credits, collateral and property, now or hereafter in the possession, custody, safekeeping or control of Agent, Lender or any entity under the control of Agent, Lender or in transit to any of them. At any time after an Event of Default, without demand or notice, Agent or Lender may set off the same or any part thereof and apply the same to any liability or obligation of Borrower even though unmatured and regardless of the adequacy of any other collateral securing the Loan. ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO REQUIRE AGENT OR LENDER TO EXERCISE ITS RIGHTS OR REMEDIES WITH RESPECT TO ANY OTHER COLLATERAL WHICH SECURES THE LOAN, PRIOR TO EXERCISING ITS RIGHT OF SETOFF WITH RESPECT TO SUCH DEPOSITS, CREDITS, COLLATERAL OR OTHER PROPERTY OF BORROWER, ARE HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVED. Agent shall not be required to marshal any present or future security for, or guarantees of, the obligations or to resort to any such security or guarantee in any particular order and Borrower waives, to the fullest extent that it lawfully can, (i) any right it might have to require Agent to pursue any particular remedy before proceeding against Borrower and (ii) any right to the benefit of, or to direct the application of the proceeds of any Collateral until the obligations are paid in full. 

(f) Costs and Expenses . Following the occurrence of any Event of Default hereunder, Borrower shall pay to Agent, within ten (10) Business Days of written demand by Agent, all reasonable costs and expenses (including all reasonable amounts paid to attorneys, accountants, real estate brokers, appraisers, and other advisors employed by Agent and Lender and to any contractors for labor and materials), actually incurred by Agent in the exercise of any of its rights, remedies or powers under any of the Loan Documents, as a secured or unsecured creditor, as the case may be, of Borrower, or any other Obligor, or with respect to any Collateral, and any amount thereof not paid within such ten (10) Business Day period together with interest thereon at the Default Rate from the date of such demand, shall become part of the Loan and shall be secured by the Mortgages and all other Collateral. In connection with and as part of the foregoing, in the event that any of the Loan Documents are placed in the hands of an attorney for the collection of any sum payable thereunder, Borrower agrees to pay reasonable attorneys' fees for the collection of the amount being claimed under such Loan Document, as well as all costs, disbursements, and allowances provided by law, the payment of which sums shall be secured by the Mortgages and all other Collateral. Nothing in this paragraph 7(f) shall limit the obligation of Borrower to pay any and all actual costs and expenses for which Borrower is otherwise liable under any of the Loan Documents.

 28 
 DOCPROPERTY CUS_DocIDChunk0 9289539 v8

 (b) Authorization and Action . 

(i) Each Lender hereby appoints and authorizes Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under the Loan Documents as are delegated to Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of the Note), Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Lender, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders; provided , however , that Agent shall not be required to take any action which exposes Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law. Agent agrees to give to each Lender prompt notice of each material notice given to it by Borrower pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents. 

(ii) By their execution of this Agreement, all of the Lenders hereby authorize and direct Agent to act on their behalf in all respects in connection with the Loan Documents and the making of the Loan (but subject to paragraph (v) below) and agree with Borrower that Borrower shall only be required to and shall only deal with Agent and each of the Lenders shall be bound by any acts of Agent.

Agent agrees that during a period of forty five (45) days from Agent s notice to Lenders of any 

29 
 DOCPROPERTY CUS_DocIDChunk0 9289539 v8 
 
 such Event of Default, Agent will not take any such material remedial action without the prior agreement of the Majority Lenders unless in Agent s good faith judgment it is necessary to take more prompt remedial action within such period, with or without the agreement of the Majority Lenders, in order to preserve any collateral for the payment of the Loan or substantive rights or remedies under any of the Loan Documents. Agent shall advise Lenders from time to time of such remedial action as Agent shall have taken. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Majority Lenders do not agree on the action to be taken, except as expressly set forth in this Section, Agent reserves the right, in its sole discretion, in each instance, without prior notice to Lenders, to consent to any action or failure to act by Borrower, and to exercise or refrain from exercising any powers or rights Agent may have under or in respect of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents relative thereto or any collateral therefor, which would be reasonable.

With respect to Agent s ownership interest in the Loan and the Loan Documents as a Lender, Agent in its capacity as a Lender shall have the rights and powers of a Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as set forth herein and therein and may exercise the same as though it were not Agent. Agent in its capacity as a Lender and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of accept investment banking engagements from and generally engage in any kind of business with, Borrower, any of its Affiliates and/or subsidiaries and any Person who may do business with or own securities of Borrower, any of its Affiliates and/or subsidiaries, all as if such Lender were not the Agent and without any duty to account therefor to the other Lenders.

The failure of any Lender to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any amount required to be paid by the Lender to the Agent as provided herein shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to reimburse the Agent for its ratable share of such amount, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to reimburse the Agent for such other Lender s ratable share of such amount.
