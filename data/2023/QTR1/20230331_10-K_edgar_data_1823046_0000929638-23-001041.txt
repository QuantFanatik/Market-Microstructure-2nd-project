 Item 1117 of Regulation AB. Legal Proceedings.

 As a consumer finance company, Exeter Finance LLC Exeter is subject to various consumer claims and litigation seeking damages and statutory
 penalties, based upon, among other things, usury, disclosure inaccuracies, wrongful repossession, violations of bankruptcy stay provisions, certificate of title disputes, fraud, breach of contract, improper collection practices, credit bureau
 reporting and discriminatory treatment of credit applicants. Some litigation against Exeter could take the form of class action complaints by consumers. As the assignee or purchaser of automobile loan contracts originated indirectly by dealers or
 originated directly by the direct lender, in each case for sale or assignment to Exeter, Exeter also may be named as a co-defendant in lawsuits filed by consumers principally against such dealers or the direct lender. The damages and penalties
 claimed by consumers in these types of matters can be substantial. The relief requested by plaintiffs varies but can include requests for compensatory, statutory and punitive damages. Exeter is also party to, or is periodically otherwise involved
 in, reviews, investigations, examinations and proceedings (both formal and informal), and information-gathering requests, by government and self-regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the United
 States Department of Justice, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and various state regulatory and enforcement agencies. The penalties and remedies sought by government and self-regulatory agencies in these
 types of matters can be substantial. Exeter believes that it has taken prudent steps to address and mitigate the litigation and regulatory risks associated with its business activities. As of the date hereof, Exeter is not subject to litigation or
 reviews, investigations, examinations or proceedings by government or self-regulatory agencies that individually or in the aggregate would materially adversely affect the holders of the Notes.

 The following paragraph is disclosure received from Wells Fargo Bank, National Association Wells Fargo Bank ), which serves as the indenture
 trustee under the indenture for the Exeter Automobile Receivables Trust 2020-3 transaction.

In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF Limited Phoenix Light and certain related entities filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging claims
 against Wells Fargo Bank, in its capacity as trustee for a number of residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS trusts. Complaints raising similar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the Southern District of New York and by IKB
 International and IKB Deutsche Industriebank in New York state court. In each case, the plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo Bank, as trustee, caused losses to investors, and plaintiffs assert causes of action based upon, among other things, the
 trustee s alleged failure to notify and enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, notify investors of alleged events of default, and abide by appropriate standards of care
 following alleged events of default. In July 2022, the district court dismissed Phoenix Light s claims and certain of the claims asserted by Commerzbank AG, and subsequently entered judgment in each case in favor of Wells Fargo Bank. In August
 2022, Phoenix Light and Commerzbank AG appealed the district court s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Company previously settled two class actions filed by institutional investors and an action filed by the
 National Credit Union Administration with similar allegations. In addition, Park Royal I LLC and Park Royal II LLC have filed substantially similar lawsuits in New York state court alleging Wells Fargo Bank, as trustee, failed to take appropriate
 actions upon learning of defective mortgage loan documentation.

 place to provide reasonable assurance that each such Vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria or portion of the servicing criteria applicable to each such Vendor.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA

The management Management of the Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Company or Wells Fargo 
 is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable
 in regard to the servicing platform for the period as follows:

 Sale of Corporate Trust Services Business . On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo and certain of its affiliates
 sold substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to Computershare Trust Company, N.A. Computershare Trust Company ), Computershare Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare
 Limited , and collectively with Computershare Trust Company and CDTC, Computershare ). Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of
 the sale. See Appendix B for more information regarding such transition as it relates to the ABS Platform (defined below). 

 Period : As of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 (the Period ). 

 Platform : The platform consists of asset-backed securities ABS transactions for which the Company
 was appointed to provide trustee (except Delaware trustee or owner trustee), paying agent services, and/or related services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for such ABS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a
 registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued securities for such ABS transactions were privately offered pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company has an obligation under the
 transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes (i) any transactions for which the securities issued are
 mortgage-backed securities or mortgage-related asset-backed securities, and (ii) certain transactions for which the issuing entity has a fiscal year that ends on a date other than the end of the calendar year (the ABS Platform ). As a
 result of Wells Fargo s sale of the CTS division to Computershare, Wells Fargo has not accepted any appointments to perform trustee, paying agent services, and/or related services, on new ABS transactions after November 1, 2021, other than a few
 exceptions to facilitate the transition of the CTS business to Computershare. Appendix A identifies the individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the ABS Platform for the Period. 

 Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period : Management has determined that the following servicing
 criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are relevant to the servicing activities performed by the Company with respect to the ABS Platform transactions for the Period: 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), and 1122(d)(2)(vi) (the Applicable Servicing
 Criteria ). Management has determined that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are not applicable to the Company s servicing activities with respect to the ABS Platform for the Period. 

 With respect to the ABS Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment of the Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing
 Criteria:

 1. Management is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

2. Management has assessed the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. In performing this assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item
 1122 of Regulation AB. 

 3. Based on such assessment for the Period, the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period. 

 KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to Management s assessment of the Company s compliance
 with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

Appendix B to the Company s Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria

Wells Fargo s transfer of its roles on the ABS Platform transactions to Computershare is ongoing. As of the beginning of the Period, Wells Fargo has not transferred to Computershare
 the roles associated with its trustee (except Delaware trustee or owner trustee), paying agent services, and/or related services, and the duties, rights, and liabilities for such roles, under the relevant agreements for any of the ABS Platform
 transactions. During the Period, for all the ABS Platform transactions, Wells Fargo engaged Computershare as a subservicer 1 to perform virtually all of Wells Fargo s
 obligations under the transaction agreements. As a result, the Company has determined that Computershare is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the ABS Platform and the applicable servicing criteria relevant to the
 servicing activities performed by Computershare for the ABS Platform (the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Accordingly, Computershare is taking, and Wells Fargo is not taking, responsibility for assessing Computershare s
 compliance with the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria for the ABS Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.

 specifically, since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo CTS business on November 1, 2021, the Company has closed new ABS transactions for which, during all or a portion of the Period, it performed the related ABS Platform Roles directly (the Company s

Direct Role Transactions ). The Company s Direct Role Transactions comprise a small percentage of the overall ABS Platform transactions. For a significant majority of ABS Platform transactions, the Company served, during all or a portion of the
 Period, as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related ABS Platform Roles (the Company s Agent Role Transactions ). Wells Fargo had not, as of the beginning of the Period, transferred to Computershare the ABS Platform Roles for the
 Company s Agent Role Transactions, and therefore the Company performed, during all or a portion of the Period, virtually all of Wells Fargo s contractual duties for such transactions as its agent. As a result, for the Company s Agent Role
 Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo have determined that the Company is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the ABS Platform, and accordingly, the Company is taking responsibility for assessing its compliance with
 the Applicable Servicing Criteria (defined below) relevant to the servicing activities performed by the Company for the ABS Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.

 Period : As of January 1, 2022 through and including December 31, 2022 (the Period ).

 Platform : The platform consists of asset-backed securities ABS transactions for which the Company
 provides trustee (except Delaware trustee or owner trustee), paying agent services, and/or related services, either directly in the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such services, and for which either (i) some or
 all of the issued securities for such ABS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (ii) the issued securities for such ABS transactions were privately offered
 pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company (and/or the party for whom it acts as agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item
 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes (a) any transactions for which the securities issued are mortgage-backed securities or mortgage-related asset-backed securities and (b) any ABS transactions for which the issuing
 entity has a fiscal year that ends on a date other than the end of the calendar year (the ABS Platform ). Appendix A identifies the individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the ABS Platform for the Period.

Applicable Servicing Criteria : All servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are applicable
 to either the Company s obligations, or the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the ABS Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s

Obligations ), except for the following servicing criteria: 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B), 1122(d)(3)(i)(C), 1122(d)(3)(i)(D), 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(viii),
 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii), and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has determined are not applicable to the Company s Obligations in the related transaction agreements with respect to the ABS
 Platform for the Period; provided however that, with respect to the ABS Platform (a) servicing criterion 1122(d)(3)(i)(A) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s Obligation to distribute or make available to investors, in accordance with
 the timeframes set forth in the transaction agreements, the relevant investor reports received by the Company from the entity preparing such reports; (b) servicing criterion 1122(d)(3)(ii) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s Obligation
 to make remittances to investors in accordance with the transaction agreements; and (c) servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s Obligation to obtain an Officer s Certificate from the servicer and report
 any additions, removals and substitutions to investors on the relevant investor report, in each case, in accordance with the transaction agreements (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). 

 Third parties classified as vendors : With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi), the
 Company has engaged a vendor for certain transactions in the ABS Platform to handle making payments to investors and/or third parties by check, and such vendor also safeguards any unissued checks. Management has determined that the vendor is not
 considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Management elects to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the servicing criterion applicable to the vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 . The Company has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable
 assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criterion applicable to the vendor. Management is solely responsible for determining that the Company meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for
 the vendor and the related servicing criterion.

 With respect to the ABS Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment of the
 Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria:

 1. Management is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria.

 2. Management has assessed the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria including
 the servicing criterion for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above. In performing this assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of
 Regulation AB.

 3. With respect to Applicable Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(xv), Management has
 determined that there were no activities performed during the Period with respect to the ABS Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities.

 4. Based on such assessment for the Period, the Company has complied in all
 material respects with the Applicable Servicing Criteria.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation
 report with respect to Management s assessment of the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP ON MANAGEMENT'S ASSERTION REGARDING COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA RELATING TO EXETER FINANCE LLC, DATED MARCH 29, 2023.

Exhibit 34.1 

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Managers

 Exeter Finance LLC

We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assertion Regarding Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that Exeter
 Finance LLC (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the publicly issued asset-backed security transactions backed by consumer auto retail installment
 sale contracts for which the Company acted as servicer and that were issued on or after January 1, 2006 (the Platform as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, except for 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi),
 1122(d)(4)(ix)-(xiii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv) which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by them with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. See Appendix B of management s assertion for the asset
 backed transactions covered by this platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the
 servicing criteria based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company
 Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
 circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise the platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform and determining
 whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria and as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations of the Division of Corporation
 Finance, Section 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our
 procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for
 the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We are required to be independent of Exeter Finance LLC and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to
 our examination engagement.

Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria.

As described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i), 1122(d)(4)(i)-(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(vi)-(viii), the Company has engaged various

1 

vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item
 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by C DI 200.06. As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has
 asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for
 determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06.

In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s
 Regulation AB, including servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i), 1122(d)(4)(i)-(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), and 1122(d)(vi)-(viii) for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for
 the platform, is fairly stated, in all material respects.

 transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes (i) any transactions for which the securities issued are
 mortgage-backed securities or mortgage-related asset-backed securities, and (ii) certain transactions for which the issuing entity has a fiscal year that ends on a date other than the end of the calendar year (the ABS Platform as of and for the

 applicable to the Company because the Company does not perform activities with respect to the ABS Platform relating to those servicing criteria. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. Our
 responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria based on our examination.

 determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing
 activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts
 calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a
 legal determination on the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria.

 by Interpretation 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor's activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to the
 vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the
 Company's determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06.

Appendix A to management's assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the ABS Platform.

 The Company s management is responsible for its assertion and for the Company's compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
 on management's assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination.

 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards
 established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the applicable servicing
 criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
 in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the ABS Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to the ABS Platform, and determining whether the Company
 processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the
 period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the
 Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal
 determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria.

 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement.

 In our opinion, management s assertion that Computershare Trust Company, National Association complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing
 criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the ABS Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.
