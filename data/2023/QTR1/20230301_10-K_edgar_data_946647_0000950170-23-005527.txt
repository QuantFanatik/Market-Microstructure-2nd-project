 Business Strategy 
 Premier s primary objective is to be a high-performing, community-focused financial institution, well regarded in its market areas.

Premier believes in a Customer First philosophy that is strengthened by its Mission Vision and Core Values initiatives. Premier also has a tagline of Powered by People as an indication of its commitment to local, responsive, personalized service. Premier believes this strategy results in greater customer loyalty and profitability through core relationships. Premier is focused on diversification of revenue sources and increased market penetration in areas where the growth potential exists for a balance between acquisition and organic growth. The primary elements of Premier s business strategy are commercial banking, consumer banking, the origination and sale of single-family residential loans, enhancement of fee income, wealth management and insurance sales, each united by a strong customer service culture throughout the organization. 
 Commercial and Commercial Real Estate Lending - Commercial and commercial real estate lending have been an ongoing focus and a major component of the Bank s success. The Bank primarily provides commercial real estate and commercial business loans with an emphasis on owner-occupied commercial real estate and commercial business lending, including a focus on the deposit balances that accompany these relationships. The Bank s client base tends to be small to middle market customers with annual gross revenues generally between 1 million and 50 million. These customers require the Bank to have a high degree of knowledge and understanding of their business in order to provide them with solutions for their financial needs. The Bank s Customer First philosophy and culture complement the needs of its clients. The Bank believes this personal service model differentiates the Bank from its competitors, particularly the larger regional institutions. The Bank offers a wide variety of products to support commercial clients including remote deposit capture and other cash management services. The Bank also believes that the small business customer is a strong market for the Bank. The Bank participates in many of the Small Business Administration lending programs. Maintaining a diversified portfolio with an emphasis on monitoring industry concentrations and reacting to changes in the credit characteristics of industries is an ongoing focus.

The Bank has directed its attention to loan types and markets that it knows well and in which it has historically been successful. The Bank strives to have loan relationships that are well diversified in both size and industry, and monitors the overall trends in the portfolio to maintain its industry and loan type concentration targets.

 Expansion Opportunities - Premier believes it is well positioned to take advantage of acquisitions or other business expansion opportunities in its market areas, Premier believes it has a track record of successfully accomplishing both acquisitions and de novo branching in its market area. This track record puts the Company in a solid position to enter or expand its business.

 Residential Loan Servicing Activities 
 Servicing mortgage loans for investors involves a contractual right to receive a fee for processing and administering loan payments on mortgage loans that are not owned by the Company and are not included on the Company s balance sheet. This processing involves collecting monthly mortgage payments on behalf of investors, reporting information to those investors on a monthly basis and maintaining custodial escrow accounts for the payment of principal and interest to investors and property taxes and insurance premiums on behalf of borrowers. At December 31, 2022, the Company serviced loans totaling 3.0 billion in principal. The vast majority of the loans serviced for others are fixed rate conventional mortgage loans. The Company primarily sells its loans to, and then services for, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and the FHLB. 
 As compensation for its mortgage servicing activities, the Company receives servicing fees, usually approximating 0.25 per annum of the loan balances serviced, plus any late charges collected from delinquent borrowers and other fees incidental to the services provided. In the event of a default by the borrower, the Company receives no servicing fees until the default is cured. Loan servicing fees decrease as the principal balance on the outstanding loan decreases and as the remaining time to maturity of the loan shortens. 
 Lending Activities 
 General Financial institutions are limited in the amount of loans they may make to one borrower. At December 31, 2022, the Bank s limit on loans-to-one borrower was 128.2 million. 
 Loan Portfolio Composition The net increase in net loans receivable over the prior year was 1.2 billion for 2022 and a net decrease of 195.1 million for 2021. The loan portfolio contains no foreign loans. The Company s loan portfolio is concentrated geographically in northwest, northeast and central Ohio, northeast Indiana, Morgantown, West Virginia, western Pennsylvania and southeast Michigan market areas. Management has identified lending for income-generating rental properties within commercial real estate as an industry concentration. Total loans for income-generating rental property totaled 2.4 billion at December 31, 2022, which represents 33.4 of the Company s loan portfolio.

 Originations, Purchases and Sales of Loans The lending activities of Premier are subject to the written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by the Board of Directors and management. Loan originations are obtained from a variety of sources, including referrals from existing customers, real estate brokers, developers and builders, newspaper, internet and radio advertising and walk-in customers. The Bank s loan approval process for all types of loans is intended to assess the borrower s ability to repay the loan, the viability of the loan and the adequacy of the value of the collateral that will secure the loan.

Asset Quality 
 Premier s credit policy establishes guidelines to manage credit risk and asset quality. These guidelines include loan review and early identification of problem loans to ensure sound credit decisions. Premier s credit policies and review procedures are meant to minimize the risks and uncertainties inherent in lending. In following the policies and procedures, management must rely on estimates, appraisals and evaluations of loans and the possibility that changes in these could occur because of changing economic conditions. 
 Delinquent Loans The following table sets forth information concerning delinquent loans at December 31, 2022, in dollar amount and as a percentage of Premier s total loan portfolio.

Overall, the level of delinquencies at December 31, 2022, decreased from the levels at December 31, 2021, when Premier reported that 0.74 of its outstanding loans were at least 30 days delinquent. The level of total loans 90 or more days delinquent has decreased to 0.44 at December 31, 2022, down from 0.48 at December 31, 2021. The level of total loans 60-89 days delinquent decreased to 0.15 at December 31, 2022, down from 0.20 at December 31, 2021. The level of loans that were 30 to 59 days past due increased to 0.14 at December 31, 2022, up from 0.07 at December 31, 2021. Management has assessed the collectability of all loans that are 90 days or more delinquent as part of its procedures in establishing the allowance for credit losses. Management believes the improving trends in the economy contributed to the decrease seen in 2022.

Non-performing Assets All loans are reviewed on a regular basis and are placed on non-accrual status when, in the opinion of management, the collectability of additional interest is not expected. Generally, Premier places all loans 90 days or more past due on non-accrual status. Premier also places loans on non-accrual status when the loan is paying as agreed but the Company believes the financial condition of the borrower is such that this classification is warranted. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, total unpaid interest accrued to date is reversed. Subsequent payments are generally applied to the outstanding principal balance but may be recorded as interest income, depending on the assessment of the ultimate collectability of the loan. Premier considers a loan individually evaluated when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due (both principal and interest) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Premier measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the loan s observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral, if collateral dependent. If the estimated recoverability of the individually evaluated loan is less than the recorded investment, Premier will recognize impairment by allocating a portion of the allowance for credit losses on cash flow dependent loans and by charging off the deficiency on collateral dependent loans. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Real estate acquired by foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold. Premier also repossesses other assets securing loans, consisting primarily of automobiles. When such property is acquired it is recorded at fair value less cost to sell. Costs relating to development and improvement of property are capitalized, whereas costs relating to holding the property are expensed. Valuations are periodically performed by management and a write-down of the value is recorded with a corresponding charge to operations if it is determined that the carrying value of property exceeds its estimated net realizable value. The balance of real estate owned at December 31, 2022, was 619,000. During 2022, there was 8,600 of expense related to write-downs in fair value of real estate acquired by foreclosure or acquisition. The balance of real estate owned at December 31, 2021 was 171,000. During 2021, there was 81,000 of expense related to write-downs in fair value of real estate acquired by foreclosure or acquisition. 
 As of December 31, 2022, Premier s total non-performing loans amounted to 33.8 million or 0.52 of total loans (net of undisbursed loan funds and deferred fees and costs), compared to 48.0 million or 0.91 of total loans, at December 31, 2021. Non-performing loans are loans which are 90 days or more past due or on non-accrual. 
 The following table sets forth the amounts and categories of Premier s non-performing assets (excluding individually evaluated loans not considered non-performing) and troubled debt restructurings at the dates indicated.

Allowance for credit losses Premier maintains an allowance for credit losses to absorb current expected losses in the loan portfolio. The allowance for credit loss is made up of two components. The first is a general reserve, which is used to record credit loss reserves for groups of homogenous loans in which the Company estimates the current expected credit losses in the portfolio based on quantitative and qualitative factors. Premier adopted the current expected credit losses CECL accounting standard in 2020. As a result, 2022, 2021 and 2020 credit loss and provision are not comparable to years prior to 2020 allowance for loan loss data. 
 The second component of the allowance for credit losses is the specific reserve in which the Company sets aside reserves based on the analysis of individual credits. In evaluating the adequacy of its allowance each quarter, management grades all loans in the commercial portfolio. See Item 7 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Allowance for credit losses for further discussion on management s evaluation of the allowance for credit losses. 
 Loans are charged against the allowance when such loans meet the Company s established policy on loan charge-offs and the allowance itself is adjusted quarterly by recording a provision for credit losses. As such, actual losses and losses provided for should be approximately the same if the overall quality, composition and size of the portfolio remained static along with a static economic environment. To the extent that the portfolio grows at a rapid rate or overall quality or the economic environment deteriorates, the provision generally will exceed charge-offs. However, in certain circumstances, net charge-offs may exceed the provision for credit losses when management determines that loans previously provided for in the allowance for credit losses are uncollectible and should be charged-off or as overall credit or the economic environment improves. Although management believes that it uses the best information available to make such determinations, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary, and net earnings could be significantly affected, if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the initial determinations. 
 At December 31, 2022, Premier s allowance for credit losses totaled 72.8 million compared to 66.5 million at December 31, 2021. The following table sets forth the activity in Premier s allowance for credit losses during the periods indicated.

Sources of Funds 
 General Deposits are the primary source of Premier s funds for lending and other investment purposes. In addition to deposits, Premier derives funds from loan principal repayments. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions. Borrowings from the FHLB may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds from other sources. They may also be used on a longer-term basis for general business purposes. 
 Deposits Premier s deposits are attracted principally from within Premier s primary market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including checking accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts, and term certificate accounts. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate. 
 To supplement its funding needs, Premier also has the ability to utilize the national market for certificates of deposit. Premier has used these deposits in the past and could in the future if necessary. Premier had no national market certificates of deposit as of December 31, 2022 or 2021. 
 Deposits are backed by the federal government for at least 250,000 per depositor. At December 31, 2022 and 2021 the Bank had approximate 2.5 billion and 1.9 billion, respectively, in uninsured deposits. 
 Average balances and average rates paid on deposits are as follows:

Borrowings The FHLB system functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for its member institutions and certain other financial institutions. As a member in good standing of the FHLB, Premier is authorized to apply for advances, provided certain standards of creditworthiness have been met. At December 31, 2022, Premier could borrow up to 2.0 billion. The Bank had 428.0 million in advances outstanding at December 31, 2022 and no outstanding advances at December 31, 2021. For additional information regarding Premier s FHLB advances and other debt, see Notes 11 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Subordinated Debentures For additional information regarding the Company s subordinated debentures see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Effect of Environmental Regulation - Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has not had a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of Premier or its subsidiaries. Premier believes the nature of the operations of its subsidiaries has little, if any, environmental impact. As a result, Premier anticipates no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for Premier s current fiscal year or for the foreseeable future. 
 Premier believes its primary exposure to environmental risk is through the lending activities of the Bank. In cases where management believes environmental risk potentially exists, the Bank mitigates environmental risk exposures by requiring environmental site assessments at the time of loan origination to confirm collateral quality as to commercial real estate parcels posing higher than normal potential for environmental impact, as determined by reference to present and past uses of the subject property and adjacent sites. In addition, environmental assessments are typically required prior to any foreclosure activity involving non-residential real estate collateral. 
 Human Capital 
 Premier had 1,206 employees at December 31, 2022 (comprised of 92.2 full-time employees and 7.8 part-time employees). None of these employees are represented by a collective bargaining agent, and Premier believes that it maintains good relationships with its personnel. Premier s talent acquisition processes are designed to attract top talent in the financial services industry and foster an inclusive, respectful and rewarding workplace. All employees receive training on the Company s Mission, Vision and Core Values. The Company is committed to fostering an environment that encourages diverse viewpoints, backgrounds and experiences and continues to explore additional diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. The Company offers a comprehensive compensation and benefits package to employees designed to attract, retain, motivate, and reward employees. The Company provides health benefits, including medical, dental and vision benefits, short- and long-term disability, and life insurance. 
 Competition 
 Competition in originating commercial real estate and commercial loans comes mainly from commercial banks with banking center offices in the Company s market area. Competition for the origination of mortgage loans arises mainly from savings associations, commercial banks, and mortgage companies. The distinction among market participants is based on a combination of price, the quality of customer service and name recognition. The Company competes for loans by offering competitive interest rates and product types and by seeking to provide a higher level of personal service to borrowers than is furnished by competitors. 
 Management believes that the Bank s most direct competition for deposits comes from local financial institutions. The distinction among market participants is based on price and the quality of customer service and name recognition. The Bank s cost of funds fluctuates with general market interest rates. During certain interest rate environments, additional significant competition for deposits may be expected from corporate and governmental debt securities, as well as from money market mutual funds. The Bank competes for conventional deposits by emphasizing quality of service, extensive product lines and competitive pricing. 
 Regulation 
 General Premier is subject to regulation examination and oversight by the Federal Reserve Board Federal Reserve ). The Bank is subject to regulation, examination and oversight by the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions ODFI ). The Banks's primary federal regulator is the FDIC. In addition, the Bank is subject to regulations of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB which was established by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as amended Dodd-Frank Act and has broad powers to adopt and enforce consumer protection regulations. 
 Holding Company Regulation Premier is subject to the requirements of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended BHC Act ), and examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve. Premier elected to become a financial holding company in 2020. The Federal Reserve has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies and financial holding companies, including, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist or removal orders, and require that a bank holding company divest subsidiaries (including its banking subsidiaries). In general, the Federal Reserve may initiate enforcement action for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. 
 11 

A bank holding company is required by law and Federal Reserve policy to serve as a source of financial strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support those subsidiary banks. The Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank and may disapprove of the payment of dividends to the shareholders of the bank holding company if the Federal Reserve believes the payment would be an unsafe or unsound practice. The Federal Reserve also requires bank holding companies to provide advance notification of planned dividends under certain circumstances. 
 The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve in any case where a bank holding company proposes to: acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares of any bank that is not already majority-owned by the bank holding company; acquire all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company. 
 In order to become a financial holding company, all of a bank holding company s subsidiary depository institutions must be well capitalized and well managed under federal banking regulations, and such depository institutions must have received a rating of at least satisfactory under the Community Reinvestment Act CRA ). In addition, the holding company must be well managed and must be well capitalized. 
 Financial holding companies may engage in a wide variety of financial activities, including any activity that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department consider financial in nature or incidental to financial activities, and any activity that the Federal Reserve determines to be complementary to a financial activity and which does not pose a substantial safety and soundness risk. These activities include securities underwriting and dealing activities, insurance and underwriting activities and merchant banking/equity investment activities. Because it has authority to engage in a broad array of financial activities, a financial holding company may have several affiliates that are functionally regulated by financial regulators other than the Federal Reserve, such as the SEC and state insurance regulators. 
 If a financial holding company or a subsidiary bank fails to meet the requirements for the holding company to remain a financial holding company, the financial holding company must enter into a written agreement with the Federal Reserve within 45 days to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. Until the Federal Reserve determines that the holding company and its subsidiary banks meet the requirements, the Federal Reserve may impose additional limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of the financial holding company or any affiliate that the Federal Reserve finds to be appropriate or consistent with federal banking laws. If the deficiencies are not corrected within 180 days, the financial holding company may be required to divest ownership or control of all subsidiary banks. If restrictions are imposed on the activities of the holding company, such restrictions may not be made publicly available pursuant to confidentiality regulations of the banking regulators. 
 In April 2020, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule to revise its regulations related to determinations of whether a company has the ability to exercise a controlling influence over another company for purposes of the BHC Act. The final rule expands and codifies the presumptions for use in such determinations. By codifying the presumptions, the final rule provides greater transparency on the types of relationships that the Federal Reserve generally views as supporting a facts-and-circumstances determination that one company controls another company. The Federal Reserve s final rule applies to questions of control under the BHC Act, but does not extend to the Change in Bank Control Act. 
 Regulation of Ohio State-Chartered Banks As an Ohio state-chartered bank, the Bank is supervised and regulated primarily by the ODFI and the FDIC. In addition, the Bank s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC, and the Bank will be subject to the applicable provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended, and certain other regulations of the FDIC. 
 Various requirements and restrictions under the laws of the United States and the State of Ohio will affect the operations of the Bank, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the nature and amount of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged thereon, restrictions relating to investments and other activities, limitations on credit exposure to correspondent banks, limitations on activities based on capital and surplus, limitations on payment of dividends, limitations on branching and increasingly extensive consumer protection laws and regulations. 
 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act - On May 25, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the Regulatory Relief Act was enacted, which repealed or modified certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and eased regulations on all but the largest banks (those with consolidated assets in excess of 250 billion). Bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than 100 billion, including Premier, are no longer subject to enhanced prudential standards. The Regulatory Relief Act also relieves bank holding companies and banks with consolidated assets of less than 100 billion, including Premier, from certain record-keeping, reporting and disclosure requirements. Certain other regulatory requirements applied only to banks with consolidated assets in excess of 50 billion and so did not apply to the Company even before the enactment of the Regulatory Relief Act.

Regulatory Capital Requirements and Prompt Corrective Action The federal banking regulators have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for financial institutions and their holding companies, as well as state member banks. The guidelines provide a systematic analytical framework, which makes regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations, takes off-balance sheet exposures expressly into account in evaluating capital adequacy and incentivizes holding liquid, low-risk assets. Capital levels as measured by these standards are also used to categorize financial institutions for purposes of certain prompt corrective action regulatory provisions. 
 The risk-based capital guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies are based on the International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standard, published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. New capital rules applicable to smaller banking organizations (the Basel III Capital Rules which also implement certain of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective commencing on January 1, 2015. Compliance with the new minimum capital requirements was required effective January 1, 2015, whereas a new capital conservation buffer and deductions from common equity capital phased in from January 1, 2016, through January 1, 2019, and most deductions from common equity tier 1 capital phased in from January 1, 2015 through January 1, 2019. 
 The Basel III Capital Rules include (i) a minimum common equity tier 1 CET1 capital ratio of 4.5 , (ii) a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0 , (iii) a minimum total capital ratio of 8.0 , and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4 . 
 Common equity for the CET1 capital ratio includes common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, plus limited amounts of minority interests in the form of common stock, less the majority of certain regulatory deductions. 
 Tier 1 capital includes common equity as defined for the CET1 capital ratio, plus certain non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, trust preferred securities that have been grandfathered (but which are not otherwise permitted), and limited amounts of minority interests in the form of additional tier 1 capital instruments, less certain deductions. 
 Tier 2 capital, which can be included in the total capital ratio, includes certain capital instruments (such as subordinated debentures) and limited amounts of the allowance for credit losses, subject to specified eligibility criteria, less applicable deductions. 
 The deductions from CET1 capital include goodwill and other intangibles, certain deferred tax assets, mortgage-servicing assets above certain levels, gains on sale in connection with a securitization, investments in a banking organization s own capital instruments and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions (above certain levels). 
 Under the guidelines, capital is compared to the relative risk included in the balance sheet. To derive the risk included in the balance sheet, one of several risk weights is applied to different balance sheet and off-balance sheet assets, primarily based on the relative credit risk of the counterparty. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 
 The Basel III Capital Rules also place restrictions on the payment of capital distributions, including dividends, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the company does not hold a capital conservation buffer of greater than 2.5 composed of CET1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements, or if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5 at the beginning of the quarter. 
 The federal banking agencies have established a system of prompt corrective action to resolve certain problems of undercapitalized banks. This system is based on five capital level categories for insured depository institutions: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. The federal banking agencies may (or in some cases must) take certain supervisory actions depending upon a bank's capital level. For example, the banking agencies must appoint a receiver or conservator for a bank within 90 days after it becomes critically undercapitalized unless the bank's primary regulator determines, with the concurrence of the FDIC, that other action would better achieve regulatory purposes. Banking operations otherwise may be significantly affected depending on a bank's capital category. For example, a bank that is not well capitalized generally is prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market, and the holding company of any undercapitalized depository institution must guarantee, in part, specific aspects of the bank's capital plan for the plan to be acceptable. 
 In accordance with the Basel III Capital Rules, in order to be well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action guidelines, a financial institution must have a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5 , a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0 , a tier 1 risk-based capital of at least 8.0 and a leverage ratio of at least 5.0 , and the institution must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank met the capital ratio requirements to be deemed well-capitalized according to the guidelines described above. See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In December 2019, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule to address regulatory treatment of credit loss allowances under the CECL accounting standard. The rule revised the federal banking agencies regulatory capital rules to identify which credit loss allowances under the CECL model are eligible for inclusion in regulatory capital and to provide banking organizations the option to phase in over three years the day one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the CECL model. Concurrent with the enactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020, as amended (the CARES Act ), discussed below, federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that delayed the estimated impact on regulatory capital resulting from the adoption of CECL. The interim final rule provided banking organizations that implemented CECL prior to the end of 2020 the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital relative to regulatory capital determined under the prior incurred loss methodology, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay. On August 26, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that made certain technical changes to the interim final rule, including expanding the pool of eligible institutions. The changes in the final rule applied only to those banking organizations that elected the CECL transition relief provided for under the rule. Premier adopted CECL on January 1, 2020. 
 In September 2019, consistent with Section 201 of the Regulatory Relief Act, the Federal Reserve, along with the other federal bank regulatory agencies, issued a final rule, effective January 1, 2020, that gave community banks, including the Bank, the option to calculate a simple leverage ratio to measure capital adequacy if the community banks met certain requirements. Under the rule, a community bank was eligible to elect the Community Bank Leverage Ratio CBLR framework if it had less than 10 billion in total consolidated assets, limited amounts of certain trading assets and liabilities, limited amounts of off-balance sheet exposures and a leverage ratio greater than 9.0 . Pursuant to the CARES Act, on August 26, 2020, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule, effective on October 1, 2020, that temporarily lowered the CBLR threshold and provided a gradual transition back to the prior level. Specifically, the CBLR threshold was reduced to 8.0 for the remainder of 2020, increased to 8.5 for 2021, and returned to 9.0 on January 1, 2022. Premier did not utilize the CBLR in assessing capital adequacy. 
 Dividends There are various legal limitations on the extent to which a subsidiary bank may finance or otherwise supply funds to its parent holding company. Under applicable federal and state laws, a subsidiary bank may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, make loans or extensions of credit to, or investments in the securities of, its parent holding company. A subsidiary bank is also subject to collateral security requirements for any loan or extension of credit permitted by such exceptions. The Bank paid 58.0 million in net dividends to Premier in 2022 and 35.0 million in 2021. First Insurance paid 2.0 million in dividends to Premier in 2022 and 2021. Premier Risk Management paid 1.6 million in dividends to Premier in 2022 and 1.8 million in dividends in 2021. PFC Capital received 3.0 million in cash infusion in 2022 and paid 7.5 million in dividends in 2021. 
 Premier s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is primarily dependent on its receipt of dividends from the Subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve expects Premier to serve as a source of strength for the Bank and may require Premier to retain capital for further investment in the Bank, rather than pay dividends to Premier shareholders. Payment of dividends by Premier or the Bank may be restricted at any time at the discretion of its applicable regulatory authorities if they deem such dividends to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. These provisions could have the effect of limiting Premier's ability to pay dividends on its common shares. 
 Deposit Insurance The FDIC maintains the Deposit Insurance Fund DIF ), which insures the deposit accounts of the Bank to the maximum amount provided by law. The general insurance limit is 250,000 per separately insured depositor. This insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the U. S. government. 
 As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, federally-insured institutions. It also may prohibit any federally-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the DIF and it has the authority to take enforcement actions against insured institutions. Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or written agreement entered into with the FDIC. 
 14 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended FDIA requires the FDIC's Board of Directors to set a target or Designated Reserve Ratio DRR for the DIF annually. The DRR is the total of the DIF divided by the total estimated insured deposits of the industry. Under the long-range plan, the FDIC set the DRR at 2.0 and set a schedule of assessment rates that would progressively decrease when the DRR reached 2.0 and 2.5 . The FDIC views the 2.0 DRR as a long-term goal and the minimum level needed to withstand future crises of the magnitude of past crises. Extraordinary growth in insured deposits during the first and second quarters of 2020 caused the DRR to decline below the statutory minimum of 1.35 as of June 30, 2020. In September 2020, the FDIC Board of Directors adopted a restoration plan to restore the DRR to at least 1.35 by 2028, absent extraordinary circumstances, as required by the FDIA. The restoration plan maintained the assessment rate schedules in place at the time and required the FDIC to update its analysis and projections for the DIF balance and DRR at least semiannually. In the semiannual update for the restoration plan in June 2022, the FDIC projected that the DRR was at risk of not reaching the statutory minimum of 1.35 by September 30, 2028, the statutory deadline to restore the DRR. Based on this update, the FDIC Board approved an amended restoration plan, and concurrently proposed an increase in initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by two basis points, applicable to all insured depository institutions. In October 2022, the FDIC Board finalized the increase with an effective date of January, 1, 2023, applicable to the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The revised assessment rate schedules are intended to increase the likelihood that the DRR reaches the statutory minimum level of 1.35 by September 30, 2028. 
 Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations Banks are subject to periodic examination to ensure compliance with federal statutes and regulations applicable to their business, including consumer protection statutes and implementing regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which has extensive regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has adopted numerous rules with respect to consumer protection laws and has commenced related enforcement actions. The following are just a few of the consumer protection laws applicable to the Bank: 
 Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 CRA ): imposes a continuing and affirmative obligation to fulfill the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. 

Equal Credit Opportunity Act: prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction on the basis of any of various criteria. 

Truth in Lending Act: requires that credit terms are disclosed in a manner that permits a consumer to understand and compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably. 

Fair Housing Act: makes it unlawful for a lender to discriminate in its housing-related lending activities against any person on the basis of any of certain criteria. 

Home Mortgage Disclosure Act: requires financial institutions to collect data that enables regulatory agencies to determine whether the financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the communities in which they are located. 

Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act: requires that lenders provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements and prohibits abusive practices that increase borrowers costs. 

Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act: requires financial institutions to establish policies and procedures to restrict the sharing of non-public customer data with non-affiliated parties and to protect customer information from unauthorized access. 

The banking regulators also use their authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act to take supervisory or enforcement action with respect to unfair or deceptive acts or practices by banks that may not necessarily fall within the scope of specific banking or consumer finance law. 
 On July 22, 2020, the CFPB issued a final small dollar loan rule related to payday, vehicle title and certain high cost installment loans (the Small Dollar Rule that modified a former rule that was issued in November 2013. Specifically, the Small Dollar Rule revokes provisions contained in the 2013 rule that: (i) provide that it is an unfair and abusive practice for a lender to make a covered short-term or longer-term balloon-payment loan, including payday and vehicle title loans, without reasonably determining that consumers have the ability to repay those loans according to their terms; (ii) prescribe mandatory underwriting requirements for making the ability-to-repay determination; (iii) exempt certain loans from mandatory underwriting requirements; and (iv) establish related definitions, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements. 
 Further, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued interagency guidance on May 20, 2020, to encourage banks, savings associations, and credit unions to offer responsible small-dollar loans to customers for consumer and small business purposes. The Small Dollar Rule did not have a material effect on Premier s financial condition or results of operations on a consolidated basis in 2021. 
 15 

CRA - Under the CRA, every FDIC-insured institution is obligated, consistent with safe and sound banking practices, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA requires the appropriate federal banking regulator, in connection with the examination of an insured institution, to assess the institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to consider this record in its evaluation of certain applications to banking regulators, such as an application for approval of a merger or the establishment of a branch. An unsatisfactory rating may be used as the basis for the denial of an application to acquire another financial institution or open a new branch. As of its last examination, the Bank received a CRA rating of satisfactory. 
 Patriot Act In response to the terrorist events of September 11, 2001, the Uniting and Strengthening of America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, as amended (the Patriot Act was signed into law in October 2001. The Patriot Act gives the U. S. government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. Title III of the Patriot Act and related regulations require regulated financial institutions to establish a program specifying procedures for obtaining identifying information from customers seeking to open new accounts and establish enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report suspicious activity. The Bank has established policies and procedures that it considers to be in compliance with the requirements of the Patriot Act. 
 Volcker Rule The Volcker Rule, which became effective under the Dodd-Frank Act in 2015, prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring hedge funds, otherwise known as covered funds. On July 9, 2019, the five federal agencies that adopted the Volcker Rule issued a final rule to exempt certain community banks, including the Bank, from such rule, consistent with the Regulatory Relief Act. Under the final rule, community banks with 10 billion or less in total consolidated assets and total trading assets and liabilities of 5.0 or less of total consolidated assets were excluded from the restrictions of the Volcker Rule. On June 25, 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies also finalized a rule modifying the Volcker Rule s prohibition on banking entities investing in or sponsoring covered funds. Such rule permits certain banking entities to offer financial services and engage in other activities that do not raise concerns that the Volcker Rule was originally intended to address. To the extent that the Bank engages in any of the trading activities or has any ownership interest in or relationship with any of the types of funds regulated by the Volcker Rule, Premier believes that its activities and relationships comply with such rule, as amended. 
 Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation The U.S. Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, under authority of various laws, including designated foreign countries, nationals and others. OFAC publishes lists of specially designated targets and countries. Premier is responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, such targets and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious financial, legal and reputational consequences, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required. Regulatory authorities have imposed cease and desist orders and civil money penalties against institutions found to be violating these obligations. The Bank has established policies and procedures that it considers to be in compliance with OFAC requirements. 
 Cybersecurity In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish several lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing Internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the financial institution s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the financial institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If Premier fails to observe the regulatory guidance, it could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. 
 In February 2018, the SEC published interpretive guidance to assist public companies in preparing disclosures about cybersecurity risks and incidents. These SEC guidelines, and any other regulatory guidance, are in addition to notification and disclosure requirements under state and federal banking law and regulations. 
 In November 2021, the OCC, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC issued a final rule that became effective in May 2022 requiring banking organizations that experience a computer-security incident to notify certain entities. A computer-security incident occurs when actual or potential harm to the confidentiality, integrity or availability of an information system or the information occurs, or there is a violation or imminent threat of a violation to banking security policies and procedures. The affected bank must notify its respective federal regulator of the computer-security incident as soon as possible and no later than 36 hours after the bank determines a computer-security incident that rises to the level of a notification incident has occurred. These notifications are intended to promote early awareness of threats to banking organizations and will help banks react to those threats before they manifest into larger incidents. This rule also requires bank service providers to notify their bank organization customers of a computer-security incident that has caused, or is reasonably likely to cause, a material service disruption or degradation for four or more hours. 
 16 

Furthermore, once final rules are adopted, the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act, enacted in March 2022, will require certain covered entities to report a covered cyber incident to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security s Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency CISA within 72 hours after it reasonably believes an incident has occurred. Separate reporting to CISA will also be required within 24 hours, if a ransom payment is made as a result of a ransomware attack. 
 State regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs, including data encryption requirements. Many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements. Premier expects this trend of state-level activity in those areas to continue and is continually monitoring developments in the states in which its customers are located. 
 Executive and Incentive Compensation Public companies will be required, once stock exchanges adopt additional listing requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act and rules adopted by the SEC in October 2022, to adopt and implement clawback procedures policies for incentive compensation payments and to disclose the details of the procedures which allow recovery of incentive compensation that was paid on the basis of erroneous financial information necessitating an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements. This clawback policy is intended to apply to compensation paid within the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date the issuer is required to prepare a restatement a three-year look-back window of the restatement and would cover all executives (including former executives) who received incentive awards. 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors 
 The risks listed below present risks that could have a material impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, or business. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company s business operations. 
 Economic and Market Risks 
 The economic impact of COVID-19 or any other pandemic could adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows, and results of operations. 
 COVID-19 has negatively impacted global, national and local economies, disrupted global and national supply chains, lowered equity market valuations, and created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue to impact Premier s business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as Premier s regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we hold and service Paycheck Protection Program PPP loans. These PPP loans are subject to the provisions of the CARES Act and to complex and evolving rules and guidance issued by the Small Business Administration SBA and other government agencies. While a large number of our PPP borrowers have applied for and received full or partial forgiveness of their loan obligations, we still have credit risk on the remaining PPP loans in the event the SBA determines that there is a deficiency in the manner in which we originated, funded or serviced such PPP loans, including any issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive funding. We could face additional risks in our administrative capabilities to service our PPP loans and to properly determine loan forgiveness. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which we originated, funded or serviced the PPP loan, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if the SBA has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency. 
 Premier s loan portfolio includes a concentration of commercial real estate loans and commercial loans, which involve risks specific to real estate value and the successful operations of these businesses. 
 At December 31, 2022, the Bank s portfolio of commercial real estate loans totaled 2.8 billion, or approximately 38.8 of total loans. The Bank s commercial real estate loans typically have higher principal amounts than residential real estate loans, and many of our commercial real estate borrowers have more than one loan outstanding. As a result, an adverse development on one loan can expose Premier to greater risk of loss on other loans. Additionally, repayment of the loans is generally dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Economic conditions and events outside of the control of the borrower or lender, including sustained inflation and rising interest rates, could negatively impact the future cash flows and market values of the affected properties. 
 At December 31, 2022, the Bank s portfolio of commercial loans totaled 1.1 billion, or approximately 14.8 of total loans. Commercial loans generally expose Premier to a greater risk of nonpayment and loss than commercial real estate or residential real estate loans since repayment of such loans often depends on the successful operations and income stream of the borrowers. The Bank s commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower such as accounts receivable, inventory, machinery or real estate. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. The collateral securing other loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, if any exists.

Premier targets its business lending towards small- and medium-sized businesses, many of which have fewer financial resources than larger companies and may be more susceptible to economic downturns. If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, Premier s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. 
 If Premier's actual credit losses exceed its allowance for credit losses, Premier's net income will decrease. 
 In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), Premier must maintain an allowance for credit losses that it believes is a reasonable estimate of the expected credit losses within the CECL model. Premier's allowance for credit losses is based upon a number of relevant factors, including, but not limited to, trends in the level of nonperforming assets and classified loans, current and projected economic conditions in the primary lending area, prior experience, possible losses arising from specific problem loans, and management's evaluation of the risks in the current portfolio. However, there are many factors that can result in actual credit losses exceeding the allowance. 
 For instance, in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, Premier may rely on information provided to it by customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. Premier may also rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. Such information may not turn out to be accurate. Further, Premier's loan customers may not repay their loans according to their terms, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. As a result, Premier may experience significant credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results. 
 The amount of future losses also is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in unemployment and interest rates that may be beyond management's control, and these losses may exceed current estimates. Further, federal regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review Premier's loans and allowance for credit losses and may require that Premier increase its allowance. Moreover, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB has changed its requirements for establishing the allowance, which became effective for Premier in the first quarter of 2020. Under the CECL model, we are required to use historical information, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts to estimate the expected credit losses. That accounting change exposes Premier to increased risk of failure to establish a sufficient allowance due to incorrect or inadequate methodologies and assumptions and the possibility that Premier will need to increase its allowance substantially through an increase to the provision for credit losses, which will adversely affect Premier's net income. 
 As a result of any of the above factors, Premier's allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover actual credit losses, and future provisions for credit losses could have a material adverse effect on Premier's operating results. There is no assurance that Premier will not further increase the allowance for credit losses. Either of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on Premier's financial condition and results of operations. 
 Changes in interest rates can adversely affect Premier s profitability. 
 Premier s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income, which is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities, and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond Premier s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest Premier receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect Premier s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, the fair value of Premier s financial assets and liabilities, and the average duration of certain assets and liabilities. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, Premier s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. While we generally invest in securities with limited credit risk, certain investment securities we hold possess higher credit risk, especially in light of the current economic landscape, since they represent beneficial interests in structured investments collateralized by residential mortgages. All investment securities are subject to changes in market value due to changing interest rates and implied credit spreads. Any substantial, unexpected, or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on Premier s results of operations and financial condition. 
 The Bank originates a significant amount of residential mortgage loans that it sells in the secondary market. The origination of residential mortgage loans is highly dependent on the local real estate market and the current interest rates. Increasing interest rates tend to reduce the origination of loans for sale and consequently fee income, which Premier reports as mortgage banking income. Conversely, decreasing interest rates have the effect of causing clients to refinance mortgage loans faster than anticipated. This causes the value of mortgage servicing rights on the loans sold to be lower than originally anticipated. If this happens, Premier may be required to write down the value of its mortgage servicing rights faster than anticipated, which will increase expense and lower earnings. Accelerated repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities could result in the reinvestment of funds at lower rates than the loans or securities were paying. 
 18 

Legal and Regulatory Risks 
 Laws, regulations and periodic regulatory reviews may affect Premier s results of operations. 
 The financial services industry is extensively regulated. Premier is subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of its operations. Laws and regulations may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors, borrowers, the DIF and the banking system as a whole, and not to benefit Premier s shareholders. Regulations affecting banks and financial services businesses are undergoing continuous changes, and management cannot predict the effect of these changes. The impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively impact Premier and its ability to increase the value of its business, possibly limiting the services it provides, increasing the potential for competition from non-banks, or requiring it to change the way it operates. 
 Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets held by an institution, the adequacy of an institution s allowance for credit losses and the ability to complete acquisitions. Additionally, actions by regulatory agencies against Premier could cause it to devote significant time and resources to defending its business and may lead to penalties that materially affect Premier and its shareholders. Even the reduction of regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on Premier and its shareholders if such lessening of restrictions increases competition within Premier s industry or market area. 
 In addition to laws, regulations and actions directed at the operations of banks, proposals to reform the housing finance market could negatively affect Premier s ability to sell loans. 
 The laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time. The potential exists for new laws and regulations, and bank regulatory agencies are expected to be active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations. Increased regulation could increase Premier s cost of compliance and reduce its income to the extent that they limit the manner in which Premier may conduct business, including its ability to offer new products, charge fees for specific products and services, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads. 
 Changes in tax laws could adversely affect Premier's financial condition and results of operations. 
 Premier is subject to extensive federal, state and local taxes, including income, excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding and ad valorem taxes. Changes to the tax laws could have a material adverse effect on Premier's results of operations. In addition, Premier's customers are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local taxes. Changes in taxes paid by customers, including changes in the deductibility of mortgage loan related expenses, may adversely affect their ability to finance activities or purchase properties or consumer products, which could adversely affect their demand for Premier's loans and deposit products. In addition, such negative effects on Premier's customers could result in defaults on the loans already made and decrease the value of mortgage-backed securities in which Premier has invested. 
 Increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks. 
 Companies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance ESG practices and disclosure. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to the environment, health and safety, diversity, labor conditions and human rights. Increased ESG-related compliance costs for us as well as among our third party vendors and various other parties within our supply chain could result in increases to our overall operational costs. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our reputation, ability to do business with certain partners, access to capital, and the price of our common shares. 
 Business and Operational Risks 
 Premier s ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost may adversely affect net income. 
 Premier s principal sources of liquidity are local deposits and wholesale funding sources such as FHLB advances, Federal Funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and brokered or other out-of-market certificate of deposit purchases. Premier also maintains a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity. Premier s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize its activities or on terms that are acceptable could be impaired by factors that affect Premier directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as further disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. 
 Other possible sources of liquidity include the sale or securitization of loans, the issuance of additional collateralized borrowings beyond those currently utilized with the FHLB, the issuance of debt securities and the issuance of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions, or borrowings from a commercial bank. 
 Any decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, pay dividends to our shareholders, or fulfill obligations such as repaying Premier s borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 19 

In addition, prior debt offerings could potentially have important consequences to Premier and its debt and equity investors, including: 
 requiring a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to make interest payments; 

making it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations; 

increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of its debt, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing; 

increasing its vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 

reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow its business; 

limiting its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry; 

placing it at a competitive disadvantage relative to its competitors that may not be as highly leveraged with debt; and 

limiting its ability to borrow additional funds as needed or to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase securities. 

We are continuing to evaluate these risks on an ongoing basis. 
 Competition affects Premier s earnings. 
 Premier s continued profitability depends on its ability to continue to effectively compete to originate loans and attract and retain deposits. Competition for both loans and deposits is intense in the financial services industry. The Company competes in its market area by offering superior service and competitive rates and products. The types of institutions Premier competes with include large regional commercial banks, smaller community banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance agencies and mutual funds. As a result of their size and ability to achieve economies of scale, certain of Premier s competitors can offer a broader range of products and services than the Company can offer. In addition, an inability to timely adapt to technological advances could pose a risk to the future success of our business operations. Digital or cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and other fintech technologies are designed to enhance transactional security and have the potential to disrupt the financial industry, change the way banks do business, and reduce the need for banks as financial deposit-keepers and intermediaries. Consumers may move money out of bank deposits in favor of other investments, including digital or cryptocurrency. Consumers can also shop for higher deposit interest rates at banks across the country, which may offer higher rates because they have few or no physical branches. To stay competitive in its market area, Premier may need to adjust the interest rates on its products to match rates of its competition, which could have a negative impact on net interest margin and results of operations. 
 Negative public opinion could damage our reputation and impact business operations and revenues. 
 As a financial institution, our earnings and capital are subject to risks associated with negative public opinion. Negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, the failure of any product or service sold by us to meet our clients expectations or applicable regulatory requirements, corporate governance and acquisitions, social media and other marketing activities, the implementation of environmental, social, and governance practices, or from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to any of the foregoing. Negative public opinion could affect our ability to attract or retain clients, could expose us to litigation and regulatory action, and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price or result in heightened volatility. Negative public opinion could also affect our ability to borrow funds in the unsecured wholesale debt markets. 
 The increasing complexity of Premier s operations presents varied risks that could affect its earnings and financial condition. 
 Premier processes a large volume of transactions on a daily basis and is exposed to numerous types of risks related to internal processes, people and systems. These risks include, but are not limited to, the risk of fraud by persons inside or outside the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and systems, breaches of data security and our internal control system and compliance with a complex array of consumer and safety and soundness regulations. Premier could also experience additional loss as a result of potential legal actions that could arise as a result of operational deficiencies or as a result of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
 Premier has established and maintains a system of internal controls that provides management with information on a timely basis and allows for the monitoring of compliance with operational standards. These systems have been designed to manage operational risks at an appropriate, cost effective level. Procedures exist that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and business practices are followed. Losses from operational risks may still occur, however, including losses from the effects of operational errors. 
 20 

Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information or confidential trade secrets, whether through a breach of the Company s computer systems or otherwise, could severely harm its business. 
 Potential misuse of funds or information by Premier s employees or by third parties could result in damage to Premier s customers for which Premier could be held liable, subject Premier to regulatory sanctions and otherwise adversely affect Premier s financial condition and results of operations. 
 Premier s employees handle a significant amount of funds, as well as financial and personal information. Premier also depends upon third-party vendors who have access to funds and personal information about customers. Cybersecurity breaches of other companies, such as the breach of the systems of a credit bureau, may result in criminals using personal information obtained from such other source to impersonate a customer of Premier and obtain funds from customer accounts. Further, Premier may be affected by data breaches at retailers and other third parties who participate in data interchanges with Premier s customers that involve the theft of customer credit and debit card data, which may include the theft of debit card personal identification numbers and commercial card information used to make purchases at such retailers and other third parties. Such data breaches could result in Premier incurring significant expenses to reissue debit cards and cover losses, which could result in a material adverse effect on Premier s results of operations. 
 Although Premier has implemented systems to minimize the risk of fraudulent taking or misuse of funds or information, there can be no assurance that such systems will be adequate or that a taking or misuse of funds or information by employees, by third parties who have authorized access to funds or information, or by third parties who are able to access funds or information without authorization will never occur. Premier could be held liable for such an event and could also be subject to regulatory sanctions. Premier could also incur the expense of developing additional controls and investing in additional equipment or contracts to prevent future such occurrences. Although Premier has insurance to cover such potential losses, Premier cannot provide assurance that such insurance will be adequate to meet any liability, and insurance premiums may rise substantially if Premier suffers such an event. In addition, any loss of trust or confidence placed in Premier by our customers could result in a loss of business, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, or result in a loss of investor confidence, adversely affecting Premier s stock price and ability to acquire capital in the future. Premier could also lose revenue by the wrongful appropriation of confidential information about its business operations by competitors who use the information to compete with Premier. 
 Premier could suffer a material adverse impact from interruptions in the effective operation of, or security breaches affecting, Premier s computer systems. 
 Premier relies heavily on its own information systems and those of vendors to conduct business and to process, record, and monitor transactions. Risks to the system could result from a variety of factors, including the potential for bad acts on the part of hackers, criminals, employees and others. As one example, some banks have experienced denial of service attacks in which individuals or organizations flood the bank s website with extraordinarily high volumes of traffic, with the goal and effect of disrupting the ability of the bank to process transactions. Other businesses have been victims of a ransomware attack in which a business becomes unable to access its own information and is presented with a demand to pay a ransom in order to once again have access to its information. Premier is also at risk for the impact of natural disasters, terrorism and international hostilities on its systems or for the effects of outages or other failures involving power or communications systems operated by others. These risks also arise from the same types of threats to businesses with which Premier deals. 
 Potential adverse consequences of attacks on Premier s computer systems or other threats include damage to Premier s reputation, loss of customer business, costs of incentives to customers or business partners in order to maintain their relationships, loss of investor confidence and a reduction in Premier s stock price, litigation, increased regulatory scrutiny and potential enforcement actions, repairs of system damage, increased investments in cybersecurity (such as obtaining additional technology, making organizational changes, deploying additional personnel, training personnel and engaging consultants), and increased insurance premiums, all of which could result in financial loss and material adverse effects on Premier s results of operations and financial condition. 
 If Premier forecloses on collateral property resulting in Premier s ownership of the underlying real estate, Premier may be subject to the increased costs associated with the ownership of real property, resulting in reduced income. 
 A significant portion of Premier s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, Premier may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, Premier may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. 
 In addition, when Premier forecloses on real property, the amount Premier realizes after a default is dependent upon factors outside of Premier s control, including, but not limited to, economic conditions, neighborhood real estate values, interest rates, real estate taxes, operating expenses of the mortgaged properties, zoning laws, governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies, and acts of God. Certain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate, principally real estate taxes and maintenance costs, may adversely affect the income from the real estate. Therefore, the cost of operating real property may exceed the rental income earned 
 21 

from such property, and Premier may have to sell the property at a loss. The foregoing expenditures could adversely affect Premier s financial condition and results of operations. 
 Premier s business strategy focuses on planned growth, including strategic acquisitions, and its financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if Premier fails to grow or fails to manage its growth effectively. 
 Premier s ability to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors, including the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, its ability to integrate mergers and other acquisitions and manage growth and Premier s ability to raise capital. There can be no assurance that growth opportunities will be available. 
 Premier may acquire other financial institutions or parts of institutions in the future, open new branches, and consider new lines of business and new products or services. Expansions of its business would involve a number of expenses and risks, including: 
 the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions or expansions into new markets; 

the potential inaccuracy of estimates and judgments used to evaluate the business and risks with respect to target institutions; 

the time and costs of hiring local management and opening new offices; 

the delay between commencing making acquisitions or engaging in new activities and the generation of profits from the expansion; 

Premier s ability to finance an expansion and the possible dilution to existing shareholders; 

the diversion of management s attention to the expansion; 

management s lack of familiarity with new market areas; 

the integration of new products and services and new personnel into Premier s existing business; 

the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and effects on Premier s results of operations; and 

the risk of loss of key employees and customers. 

If Premier s growth involves the acquisition of companies through mergers or other acquisitions, the success of such acquisitions will depend on, among other things, Premier s ability to combine the businesses in a manner that permits growth opportunities and cost efficiencies, and does not cause inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the ability of Premier to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions. 
 Failure to manage Premier s growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on its business, future prospects, financial condition or results of operations and could adversely affect Premier s ability to successfully implement its business strategy. 
 The Bank s ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory limitations which, to the extent Premier requires such dividends in the future, may affect its ability to pay dividends or repurchase its stock. 
 Premier is a separate legal entity from the Bank and does not have significant operations of its own. Dividends from the Bank provide a significant source of capital for Premier. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. The federal and state banking regulators require that insured financial institutions and their holding companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the Bank s primary regulator could assert that the payment of dividends or other payments by the Bank are an unsafe or unsound practice. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to Premier, Premier may not be able to pay its obligations as they become due, repurchase its stock, or pay dividends on its common stock. Consequently, the potential inability to receive dividends from the Bank could adversely affect Premier s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 
 Failure to integrate or adopt new technology may undermine Premier s ability to meet customer demands, leading to adverse effects on Premier s financial condition and results of operations. 
 The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Premier s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations. Digital or cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and other fintech technologies are being developed to change the way banks operate and are eliminating the need for banks as financial deposit-keepers and intermediaries. Premier may not be able to effectively implement or have the resources to implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could adversely affect Premier s business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 22 

The transition away from The London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR as a reference rate for financial contracts could negatively affect Premier s income and expenses and the value of various financial contracts. 
 LIBOR was used extensively in the U.S. and globally as a benchmark for various commercial and financial contracts, including adjustable rate mortgages, corporate debt, interest rate swaps and other derivative financial instruments. LIBOR is set based on interest rate information reported by certain banks, which are set to stop reporting such information after June 30, 2023. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rate Committee ARRC has recommended the use of a Secured Overnight Funding Rate SOFR as the set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates. SOFR is different from LIBOR in that it is a backward-looking secured rate rather than a forward-looking unsecured rate. 
 These differences could lead to a greater disconnect between our costs to raise funds for SOFR as compared to LIBOR. For cash products and loans, ARRC has also recommended Term SOFR, which is a forward looking SOFR based on SOFR futures and may in part reduce differences between SOFR and LIBOR. There are operational issues which may create a delay in the transition to SOFR or other substitute indices, leading to uncertainty across the industry. These consequences cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit. 
 The Bank has ceased originating loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments that are directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR could create considerable costs and additional risk for Premier. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from these referencing LIBOR. The transition will change Premier s market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Further, Premier s failure to adequately manage this transition process with its customers could adversely impact its reputation. Although Premier is currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, any market-wide transition away from LIBOR could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 General Risk Factors 
 Economic, political and financial market conditions may adversely affect Premier s operations and financial condition. 
 Premier s financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services Premier offers, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where the Company operates, mainly in the State of Ohio, Northeast Indiana and Southeast Michigan. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability of or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment, natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, changes in interest rates, fiscal and monetary policy, tariffs, a U.S. withdrawal from a significant renegotiation of trade agreements, trade wars, and other factors beyond Premier s control may adversely affect its deposit levels and composition, the quality of its assets including investment securities available for purchase, demand for loans, the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans and the value of the collateral securing the loans it makes. Because Premier has a significant amount of real estate loans, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral and Premier s ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. 
 Premier is at risk of increased losses from fraud. 
 Criminals are committing fraud at an increasing rate and are using more sophisticated techniques. In some cases, these individuals are part of larger criminal rings, which allow them to be more effective. Such fraudulent activity has taken many forms, ranging from debit card fraud, check fraud, mechanical devices attached to ATM machines, social engineering and phishing attacks to obtain personal information, or impersonation of clients through the use of falsified or stolen credentials. Additionally, an individual or business entity may properly identify itself, yet seek to establish a business relationship for the purpose of perpetrating fraud. An emerging type of fraud even involves the creation of synthetic identification in which fraudsters create individuals for the purpose of perpetrating fraud. Further, in addition to fraud committed directly against it, Premier may suffer losses as a result of fraudulent activity committed against third parties. Increased deployment of technologies, such as chip card technology, defray and reduce certain aspects of fraud; however, criminals are turning to other sources to steal personally identifiable information, such as unaffiliated healthcare providers and government entities, in order to impersonate the consumer and thereby commit fraud. 
 Premier may be the subject of litigation, which would result in legal liability and damage to its business and reputation. 
 From time to time, Premier and its subsidiaries may be subject to claims or legal action from customers, employees or others. Financial institutions like Premier are facing a growing number of significant class actions, including those based on the manner of calculation of interest on loans and the assessment of overdraft fees. Future litigation could include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Premier is also involved from time to time in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and other agencies regarding its businesses. These matters also could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. Like other financial institutions, Premier is also subject to risk from potential employee misconduct, including non-compliance with policies and improper use or disclosure of 
 23 

confidential information. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against Premier could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations and/or cause significant reputational harm to its business. 
 Climate change or other adverse external events could significantly impact the Company s business. 
 Banking regulators and other supervisory authorities, investors and other stakeholders have increasingly viewed financial institutions as important in helping to address the risks related to climate change both directly and with respect to their customers, which may result in financial institutions coming under increased pressure regarding the disclosure and management of their climate risks and related lending and investment activities. Given that climate change could impose systemic risks upon the financial sector, either via disruptions in economic activity resulting from the physical impacts of climate change or changes in policies as the economy transitions to a less carbon intensive environment, we face regulatory risk of increasing focus on our resilience to climate related risks, including in the context of stress testing for various climate stress scenarios. Ongoing legislative or regulatory changes regarding climate risk management and practices may result in higher regulatory, compliance, credit and reputational risks and costs.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ), this report includes non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional information that is useful to investors in helping to understand the underlying performance and trends of the Company. The Company monitors the non-GAAP financial measures and the Company s management believes such measures are helpful to investors because they provide an additional tool to use in evaluating the Company s financial and business trends and operating results. In addition, the Company s management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare the Company s performance to that of prior periods for trend analysis and for budgeting and planning purposes. 
 Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, which are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Readers should be aware of these limitations and should be cautious with respect to the use of such measures. To mitigate these limitations, the Company has practices in place to ensure that these measures are calculated using the appropriate GAAP or regulatory components in their entirety and to ensure that our performance is properly reflected to facilitate consistent period-to-period comparisons. The Company s method of calculating these non-GAAP measures may differ from methods used by other companies. Although the Company believes the non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this report enhance investors' understanding of our business and performance, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for those financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Financial Condition 
 Assets at December 31, 2022 totaled 8.46 billion compared to 7.48 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of 0.97 billion or 13.0 . The increase in assets was primarily due to an increase in loans offset by a decrease in securities. The net increase was primarily the result of an increase in total deposits of 624.7 million and FHLB advances of 428.0 million. 
 Securities 
 The securities portfolio decreased 172.4 million, or 14.1 , to 1.0 billion at December 31, 2022. This decrease, along with an increase in deposits of 624.7 million, was used to fund an increase in gross loans including held for sale of 1.1 billion. For additional information regarding Premier s investment securities see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Loans 
 Loans receivable, net of undisbursed loan funds and deferred fees and costs, increased 1.2 billion, or 18.0 , to 6.5 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase was mainly due to an increase in volume of loans. For more details on the loan balances, see Note 6 Loans to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The majority of Premier s commercial real estate and commercial loans are to small- and mid-sized businesses. The combined commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios, including PPP, totaled 3.82 billion and 3.35 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and accounted for approximately 59.1 and 63.3 of Premier s loan portfolio at the end of those respective periods. Premier believes it has been able to establish itself as a leader in its market area in commercial and commercial real estate lending by hiring experienced lenders and providing a high level of customer service to its commercial lending clients. 
 The one-to-four family residential portfolio totaled 1.54 billion at December 31, 2022, compared with 1.17 billion at the end of 2021, with the increase due to an increase in volume of new originations. At the end of 2022, such loans comprised 21.6 of the total loan portfolio, down from 22.1 at December 31, 2021. 
 Construction loans, which include one-to-four residential family and commercial real estate properties, increased to 605.5 million at December 31, 2022, compared to 384.9 million at December 31, 2021. These loans accounted for approximately 9.4 and 7.3 of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 28 

Home equity and home improvement loans increased to 277.6 million at December 31, 2022, from 264.4 million at the end of 2021. At the end of 2022, those loans comprised 3.9 of the total loan portfolio, consistent with 5.0 at December 31, 2021. 
 Consumer finance loans were 213.4 million at December 31, 2022 up from 126.4 million at the end of 2021. These loans accounted for approximately 3.0 and 2.4 of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 In order to properly assess the loans secured by real estate included in its loan portfolio, the Company has established policies regarding the monitoring of the collateral underlying such loans. The Company requires an appraisal that is less than one year old for all new secured real estate loans, and all renewed secured real estate loans where significant new money is extended. The appraisal process is handled by the Bank s Credit Department, which selects the appraiser and orders the appraisal. Premier s loan policy prohibits the account officer from talking or communicating with the appraiser to insure that the appraiser is not influenced by the account officer in any way in making a determination of value. The Bank generally does not require updated appraisals for performing loans unless significant new money is requested by the borrower. 
 When a secured real estate loan is downgraded to classified status, the Bank reviews the most current appraisal on file and, if appropriate, based on the Bank s assessment of the appraisal, such as age, market, etc. the Bank will discount the appraisal amount to a more appropriate current value based on inputs from lenders and realtors. This amount may then be discounted further by the Bank s estimation of the selling costs. In most instances, if the appraisal is more than twelve to fifteen months old, a new appraisal may be required. Finally, the Bank assesses whether there is any collateral short fall, taking into consideration guarantor support and liquidity, and determines if a charge-off is necessary. 
 All loans 90 days or more past due and/or on non-accrual are classified as non-performing loans. Non-performing status automatically occurs in the month in which the 90-day delinquency occurs. When a collateral dependent loan moves to non-performing status, the Bank generally gets a new third party appraisal and charges the loan down appropriately based upon the new appraisal and an estimate of costs to liquidate the collateral. All properties that are moved into the Other Real Estate Owned OREO category are supported by current appraisals, and the OREO is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, which is determined based on appraised value less the Bank s estimate of the liquidation costs. 
 The Bank does not adjust any appraisals upward without written documentation of this valuation change from the appraiser. When setting reserves and charge-offs on classified loans, appraisal values may be discounted downward based upon the Bank s experience with liquidating similar properties. 
 Appraisals are received within approximately 60 days after they are requested. The Bank s Special Assets Committee reviews the amount of each new appraisal and makes any necessary charge-off decisions at its meeting prior to the end of each quarter. 
 Any partially charged-off collateral dependent loans are considered non-performing, and as such, would need to show an extended period of time with satisfactory payment performance as well as cash flow coverage capability supported by current financial statements before the Bank will consider an upgrade to performing status. The Bank may consider moving the loan to accruing status after approximately six months of satisfactory payment performance. The Bank monitors and tracks its loan to value quarterly to determine accuracy and any necessary charge-offs. Based on these results, changes may occur in the processes used. 
 Loan modifications constitute a troubled debt restructuring TDR if the Bank, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. For loans that are considered TDRs and the balance is over 500,000, the Bank either computes the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the original loan s effective interest rate or it may measure impairment based on the fair value of the collateral. For those loans individually evaluated utilizing the present value of future cash flows method, any discount is carried as a specific reserve in the allowance for credit losses. For those loans individually evaluated utilizing the fair value of the collateral, any shortfall is charged-off or held as a specific reserve. For loans that are considered TDRs and the balance is under 500,000 a general reserve is carried in the allowance for credit losses based on a general reserve analysis. Loan modifications made as a result of COVID-19 may not be deemed TDR if certain criteria are met based on regulatory guidance. As of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Bank had 6.6 million and 7.8 million, respectively, of loans that were still performing and which were classified as TDRs. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses ACL 
 The Company adopted ASU 2016-13, the Current Expected Credit Loss CECL model on January 1, 2020. Under CECL, a valuation reserve was established in the ACL and maintained through expense in the provision for credit losses. Upon adoption of CECL, the Company made a one-time adjustment, net of taxes, to retained earnings for 1.9 million. The ACL represents management s assessment of the estimated credit losses the Company will incur over the life of the loan. ACL requires a projection of credit losses over the contract lifetime of the credit adjusted for prepayment tendencies. Management analyzes the adequacy of the ACL regularly through reviews of the loan portfolio. Consideration is given to economic conditions, changes in interest rates and the effect of such changes on collateral values and borrowers ability to pay, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and trends in past due and non-performing loan balances. The ACL is a material estimate that is susceptible to significant fluctuation and is established through a provision for credit losses based on management s evaluation of the inherent risk in the loan portfolio. In addition to extensive in-house loan monitoring procedures, the Company utilizes an outside party to conduct an independent loan review of commercial loan and commercial real estate loan relationships. The Company s goal is to have 45-50 of the portfolio reviewed annually using a risk based approach. Management utilizes the results of this outside loan review to assess the effectiveness of its internal loan grading system as well as to assist in the assessment of the overall adequacy of the ACL associated with these types of loans. 
 29 

The ACL is made up of two basic components. The first component of the allowance for credit loss is the specific reserve in which the Company sets aside reserves based on the analysis of individually analyzed credits. In establishing specific reserves, the Company analyzes all substandard, doubtful and loss graded loans quarterly and makes judgments about the risk of loss based on the cash flow of the borrower, the value of any collateral and the financial strength of any guarantors. If the loan is individually analyzed and cash flow dependent, then a specific reserve is established for the discount on the net present value of expected future cash flows. If the loan is individually analyzed and collateral dependent, then any shortfall is usually charged off. The Company also considers the impacts of any Small Business Administration SBA or Farm Service Agency FSA guarantees. The specific reserve portion of the ACL was 2.4 million at December 31, 2022, and 7.1 million at December 31, 2021. 
 The second component is a general reserve, which is used to record credit loss reserves for loans in which the Company estimates the potential losses over the contractual lifetime of the loan adjusted for prepayment tendencies. In addition, the future economic environment is incorporated in projections with loss expectations to revert to the long-run historical mean after such time as management can no longer make or obtain a reasonable and supportable forecast. For purposes of the general reserve analysis, the six loan portfolio segments are further segregated into fifteen different loan pools to allocate the ACL. Residential real estate is further segregated into owner occupied and nonowner occupied for ACL. Commercial real estate is split into owner occupied, nonowner occupied, multifamily, agriculture land and other commercial real estate. Commercial credits are comprised of commercial working capital, agriculture production, and other commercial credits. Construction is split out into construction residential and construction other. Consumer is further segregated in to consumer direct and consumer indirect. The Company utilizes three different methodologies to analyze loan pools. 
 Discounted cash flows DCF was selected as the appropriate method for loan segments with longer average lives and regular payment structures. This method is applied to a majority of the Company s real estate loans and consumer indirect. DCF generates cash flow projections at the instrument level where payment expectations are adjusted for prepayment and curtailment to produce an expected cash flow stream. This expected cash flow stream is compared to the contractual cash flows to establish a valuation account for these loans. 
 The probability of default/loss given default PD/LGD methodology was selected as most appropriate for loan segments with average lives of three years or less and/or irregular payment structures. This methodology was used for home equity and commercial portfolios. A loan is considered to default if one of the following is detected: 
 Becomes 90 days or more past due; 

Is placed on nonaccrual; 

Is marked as a TDR; or 

Is partially or wholly charged-off. 

The default rate is measured on the current life of the loan segment using a weighted average of the four most recent quarters. PD/LGD is determined on a dollar-ratio basis, measuring the ratio of net charged off principal to defaulted principal. 
 The consumer portfolio contains loans with many different payment structures, payment streams and collateral. The remaining life method was deemed most appropriate for the consumer direct loans, while the DCF method was deemed appropriate for the consumer indirect loans as stated above. The weighted average remaining life uses an annual charge-off rate over several vintages to estimate credit losses. The average annual charge-off rate is applied to the contractual term adjusted for prepayments. 
 Additionally, CECL requires a reasonable and supportable forecast when establishing the ACL. The Company estimates losses over an approximate one-year forecast period using Moody s baseline economic forecasts, and then reverts to longer term historical loss experience over a three-year period. 
 The quantitative general allowance increased to 15.0 million at December 31, 2022, from 12.3 million at December 31, 2021, primarily due to the increase in loan volume in the portfolio and the impact of forecasted unemployment rate. 
 In addition to the quantitative analysis, a qualitative analysis is performed each quarter to provide additional general reserves on the loan portfolios not individually analyzed for various factors. The overall qualitative factors are based on nine sub-factors. The nine sub-factors have been aggregated into three qualitative factors: economic, environment and risk. 
 ECONOMIC 
 1) Changes in international, national and local economic business conditions and developments, including the condition of various market segments. 

2) Changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans. 

ENVIRONMENT 
 3) Changes in the nature and volume in the loan portfolio. 

4) The existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations. 

30 

5) Changes in lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off and recovery practices. 

6) Changes in the quality and breadth of the loan review process. 

7) Changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff. 

RISK 
 8) Changes in the trends of the volume and severity of delinquent and classified loans, and changes in the volume of non-accrual loans, TDRs, and other loan modifications. 

9) Changes in the political and regulatory environment. 

The qualitative analysis indicated a general reserve of 55.4 million at December 31, 2022, compared to 47.1 million at December 31, 2021. The increase was mainly due to changes in the economic environment as a result of inflation and global conditions. Management reviewed the overall economic, environmental and risk factors and determined that it was appropriate to make adjustments to these sub-factors based on that review. The Company s general reserve percentages for main loan segments, not otherwise classified, ranged from 0.67 for construction loans to 1.39 for home equity/improvement loans at December 31, 2022. 
 Under CECL, when loans are purchased with evidence of more than insignificant deterioration of credit, they are accounted for as purchase credit deteriorated PCD ). PCD loans acquired in a transaction are marked to fair value and a mark on yield is recorded. In addition, an adjustment is made to the ACL for the expected loss through retained earnings on the acquisition date. These loans are assessed on a regular basis and subsequent adjustments to the ACL are recorded on the income statement. On January 31, 2020, as a result of the merger of United Community Federal Corp. UCFC with and into Premier (the Merger ), the Company acquired PCD loans with a fair value of 79.1 million, a recorded adjustment on yield of 4.1 million and an increase to the ACL of 7.7 million. 
 As a result of the quantitative and qualitative analyses, along with the change in specific reserves and the increase in net charge-offs during the year, the Company s provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2022 was an expense of 12.5 million. This is compared to a recovery of 6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The ACL was 72.8 million at December 31, 2022, and 66.5 million at December 31, 2021. The ACL represented 1.13 of loans, net of undisbursed loan funds and deferred fees and costs at December 31, 2022, and 1.26 at December 31, 2021. In management s opinion, the overall ACL of 72.8 million as of December 31, 2022, was adequate to cover anticipated losses over the lifetime of the loans. 
 Management also assesses the value of OREO as of the end of each accounting period and recognizes write-downs to the value of that real estate in the income statement if conditions dictate. During the year ended December 31, 2022, there were 8,600 in write-downs of real estate held for sale. Management believes that the values recorded at December 31, 2022, for OREO and repossessed assets represent the realizable value of such assets. 
 Total classified loans decreased to 43.8 million at December 31, 2022, compared to 69.5 million at December 31, 2021, a decrease of 25.7 million, primarily due to improved asset quality. 
 The Company s ratio of ACL to non-performing loans was 215.3 at December 31, 2022, compared to 138.4 at December 31, 2021. Management monitors collateral values of all loans included on the watch list that are collateral dependent and believes that allowances for such loans at December 31, 2022, were appropriate. Of the 33.8 million in non-accrual loans at December 31, 2022, 4.9 million, or 14.4 , are less than 90 days past due. 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company had total non-performing assets of 34.4 million, compared to 48.2 million at December 31, 2021. Non-performing assets include loans that are on non-accrual, OREO and other assets held for sale. The OREO balance was 619,000 and 171,000 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 The net charge-offs and non-accrual loan balances as a percentage of total are presented in the table below at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Loans Acquired with Impairment 
 Under ASU Topic 326, when loans are purchased with evidence of more than insignificant deterioration of credit, they are accounted for as PCD. PCD loans acquired in a transaction are marked to fair value and a mark on yield is recorded. In addition, an adjustment is made to the ACL for the expected loss on the acquisition date. These loans are assessed on a regular basis and subsequent adjustments to the ACL are recorded on the income statement. 
 High Loan-to-Value Mortgage Loans 
 The majority of Premier s mortgage loans are collateralized by one-to-four-family residential real estate, have loan-to-value ratios of 80 or less, and are made to borrowers in good credit standing. The Bank usually requires residential mortgage loan borrowers whose loan-to-value is greater than 80 to purchase private mortgage insurance PMI ). Management also periodically reviews and monitors the financial viability of its PMI providers. 
 The Bank originates and retains a limited number of residential mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios that exceed 80 where PMI is not required if the borrower possesses other demonstrable strengths. The loan-to-value ratios on these loans are generally limited to 85 and exceptions must be approved by the Bank s Chief Credit Officer. Management monitors the balance of one-to-four family residential loans, including home equity loans and committed lines of credit that exceed certain loan to value standards (90 for owner occupied residences, 85 for non-owner occupied residences and one-to-four family construction loans, 75 for developed land and 65 for raw land). These loans are generally paying as agreed. 
 Premier does not make interest-only, first-mortgage residential loans, nor does it have residential mortgage loan products or other consumer products that allow negative amortization. 
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
 Goodwill was 318.0 million at December 31, 2022 compared to 317.9 million at December 31, 2021. This increase is a result of First Insurance acquiring Benham Insurance Associates, Inc. BIA ). Core deposit intangibles and other intangible assets decreased to 19.1 million at December 31, 2022, compared to 24.1 million at December 31, 2021, due to the recognition of 5.4 million of 
 32 

amortization partially offset by intangibles recorded as a part of the BIA acquisition. No impairment of goodwill was recorded in 2022 or 2021. 
 Deposits 
 Total deposits at December 31, 2022, were 6.9 billion compared to 6.3 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of 624.7 million, or 9.9 . Noninterest-bearing checking accounts grew by 144.7 million, interest-bearing checking accounts and money markets grew by 232.7 million, savings decreased by 6.4 million and retail certificates of deposit decreased by 109.9 million. Management can utilize the national market for certificates of deposit to supplement its funding needs if necessary. For more details on the deposit balances in general see Note 10 Deposits to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Borrowings 
 Premier had 428.0 million in FHLB advances or securities sold with agreements to repurchase at December 31, 2022 compared to no outstanding advances at December 31, 2021. This increase, along with an increase in deposits and a decrease in security balances, was used to fund the increase in loan balances in 2022. 
 Subordinated Debentures 
 Subordinated debentures were 85.1 million at December 31, 2022, compared to 85.0 million at December 31, 2021. In 2020, the Company issued 50.0 million aggregate principal amount fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due in 2030 in a private offering exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These notes carry a fixed rate of 4.00 for five years then a floating rate equal to the three-month SOFR rate plus 388.5 basis points. The Company may, at its option, redeem the notes, in whole or part, from time to time, subject to certain conditions, beginning on September 30, 2025. The net proceeds of the sale were approximately 48.8 million, after deducting the offering expenses. 
 Equity 
 Total stockholders equity decreased 135.8 million to 887.7 million at December 31, 2022, compared to 1.02 billion at December 31, 2021. The decrease in stockholders equity was primarily the result of a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income, which was primarily related to a 138.2 million negative valuation adjustment on the available-for-sale securities portfolio. Also contributing to the decline was the payment of 42.8 million of common stock dividends and the repurchase of 884,000 shares of common stock totaling 26.9 million. This was partially offset by the recording net income of 102.2 million. 
 Results of Operations 
 Summary 
 Premier reported net income of 102.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 126.1 million and 63.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. On a diluted per common share basis, Premier earned 2.85 in 2022, 3.39 in 2021 and 1.75 in 2020. The results for 2020 include eleven months of income and expenses from UCFC compared to twelve months in 2021 as well as 1.01 in Merger-related expense and additional provision cost as a result of the Merger and the adoption of CECL. 
 Net Interest Income 
 Premier s net interest income is determined by its interest rate spread (i.e., the difference between the yields on its interest-earning assets and the rates paid on its interest-bearing liabilities) and the relative amounts of average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 
 Net interest income was 242.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 227.4 million and 208.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The tax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.37 , 3.39 and 3.52 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The margin decreased 2 basis points between 2022 and 2021 primarily due to the sharp increase in interest rates and inversion of the yield curve which negatively impacted funding costs. Interest-earning asset yields increased 22 basis points (to 3.85 in 2022 from 3.63 in 2021) while the cost of interest- bearing liabilities between the two periods increased 34 basis points (to 0.68 in 2022 from 0.34 in 2021). 
 Total interest income increased by 34.1 million, or 14.0 , to 277.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from 243.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to an increase in loan and security income. Interest income from loans increased to 249.6 million for 2022 compared to 223.8 million in 2021, which represents an increase of 11.5 . The average balance of loans receivable increased 412.3 million to 5.89 billion for 2022, from 5.47 billion for 2021. The average yield on loans increased 15 basis points to 4.24 in 2022 from 4.09 in 2021. 
 During the same period, the average balance of investment securities increased to 1.26 billion in 2022 from 1.14 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. Interest income from investment securities increased to 26.1 million in 2022 compared to 19.4 million in 2021. 
 33 

Interest expense increased by 18.6 million to 34.8 million in 2022 compared to 16.2 million 2021. This increase was mainly due to a 26 basis point increase in the average cost of funds in 2022 and a 0.38 billion increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased 0.13 billion to 4.74 billion in 2022, from 4.61 billion in 2021. Interest expense related to interest-bearing deposits was 24.9 million in 2022 compared to 13.5 million in 2021. 
 Interest expense on FHLB advances was 6.6 million in 2022 and 23,000 in 2021. The increase in FHLB advance expense was due to increased utilization in 2022 as a result of increased loans. Interest expense recognized by the Company related to subordinated debentures was 3.3 million in 2022 and 2.7 million in 2021. 
 Total interest income increased by 5.6 million, or 2.4 , to 243.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from 237.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to an increase in securities income offset partly by a decrease in loans income. Interest income from loans decreased to 223.8 million for 2021 compared to 225.1 million in 2020, which represents a decrease of 0.6 . The average balance of loans receivable increased 249.3 million to 5.47 billion for 2021, from 5.22 billion for 2020. However, the average yield on loans decreased 0.22 to 4.09 in 2021 from 4.31 in 2020. 
 During the same period, the average balance of investment securities increased to 1.14 billion in 2021 from 0.54 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of increasing deposits and decreasing loans. Interest income from investment securities increased to 19.4 million in 2021 compared to 11.5 million in 2020. 
 Interest expense decreased by 13.7 million to 16.2 million in 2021 compared to 19.9 million 2020. This decrease was mainly due to a 28 basis point decrease in the average cost of funds in 2021 offset by a 0.42 billion increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased 0.56 billion to 4.61 billion in 2021, from 40.5 billion in 2020. Interest expense related to interest-bearing deposits was 13.5 million in 2021 compared to 26.9 million in 2020. 
 Interest expense on FHLB advances was 23,000 in 2021 and 1.7 million in 2020. The decrease in FHLB advance expense was due to lower utilization in 2021 as a result of increased deposits. Interest expense recognized by the Company related to subordinated debentures was 2.7 million in 2021 and 1.3 million in 2020, with the increase primarily due to the recognition of a full year of expense in 2021 compared to a partial year in 2020.

(1) Interest on certain tax exempt loans and tax-exempt securities in 2022, 2021 and 2020 is not taxable for Federal income tax purposes. In order to compare the tax-exempt yields on these assets to taxable yields, the interest earned on these assets is adjusted to a pre-tax equivalent amount based on the marginal corporate federal income tax rate of 21 . 

(2) Interest rate spread is the difference in the yield on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. 

(3) Net interest margin is net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets excluding average unrealized gains/losses. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures discussion above for further details. 

(4) For the purpose of the computation for loans, non-accrual loans are included in the average loans outstanding. 

(5) Securities yield = annualized interest income divided by the average balance of securities, excluding average unrealized gains/losses. 

See Non-GAAP Financial Measure discussion above for further details. 
 The following table describes the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest-related assets and liabilities have affected Premier s tax-equivalent interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (change in volume multiplied by prior year rate), (ii) change in rate (change in rate multiplied by prior year volume), and (iii) total change in rate and volume. The combined effect of changes in both rate and volume has been allocated proportionately to the change due to rate and the change due to volume.

Provision for credit losses Premier s provision for credit losses was an expense of 14.3 million, a recovery of 7.1 million and an expense of 44.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The increase in provision for 2020 included 25.9 million related to acquisition accounting under CECL for the Merger with the remaining increase generally due to the larger loan portfolio post-Merger and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease for 2021 is primarily due to improved conditions as the economy and credit environment recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in 2022 was mainly due to the increase in volume in loans. 
 Provisions for credit losses are charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for credit losses to a level deemed appropriate by management to absorb anticipated losses over the life of the loan. Factors considered by management include identifiable risk in the portfolios, historical experience, the volume and type of lending conducted by Premier, the amount of non-performing loans, the amount of loans graded by management as substandard, doubtful, or loss, general economic conditions (particularly as they relate to Premier s market areas) and other factors related to the collectability of Premier s loan portfolio. See also Allowance for Credit Losses in this Management s Discussion and Analysis and Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Noninterest Income Noninterest income decreased by 17.2 million, or 21.6 , to 62.2 million in 2022 primarily due to a decrease in mortgage banking income and losses on securities. Noninterest income decreased by 465,000, or 0.6 , in 2021 to 79.3 million down from 79.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 Service fees and other charges increased to 25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from 24.2 million for 2021 and from 22.1 million in 2020. The increase in service fees and other charges in 2022 is primarily due to increased customer activity for interchange and ATM/NSF charges. 
 Noninterest income also includes gains, losses and impairment on investment securities. In 2022, Premier recognized 550,000 of securities losses compared to 4.2 million in security gains in 2021 and 1.6 million in gains in 2020. 
 Mortgage banking income includes gains from the sale of mortgage loans, fees for servicing mortgage loans for others, an offset for amortization of mortgage servicing rights, and adjustments for impairment in the value of mortgage servicing rights. Mortgage banking income totaled 9.9 million, 21.9 million and 28.2 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The 12.1 million decrease in 2022 from 2021 is primarily attributable to a decrease in the gain on sale of loans of 10.7 million offset partly by a 2.5 million benefit from lower mortgage servicing rights amortization. Premier originated less residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market in 2022 compared with 2021 as long term interest rates stabilized resulting in less refinance activity. The balance of the mortgage servicing right valuation allowance was 687,000 at the end of 2022. 
 The 6.3 million decrease in mortgage banking income in 2021 from 2020 was primarily attributable to a decrease in the gain on sale of loans of 19.9 million offset partly by a 13.8 million positive change in the valuation adjustments on mortgage servicing rights. Premier originated less residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market in 2021 compared with 2020 as long term interest 
 36 

rates stabilized resulting in less refinance activity. The balance of the mortgage servicing right valuation allowance was 2.7 million at the end of 2021. 
 Gains on the sale of non-mortgage loans, which include SBA and FSA loans, totaled 0 in 2022 compared to 0 in 2021 and 324,000 in 2020. Fluctuations in the volume of eligible SBA loans were the reasons for the difference in income year to year to year. 
 Insurance commission income increased to 16.2 million in 2022, up 448,000 from 15.8 million in 2021 primarily due to higher new/renewal commissions. Insurance commission income decreased to 15.8 million in 2021, down 1.0 million from 16.8 million in 2020 primarily due to lower contingent commissions. 
 Income from bank owned life insurance BOLI decreased 1.2 million in 2022 to 3.9 million down from 5.1 million in 2021 primarily due to 1.1 million of claim gains recognized in 2021. Income in 2020 was 3.3 million. 
 Wealth income decreased 199,000 to 5.8 million in 2022 from 6.0 million in 2021. Wealth income decreased 132,000 to 6.0 million in 2021 from 6.2 million in 2020. 
 Other noninterest income decreased to 984,000 in 2022 compared to 2.1 million in 2021 primarily due to a 1.3 million non-recurring settlement payment in 2021. Other noninterest income increased to 2.1 million in 2021 compared to 1.9 million in 2020 . 
 Noninterest Expense Total noninterest expense for 2022 was 164.5 million compared to 157.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and 164.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase from 2021 is primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits and other non-interest expense partially offset by a decrease in occupancy. 
 Compensation and benefits increased 6.8 million, or 7.5 , to 97.4 million in 2022 from 90.6 million in 2021. The increase is mainly related to higher staffing levels for growth initiatives and higher base compensation including mid-year adjustments. Occupancy expense decreased 1.5 million, to 14.0 million in 2022 compared to 15.5 million in 2021 and other noninterest expenses increased 1.6 million to 26.1 million in 2022 from 24.4 million in 2021. 
 Compensation and benefits increased 13.4 million, or 17.4 , to 90.6 million in 2021 up from 77.2 million in 2020. The increase is mainly related to increased staffing, merit increases and increases in health care. Occupancy expense decreased 819,000 to 15.5 million in 2021 compared to 16.3 million in 2020 and data processing expense decreased 1.1 million to 13.6 million in 2021 from 14.7 million in 2020. Other noninterest expenses increased 1.8 million to 25.1 million in 2021 from 23.3 million in 2020. 
 Income Taxes Income taxes totaled 24.1 million in 2022 compared to 30.4 million in 2021 and 16.2 million in 2020. The effective tax rates for those years were 19.1 , 19.4 , and 20.4 , respectively. The tax rate is lower than the statutory 21 tax rate for the Company mainly because of investments in tax-exempt securities. The earnings on tax-exempt securities are not subject to federal income tax. See Note 17 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. 
 Concentrations of Credit Risk 
 Financial institutions such as Premier generate income primarily through lending and investing activities. The risk of loss from lending and investing activities includes the possibility that losses may occur from the failure of another party to perform according to the terms of the loan or investment agreement. This possibility is known as credit risk. 
 Lending or investing activities that concentrate assets in a way that exposes the Company to a material loss from any single occurrence or group of occurrences increases credit risk. Diversifying loans and investments to prevent concentrations of risks is one way a financial institution can reduce potential losses due to credit risk. Examples of asset concentrations would include multiple loans made to a single borrower and loans of inappropriate size relative to the total capitalization of the institution. Management believes adherence to its loan and investment policies allows it to control its exposure to concentrations of credit risk at acceptable levels. As of December 31, 2022. Premier s loan portfolio was concentrated geographically in its northeast, northwest and central Ohio, northeast Indiana, and southeast Michigan market areas. Management has also identified lending for income-generating rental properties within commercial real estate as an industry concentration. Total loans for income-generating rental property totaled 2.4 billion at December 31, 2022, which represents 33.4 of the Company s loan portfolio. Management believes it has the skill and experience to manage any risks associated with this type of lending. Loans in this category are generally paying as agreed without any unusual or unexpected levels of delinquency. The delinquency rate in this category, which is any loan 30 days or more past due, was 0.01 at December 31, 2022. There are no other industry concentrations that exceed 10 of the Company s loan portfolio. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company s primary source of liquidity is its core deposit base, raised through the Bank s branch network, along with wholesale sources of funding and its capital base. These funds, along with investment securities, provide the ability to meet the needs of depositors while funding new loan demand and existing commitments. 
 37 

Cash (used in) generated from operating activities was 180.1 million, 165.9 million and 55.6) million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by or used in operations during the periods presented consist primarily of proceeds from the sale of loans (less the origination of loans held for sale), the provision for credit losses, depreciation expense, the origination, amortization and impairment of mortgage servicing rights and increases and decreases in other assets and liabilities. The negative cash from operating activities in 2020 was primarily due to the Company s decision to originate and sell construction loans held for sale for the first time. Due to the time it takes to complete the construction and sell the loans, the cash used in the origination of loans held for sale greatly exceeded the proceeds from the sale of loans held for sale. Since this is strictly a timing difference, the Company was comfortable paying out dividends on its common stock in 2020 even with the negative cash provided by operating activities. 
 The primary investing activity of Premier is lending and the purchase of available-for-sale securities, which are funded with cash provided from operating and financing activities, as well as proceeds from payment on existing loans and proceeds from maturities of investment securities. The net cash used for investing activities was 1.2 billion, 333.5 million and 541.9 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 Principal financing activities include the gathering of deposits, the utilization of FHLB advances, and the sale of securities under agreements to repurchase such securities and borrowings from other banks. The net cash provided by financing activities was 993.4 million, 169.9 million and 625.5 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For additional information about cash flows from Premier s operating, investing and financing activities, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and related Notes included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 At December 31, 2022, Premier had the following commitments to fund deposits, borrowing obligations, leases and post-retirement benefits:

To meet its obligations management can adjust the rate of savings certificates to retain deposits in changing interest rate environments; it can sell or securitize mortgage and non-mortgage loans; and it can turn to other sources of financing including FHLB advances, the Federal Reserve, and brokered certificates of deposit. At December 31, 2022, Premier had additional borrowing capacity of 1.1 billion under its agreements with the FHLB. 
 The Bank is subject to various capital requirements. At December 31, 2022, the Bank had capital ratios that exceeded the standard to be considered well capitalized. For additional information about Premier and the Bank s capital requirements, see Note 16 Regulatory Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Premier has established various accounting policies that govern the application of GAAP in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements. The significant accounting policies of Premier are described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management, which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management, actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates, which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of Premier. 
 Allowance for credit losses - Premier believes the allowance for credit losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements. In determining the appropriate estimate for the allowance for credit losses, management considers a number of factors relative to both specific credits in the loan portfolio and macro-economic factors relative to the economy of the U.S. as a whole and the economies of the areas in which the Company does business. 
 38 

Factors relative to specific credits that are considered include a customer s payment history, a customer s recent financial performance, an assessment of the value of collateral held, knowledge of the customer s character, the financial strength and commitment of any guarantors, the existence of any customer or industry concentrations, changes in a customer s competitive environment and any other issues that may impact a customer s ability to meet his obligations. 
 Economic factors that are considered include levels of unemployment and inflation, GDP growth, Federal Reserve stimulus and broad global and national economic conditions. 
 In addition to the identification of specific customers who may be potential credit problems, management considers its historical losses, the results of independent loan reviews, an assessment of the adherence to underwriting standards, and other factors in providing for credit losses that have not been specifically classified. Management believes that the level of its allowance for credit losses is sufficient to cover the current expected credit losses. Refer to Allowance for credit losses in this Management s Discussion and Analysis and Note 2 - Statement of Accounting Policies for a further description of the Company s estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for credit losses. 
 Goodwill and Intangibles - Premier has two reporting units: the Bank and First Insurance. At December 31, 2022, Premier had goodwill of 318.0 million, including 295.6 million in the Bank and 22.4 million in First Insurance. The carrying value of goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if it is determined appropriate. The evaluation for impairment involves comparing the current estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the current estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no additional testing is required and impairment loss is not recorded. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, further valuation procedures are performed and could result in impairment of goodwill being recorded. Further valuation procedures would include allocating the estimated fair value to all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value. If the implied value of goodwill of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. 
 Premier evaluated goodwill as of December 31, 2022 and resulted in no additional testing or impairment. If, for any future period Premier determines that there has been impairment in the carrying value of goodwill balances, Premier will record a charge to earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on net income, but not risk-based capital ratios. 
 Premier has core deposit and other intangible assets resulting from acquisitions which are subject to amortization. Premier determines the amount of identifiable intangible assets based upon independent core deposit and customer relationship analyses at the time of the acquisition. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. No events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying amount of any identifiable intangible assets may not be recoverable had occurred during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Asset/Liability Management 
 A significant portion of the Company s revenues and net income is derived from net interest income and, accordingly, the Company strives to manage its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities to generate an appropriate contribution from net interest income. Asset and liability management seeks to control the volatility of the Company s performance due to changes in interest rates. The Company attempts to achieve an appropriate relationship between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities. 
 Premier monitors interest rate risk on a quarterly basis through simulation analysis that measures the impact changes in interest rates can have on net interest income. The simulation technique analyzes the effect of a presumed 100 basis point shift in interest rates (which is consistent with management s estimate of the range of potential interest rate fluctuations) and takes into account prepayment speeds on amortizing financial instruments, loan and deposit volumes and rates, borrowings, derivative positions and non-maturity deposit assumptions and capital requirements. It should be noted that other areas of Premier s income statement, such as gains from sales of mortgage loans and amortization of mortgage servicing rights are also impacted by fluctuations in interest rates, but are not considered in the simulation of net interest income. 
 The table below presents, for the twelve months subsequent to December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, an estimate of the change in net interest income that would result from an immediate, parallel change in interest rates over the entire yield curve, relative to the measured base case scenario of a static balance sheet. The Company did not complete an earnings at risk analysis for the down 300 basis point or down 400 basis point scenarios at December 31, 2021 due to the level of interest rates.

The results of all the simulation scenarios are within the Board mandated guidelines as of December 31, 2022. Management reviews the Board policy limits in all scenarios to determine if they are adequate and if any changes should be made to Board mandated guidelines. 
 In addition to the simulation analysis, the Bank also prepares an economic value of equity EVE analysis. This analysis generally calculates the net present value of the Bank s assets and liabilities in rate shock environments that range from 400 basis points to +400 basis points. The results of this analysis are reflected in the following table.

In evaluating the Bank s exposure to interest rate risk, certain shortcomings inherent in each of the methods of analysis presented must be considered. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market rates while interest rates on other types of financial instruments may lag behind current changes in market rates. Furthermore, in the event of changes in rates, prepayments and early withdrawal levels could differ significantly from the assumptions in calculating the table and the results therefore may differ from those presented.

Item 8.	Financial Statemen ts and Supplementary Data 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 The management of Premier Financial Corp. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 
 1. Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

2. Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 

3. Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Based on our evaluation under the framework in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 Crowe LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued a report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, is included in this Item 8.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 
 Premier Financial Corp. 
 Defiance, Ohio 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Premier Financial Corp. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO . 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans Receivable ACL Qualitative Factors 
 As described in Notes 2 and 6 to the financial statements, the Company recognizes expected losses expected to be incurred over the contractual lives of financial assets carried at amortized cost, including loans receivable, using the Current Expected Credit Losses CECL methodology. The ACL was 72,816,000 at December 31, 2022, and consists of two components: a specific reserve based on the analysis of individually evaluated loans, and a general reserve which represents current expected credit losses on loans sharing common risk characteristics general reserve ). The general reserve includes amounts from both a quantitative and a qualitative analysis. The Company has segregated the portfolio into segments with similar risk characteristics and generally uses two methodologies, discounted cash flow and probability of default/loss given default, to determine the quantitative factors. 
 Determination of the qualitative factors, which are added to the quantitative factors to adjust the general reserve for the current environment, incorporates subjective factors, including economic, environmental and other risk factors. The incorporation of qualitative factors added 55,351,000 to the ACL as of December 31, 2022. We have identified auditing the qualitative factors as a critical audit matter as management s determination of the qualitative factors is subjective and involves significant management judgments; and our audit procedures related to certain of the qualitative factors involved a high degree of auditor judgment and required significant audit effort, including the need to involve more experienced audit personnel. 
 The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: 
 
 Testing the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the evaluation of the support used to estimate the qualitative factors, including controls addressing: 

o Management s review of the relevance and reliability of data inputs used as the basis for the qualitative factors. 

o Management s review of the reasonableness of significant judgments and assumptions used to develop the qualitative factors. 

o Management s review of the mathematical accuracy of the qualitative factors calculation. 

Substantively testing management s determination of the qualitative factors, including evaluating their judgments and assumptions including: 

o Testing management s process for developing the qualitative factors and assessing the relevance and reliability of data used to develop the adjustments, including evaluating their significant judgments and assumptions for reasonableness. Among other procedures, our evaluation considered evidence from internal and external sources and whether significant judgments and assumptions were applied consistently from period to period. 

o Analytically evaluating the qualitative factors for directional consistency and reasonableness. 

o Testing the mathematical accuracy of the qualitative factors used in the general reserve.

million and million, respectively, at the FHLB of Cincinnati. 
 
 , the Company adopted ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, as amended, which replaced the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss CECL methodology. The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables and held-to-maturity debt securities. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor in accordance to Topic 842 on leases. In addition, ASC 326 made changes to the accounting for available-for-sale debt securities. The Company adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for financial assets purchased with credit deterioration that were previously classified as purchased credit impaired PCI and accounted for under ASC 310-30. In accordance with the standard, management did not reassess whether PCI assets met the criteria of PCD assets as of the date of adoption. As a part of the merger, the Bank recognized million of the allowance for credit losses related to PCD loans. The remaining noncredit discount (based on the adjusted amortized cost basis) will be accreted into interest income at the effective interest rate as of the merger date. Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity of payoff are reported at amortized cost. Amortized cost is the principal balance outstanding, net of purchase premiums and discounts, adjustments, and deferred loan fees and costs. Accrued interest receivable was reported in other assets and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, nature or volume of the Company s financial assets, changes in experience in staff, as well as changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates, property values and other external factors, such as regulatory, legal and technological environments. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis and included in the collective evaluation. A loan is individually analyzed when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loans agreement. Loans, for which terms have been modified and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings. When a loan is considered individually analyzed, an analysis of the net present value of estimated cash flows is performed and an allowance may be established based on the outcome of that analysis, or if the loan is deemed to be collateral dependent an allowance is established based on the fair value of collateral. All modifications are reviewed by the bank s Chief Credit Officer or Chief Credit Administration Officer to determine whether or not the modification constitutes a troubled debt restructure. Commercial and commercial real estate loan relationships greater than are individually evaluated. If a loan is individually analyzed, a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported net of the allowance allocation which is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Loan relationships less than are aggregated by loan segment and risk level and given a specific reserve based on the general reserve factor for that loan segment and risk level. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as consumer and residential real estate loans, are collectively evaluated, and accordingly, they are not separately identified for disclosure. Troubled Debt Restructurings TDR ): A loan for which terms have been modified resulting in a concession, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, is considered to be a TDR. The allowance for credit loss on a TDR is measured using the same method as all other loans held for investment, except when the value of a concession is measured using the discounted cash flow method, the allowance for credit loss is determined by discounting the expected future cash flow at the original interest rate of the loan. If a TDR is considered to be a collateral dependent loan, the loan is reported, net, at the fair value of the collateral. For TDRs that subsequently default, the Company determines the amount of the allowance on that loan in accordance with the accounting policy for the allowance for credit losses on loans individually identified. The Company incorporates recent historical experience related to TDRs including the performance of TDRs that subsequently default into the calculation of the allowance by loan portfolio segment. See Footnote 6 Loans for further discussion on TDRs. 
 requires servicing rights to be amortized into noninterest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying loans, driven, generally, by changes in market interest rates. Servicing assets are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to carrying amount. Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into groupings based on predominant risk characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type, loan terms, year of origination and investor type. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual grouping, to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount. If the Company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular grouping, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as an increase to income. Changes in valuation allowances are reported within mortgage banking income on the income statement. The fair values of servicing rights are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of changes in estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses. Servicing fee income, which is reported on the income statement with mortgage banking income, is recorded for fees earned for servicing loans. The fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal, or a fixed amount per loan, and are recorded as income when earned. The amortization of mortgage servicing rights is netted against loan servicing fee income. Servicing fees totaled million, million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. Late fees and ancillary fees related to loan servicing are not material.

Total assets of First Insurance at December 31, 2022 , were of total assets. First Insurance does not meet any of the quantitative thresholds of FASB ASC Topic 280. Accordingly, all of the financial service operations are considered by management to be aggregated in one reportable segment.

 million in 2022 , million in 2021 and million in 2020. Income from services charges on deposit accounts is included in service fees and other charges in noninterest income. 

 Interchange income - this represents fees earned from debit and credit cardholder transactions. Interchange fees from cardholder transactions represent a percentage of the underlying transaction value and are recognized daily, concurrent with the transaction processing services provided to the cardholder. Interchange fees were million in 2022 , million in 2021 and million in 2020, which are reported net of network related charges. Interchange income is included in service fees and other charges in noninterest income. 

 Wealth management income - this represents monthly fees due from wealth management customers as consideration for managing the customers assets. Wealth management and trust services include custody of assets, investment management, escrow services, and fees for trust services and similar fiduciary activities. Revenue is recognized when our performance obligation is completed each month, which is generally the time that payment is received. Also included are fees received from a third party broker-dealer as part of a revenue-sharing agreement for fees earned from customers that we refer to the third party. These fees are paid to us by the third party on a quarterly basis and recognized ratably throughout the quarter as our performance obligation is satisfied. Revenues from wealth management were million, million and million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in in total noninterest income. 

 Gain/loss on sales of other real estate owned OREO - the Company records a gain or loss from the sale of OREO when control of the property transfers to the buyer, which generally occurs at the time of an executed deed. When the Company finances the sale of OREO to the buyer, the Company assesses whether the buyer is committed to perform their obligations under the contract and whether collectability of the transaction price is probable. Once these criteria are met, the OREO asset is derecognized and the gain or loss on sale is recorded upon the transfer of control of the property to the buyer. In determining the gain or loss on the sale, the Company adjusts the transaction price and related gain or loss on sale if a significant financing component is present. Income from the gain/loss on sales of OREO were gains of and in 2022 and 2021 , and losses of in 2020. Income from the gain or loss on sales of OREO is included in total noninterest income.

did have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment: Issued in January 2017, ASU 2017-04 simplifies the manner in which an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity, prior to the amendments in ASU 2017-04, had to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities, including unrecognized assets and liabilities, in accordance with the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. However, under the amendments in ASU 2017-04, an entity should perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, with the understanding that the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, ASU 2017-04 removes the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if it fails such qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. became effective for the Company on , and the amendments of this ASU were applicable to the goodwill impairment testing for 2020. ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments: Issued in June 2016, ASU 2016-13 will add FASB ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses and finalizes amendments to FASB ASC Subtopic 825-15, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses. The amendments of ASU 2016-13 are intended to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information related to expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit by replacing the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to determine credit loss estimates. The amendments of ASU 2016-13 eliminate the probable initial recognition threshold and, in turn, reflect an entity s current estimate of all expected credit losses. ASU 2016-13 does not specify the method for measuring expected credit losses, and an entity is allowed to apply methods that reasonably reflect its expectations of the credit loss estimate. The amendments of , and all subsequent ASUs issued by FASB to provide additional guidance and clarification related to this Topic, became effective for the Company on . As a result of adopting the amendments of ASU 2016-13, the Company recorded an increase to its allowance for credit losses of million and an increase to its allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures of million resulting in a one-time cumulative effect adjustment through retained earnings of million net of million tax at the date of adoption. This adjustment included a qualitative adjustment to the allowance for credit losses related to loans and an allowance on off-balance sheet credit exposures. The Company estimates losses over an approximate forecast period using Moody s baseline economic forecasts, and then reverts to longer term historical loss experience over a period. ASU No. 2020-04: Reference Rate Reform Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (Topic 848): O n March 12, 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-4, Reference Rate Reform ASC 848 ): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. ASC 848 contains optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contract modifications and hedging relationships, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another reference rates expected to be discontinued. The Company has formed a cross-functional project team to lead the transition from LIBOR to adoption of alternative reference rates which include Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), American Interbank Offered Rate Ameribor ), and Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index BSBY ). The Company identified loans that renewed prior to 2021 and obtained updated reference rate language at the time of renewal. Additionally, management is utilizing the timeline guidance published by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee to develop and achieve internal milestones during this transitional period. Additionally, the Company has adhered to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol that was released on October 23, 2020. The Company discontinued the use of new LIBOR-based loans by December 31, 2021, according to regulatory guidelines. On December 21, 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rare Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset of Date of Topic 848, which extends the sunset date of ASC Topic 848, Reference Rate Reform, to December 31, 2024. 
 Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted ASU No. 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures: On March 30, 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures which will eliminate troubled debt restructuring TDR accounting for entities that have adopted ASU 2016-13, the current expected credit loss CECL model and will add new vintage disclosures for gross write-offs. The elimination of TDR accounting can be adopted either prospectively for loan modifications after adoption or on a modified retrospective basis that would result in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings in the period of adoption. ASU 2022-02 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company does not anticipate any material effect on the Company upon adoption.

Quarterly, the Company evaluates if any security has a fair value less than its amortized cost. Once these securities are identified, in order to determine whether a decline in fair value resulted from a credit loss or other factors, the Company performs further analysis as outlined below: Review the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost and observe the security s lowest credit rating as reported by third-party credit ratings companies. 

 Any security that has a loss rate greater than , credit rating below investment grade or not rated by a third-party credit ratings company would be subjected to additional analysis that may include, but is not limited to: changes in market interest 

 rates, changes in securities credit ratings, security type, service area economic factors, financial performance of the issuer/or obligor of the underlying issue and third-party guarantee. 

 If the Company determines that a credit loss exists, the credit portion of the allowance will be measured using a DCF analysis using the effective interest rate as of the security s purchase date. The amount of credit loss the Company records will be limited to the amount by which the amortized cost exceeds the fair value. As of December 31, 2022, management had determined that no credit loss exists. 

 In 2022 and 2021, management determined there was OTTI. Net realized gains from the sales of investment securities totaled after tax), million million after tax) and million million after tax) in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

 Troubled Debt Restructurings As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , the Company had a recorded investment in TDRs of million and million, respectively. The Company allocated and of specific reserves to those loans at December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively, and committed to lend additional amounts totaling up to and at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company offers various types of concessions when modifying a loan, however, forgiveness of principal is rarely granted. Each TDR is uniquely designed to meet the specific needs of the borrower. Commercial loans modified in a TDR often involve temporary interest-only payments, term extensions, and converting revolving credit lines to term loans. Additional collateral or an additional guarantor is often requested when granting a concession. Commercial real estate loans modified in a TDR often involve temporary interest-only payments, re-amortization of remaining debt in order to lower payments, and sometimes reducing the interest rate lower than the current market rate. Residential mortgage loans modified in a TDR are comprised of loans where monthly payments are lowered, either through interest rate reductions or principal only payments for a period of time, to accommodate the borrowers financial needs, interest is capitalized into principal, or the term and amortization are extended. Home equity modifications are made infrequently and usually involve providing an interest rate that is lower than the borrower would be able to obtain due to credit issues. All retail loans where the borrower is in bankruptcy are classified as TDRs regardless of whether or not a concession is made. Of the loans modified in a TDR, million are on non-accrual status and partial charge-offs have in some cases been taken against the outstanding balance. Loans modified as a TDR may have the financial effect of increasing the allowance associated with the loan. If the loan is determined to be collateral dependent, the estimated fair value of the collateral, less any selling costs is used to determine if there is a need for a specific allowance or charge-off. If the loan is determined to be cash flow dependent, the allowance is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s pre-modification effective interest rate.

The TDRs that subsequently defaulted described above increased the allowance by for the year ended December 31, 2022. A default for purposes of this disclosure is a TDR loan in which the borrower is 90 days contractually past due under the modified terms. In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed regarding the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. Credit Quality Indicators Loans are categorized into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. Loans are analyzed individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis includes all non-homogeneous loans, such as commercial and commercial real estate loans and certain homogenous mortgage, home equity and consumer loans. This analysis is performed on a quarterly basis. Premier uses the following definitions for risk ratings with loans not meeting such classifications being considered unclassified : Special Mention. Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution's credit position at some future date. Substandard. Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful. Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Not Graded. Loans classified as not graded are generally smaller balance residential real estate, home equity and consumer installment loans which are originated primarily by using an automated underwriting system. These loans are monitored based on their delinquency status and are evaluated individually only if they are seriously delinquent. Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be pass rated loans.

Allowance for Credit Losses ACL The Company has adopted ASU 2016-13 (Topic 326 Credit Losses) to calculate the ACL, which requires a projection of credit loss over the contract lifetime of the credit adjusted for prepayment tendencies. This valuation account is deducted from the loans amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loan. The ACL is adjusted through the provision for credit losses and reduced by net charge offs of loans. The credit loss estimation process involves procedures that consider the unique characteristics of the Company s portfolio segments. These segments are further disaggregated into the loan pools for monitoring. When computing allowance levels, a model of risk characteristics, such as loss history and delinquency status, along with current conditions and a supportable forecast is used to determine credit loss assumptions. The Company is generally utilizing two methodologies to analyze loan pools: discounted cash flows DCF and probability of default/loss given default PD/LGD ). A default can be triggered by one of several different asset quality factors including past due status, non-accrual status or if the loan has had a charge-off. The PD/LGD utilizes charge off data from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council to construct a default rate. The Company estimates losses over an approximate one-year forecast period using Moody s baseline economic forecasts, and then reverts to longer term historical loss experience over a three-year period. This default rate is further segmented based on the risk of the credit assigning a higher default rate to riskier credits. The DCF methodology was selected as the most appropriate for loan segments with longer average lives and regular payment structures. The DCF model has two key components, the loss driver analysis combined with a cash flow analysis. The contractual cash flow is adjusted for PD/LGD and prepayment speed to establish a reserve level. The prepayment studies are updated quarterly by a third-party for each applicable pool. The remaining life method was selected for the consumer loan segment since the pool contains loans with many different structures and payment streams and collateral. The weighted average remaining life uses an average annual charge-off rate applied to the contractual term, further adjusted for estimated prepayments to determine the unadjusted historical charge-off rate for the remaining balance of assets.

 Loss Drivers 

According to the accounting standard an entity may make an accounting policy election not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivable if the entity writes off the applicable accrued interest receivable balance in a timely manner. The Company has made the accounting policy election not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables for all loan segments. Current policy dictates that a loan will be placed on nonaccrual status, with the current accrued interest receivable balance being written off, upon the loan being 90 days delinquent or when the loan is deemed to be collateral dependent and the collateral analysis shows less than 1.2 times discounted collateral coverage based on a current assessment of the value of the collateral. In addition, ASC Topic 326 requires the Company to establish a liability for anticipated credit losses for unfunded commitments. To accomplish this, the company must first establish a loss expectation for extended (funded) commitments. This loss expectation, expressed as a ratio to the amortized cost basis, is then applied to the portion of unfunded commitments not considered unilaterally cancelable, and considered by the company s management as likely to fund over the life of the instrument. At December 31, 2022, the Company had billion in unfunded commitments and set aside million in anticipated credit losses. This reserve is recorded in other liabilities as opposed to the ACL. The determination of ACL is complex and the Company makes decisions on the effects of factors that are inherently uncertain. Evaluations of the loan portfolio and individual credits require certain estimates, assumptions and judgments as to the facts and circumstances related to particular situations or credits. There may be significant changes in the ACL in future periods determined by prevailing factors at that point in time along with future forecasts.

Purchased Credit Deteriorated Loan Under ASU Topic 326, when loans are purchased with evidence of more than insignificant deterioration of credit, they are accounted for as PCD. PCD loans acquired in a transaction are marked to fair value and a mark on yield is recorded. In addition, an adjustment is made to the ACL for the expected loss on the acquisition date. These loans are assessed on a regular basis and subsequent adjustments to the ACL are recorded on the income statement.

The Company tests goodwill at least annually and, more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be more likely than not that there is a possible impairment. The Company conducted a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment at December 31, 2022. The impairment assessment compared the fair value of identified reporting units with their carrying amount (including goodwill). If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The Company's assessment estimated fair value on an income approach that incorporated a discounted cash flow DCF model that involves management assumptions based upon future growth projections. Results of the assessment indicated no goodwill impairment as of December 31, 2022. The Company will continue to monitor its goodwill for possible impairment. Acquired Intangible Assets

The realization of the Company s deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company s ability to generate taxable income in future periods and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities during the same period. The Company has evaluated the available evidence supporting the realization of its deferred tax assets and determined it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized and thus valuation allowance was required at December 31, 2022. Retained earnings at December 31, 2022 , include approximately million for which no tax provision for federal income taxes has been made. This amount represents the tax bad debt reserve at December 31, 1987, which is the end of the Company s base year for purposes of calculating the bad debt deduction for tax purposes. If this portion of retained earnings is used in the future for any purpose other than to absorb bad debts, the amount used will be added to future taxable income. The unrecorded deferred tax liability on the above amount at December 31, 2022 , was approximately million. The total amount of interest and penalties recorded in the income statement was for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 . The amount accrued for interest and penalties was at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in the states of Indiana and West Virginia. The Company is no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for years before 2019. At December 31, 2022, the Company also operated in the states of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan, which tax financial institutions based on their equity rather than their income. 

 million will be carried forward to use against future taxable income. The net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in the year ending December 31, 2029 . This tax benefit is subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382; however, Premier and the Bank expect to utilize the full amount of the benefit.

A description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is set forth below. Available-for-sale securities - Securities classified as available for sale are generally reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs where the Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service that uses matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs). The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows and the bonds terms and conditions, among other things. Securities in Level 2 include U.S. federal government agencies, mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds and municipal securities. Equity securities These securities are reported at fair value utilizing Level 1 inputs where the Company obtains quoted prices in active markets for identical equity securities. Loans held for sale, carried at fair value The Company has elected the fair value option for all loans held for sale originated after January 31, 2020. Collateral Dependent loans - Fair values for individually analyzed, collateral dependent loans are generally based on appraisals obtained from licensed real estate appraisers and in certain circumstances consideration of offers obtained to purchase properties prior to foreclosure. Appraisals for commercial real estate generally use three methods to derive value: cost, sales or market comparison and income approach. The cost method bases value on the cost to replace the current property. Value of market comparison approach evaluates the sales price of similar properties in the same market area. The income approach considers net operating income generated by the property and an investor s required return. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Comparable sales adjustments are based on known sales prices of similar type and similar use properties and duration of time that the property has been on the market to sell. Such adjustments made in the appraisal process are typically significant and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Real estate held for sale - Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. These assets are then reviewed monthly by members of the asset review committee for valuation changes and are accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals which may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including cost, comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments may be significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Appraisals for both collateral-dependent loans and other real estate owned are performed by certified general appraisers (for commercial properties) or certified residential appraisers (for residential properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by the Company. Once received, a member of the Company s asset quality or collections department reviews the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal. Appraisal values are discounted from to to account for other factors that may impact the value of collateral. In determining the value of collateral dependent loans and other real estate owned, significant unobservable inputs may be used, which include but are not limited to: physical condition of comparable properties sold, net operating income generated by the property and investor rates of return. Mortgage servicing rights - On a quarterly basis, mortgage servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to the carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an individual tranche exceeds fair value, impairment is recorded on that tranche so that the servicing asset is carried at fair value. Fair value is determined at a tranche level based on a model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The valuation model utilizes assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income and are validated against available market data (Level 2). Mortgage banking derivative - The fair value of mortgage banking derivatives are evaluated monthly based on derivative valuation models using quoted prices for similar assets adjusted for specific attributes of the commitments and other observable market data at the valuation date (Level 2). Interest rate swaps The Company periodically enters into interest rate swap agreements with its commercial customers who desire a fixed rate loan term that is longer than the Company is willing to extend. The Company then enters into a reciprocal swap agreement with a third party that offsets the interest rate risk from the interest rate swap extended to the customer. The interest rate swaps are derivative instruments which are carried at fair value on the statement of financial condition. The Company uses an independent third party that performs a market valuation analysis for both swap positions. (Level 2) The Company also enters into cash flow hedge derivatives instruments to hedge the risk of variability in cash flows (future interest payments) attributable to changes in the contractually specified LIBOR benchmark interest rate on the Company's floating rate loan pool. The Company uses an independent third party to perform a market valuation analysis for these derivatives (Level 2).

The Company has elected the fair value option for new applications taken post January 31, 2020, and subsequently originated for residential mortgage and permanent construction loans held for sale. These loans are intended for sale and the Company believes that fair value is the best indicator of the resolution of these loans. Interest income is recorded based on the contractual terms of the loan and in accordance with the Company s policies. The aggregate fair value of the residential mortgage loans held for sale at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was million and million, respectively and they had contractual balances of million and million, respectively. The difference between these two figures is recorded in gains and losses on the sale of loans held for sale. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 , million was recorded in losses on the sale of loans held for sale for the change in fair value. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 , million was recorded in gain on sale of loans held for sale for the change in fair value. The aggregate fair value of the permanent construction loans held for sale at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was million and million and they had a contractual balance of million and million, respectively. The difference between these two figures is recorded in gains and losses on the sale of loans held for sale. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 , million was recorded in losses on the sale of loans held for sale for the change in fair value. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 , million was recorded in gains on the sale of loans held for sale for the change in fair value.

Individually analyzed loans, which are evaluated using the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans, had a fair value of million that includes a valuation allowance of million and a fair value of million that includes a valuation allowance of million at December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. A provision recovery of million and provision expense of million, million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to these loans was included in earnings. Mortgage servicing rights, which are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, had a fair value of million with a valuation allowance of and a fair value of million with a valuation allowance of million at December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. A recovery of and million and an expense of million was included in earnings for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Real estate held for sale is determined using Level 3 inputs which include appraisals and are adjusted for changes in market conditions. There was change in fair value of real estate held for sale for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Much of the information used to arrive at fair value is highly subjective and judgmental in nature and therefore the results may not be precise. Subjective factors include, among other things, estimated cash flows, risk characteristics and interest rates, all of which are subject to change. With the exception of investment securities, the Company s financial instruments are not readily marketable and market prices do not exist. Since negotiated prices for the instruments, which are not readily marketable, depend greatly on the motivation of the buyer and seller, the amounts that will actually be realized or paid per settlement or maturity of these instruments could be significantly different. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, as a result of their short-term nature, is considered to be equal to fair value and are classified as Level 1. It was not practicable to determine the fair value of FHLB stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability. The Company uses an exit price income approach to determine the fair value of the loan portfolio. The model utilizes a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of the loans using assumptions for the coupon rates, remaining maturities, prepayment speeds, projected default probabilities, losses given defaults, and estimates of prevailing discount rates. The discounted cash flow approach models the credit losses directly in the projected cash flows. The model applies various assumptions regarding credit, interest, and prepayment risks for the loans based on loan types, payment types and fixed or variable classifications. For all periods presented, the estimated fair value of individually analyzed loans is based on the fair value of the collateral, less estimated cost to sell, or the present value of the loan s expected future cash flows (discounted at the loan s effective interest rate). All individually analyzed loans are classified as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy. The fair value of noninterest-bearing deposits are considered equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., carrying value) and are classified as Level 1. The fair value of savings, NOW and certain money market accounts are equal to their carrying amounts and are a Level 1 classification. Fair values of fixed rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits resulting in a Level 2 classification. The fair values of securities sold under repurchase agreements are equal to their carrying amounts resulting in a Level 1 classification. The fair value of subordinated debentures are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on subordinated debentures to the schedule of maturities on the subordinated debt tranches resulting in a Level 2 classification. FHLB advances with maturities greater than 90 days are valued based on discounted cash flow analysis, using interest rates currently being quoted for similar characteristics and maturities resulting in a Level 2 classification.

Interest Rate Swaps The Company maintains an interest rate protection program for commercial loan customers. Under this program, the Company provides a customer with a fixed rate loan while creating a variable rate asset for the Company by the customer entering into an interest rate swap with terms that match the loan. The Company offsets its risk exposure by entering into an offsetting interest rate swap with an unaffiliated institution. The Company had interest rate swaps associated with commercial loans with a notional value of million and fair value of million in other assets and million in other liabilities at December 31, 2022 . The difference in fair value of between the asset and liability represents a credit valuation adjustment that flows through noninterest income. Interest Rate Swap Designated as Cash Flow Hedge In May 2021, the Company entered into derivative instruments designated as a cash flow hedge. For a derivative instrument that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, the change in fair value of the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. An interest rate swap with notional amount totaling million as of December 31, 2021 was designated as a cash flow hedge to hedge the risk of variability in cash flows (future interest receipts) attributable to changes in the contractually specified LIBOR benchmark interest rate on the Company s floating rate loan pool and was determined to be highly effective during the period. The Company is receiving a fixed rate of and paying one month LIBOR. The maturity date of this interest rate swap is May 2031 . The gross aggregate fair value of the swap of million is recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2022, with changes in fair value recorded net of tax in other comprehensive income (loss). The Company expects the hedge to remain highly effective during the remaining terms of the swap.)

Exhibit 4.1 
 Description of Premier Financial Corp. Capital Stock 
 As of December 31, 2022, Premier Financial Corp., an Ohio corporation Premier Financial, the Company, we, or our ), had one class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended: Common Stock, par value 0.01 per share Common Shares ). 
 Effective January 31, 2020, Premier Financial s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the Articles were adopted. The Articles authorize 80,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of 75,000,000 Common Shares, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, 0.01 par value Preferred Shares ). Premier Financial has no Preferred Shares issued or outstanding. 
 The following summary is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the Articles, and Premier Financial s Amended and Restated Code of Regulations, as well as the applicable provisions of Chapters 1701, 1704 and 1707 of the Ohio Revised Code. For a complete description of the terms and provisions of our Common Shares, refer to the Articles and the Regulations, both of which are filed as exhibits to Premier Financial s Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Common Shares 
 Voting Rights 
 Holders of Common Shares are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on each matter submitted to a vote of shareholders. Our Common Shares do not have cumulative voting rights for the election of directors. Unless otherwise provided in the Articles or the Regulations, a majority of votes cast by shareholders at a meeting is sufficient to pass on any matter before the shareholders. 
 Board of Directors 
 Our Board of Directors Board is divided into three classes (Class I, Class II and Class III), elected for staggered three-year terms. Our Regulations provide that the Board consist of 13 directors: (i) Donald Hileman, John Bookmyer and five other persons who served as directors of Premier Financial or Premier Bank (formerly First Federal Bank of the Midwest) immediately prior to the effective time of the merger of Premier Financial with United Community Financial Corp. (the Merger on January 31, 2020 (the Premier Financial related directors and (ii) Gary Small, Richard Schiraldi, and four other persons who served as directors of United Community Financial Corp. or Home Savings Bank immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (the UCFC related directors ). If, prior to April 1, 2023, any of the initial Class I, II or III directors ceases to serve as a director for any reason or does not stand for reelection, the vacancy will be filled by 
 the Board with an individual selected by the UCFC related directors (if such director was a UCFC related director) or the Premier Financial related directors (if such director was a Premier Financial related director) in good faith in a manner intended to preserve the principles of representation in 
 
 the Regulations, provided that such individual is reasonably agreeable to the Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board in accordance with the good faith execution of its duties. 
 Dividends 
 The Board may, at any regular or special meeting, declare dividends on our outstanding capital stock. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property or in our capital stock. 
 Premier Financial s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is primarily dependent on its receipt of dividends from Premier Bank Premier Bank and its other subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve expects Premier Financial to serve as a source of strength for Premier Bank and may require Premier Financial to retain capital for further investment in Premier Bank, rather than pay dividends to Premier Financial shareholders. Payment of dividends by Premier Financial or Premier Bank may be restricted at any time at the discretion of its applicable regulatory authorities if they deem such dividends to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. These provisions could have the effect of limiting Premier Financial's ability to pay dividends on its common shares. 
 Premier Bank must have the approval of the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions if the payment of a cash dividend in any year would cause the total dividends for that year to exceed the total of Premier Bank s net income for the current year and the retained net income of Premier Bank for the preceding two years. Payments of dividends by Premier Bank may be restricted at any time at the discretion of Premier Bank s governing regulatory authorities if such regulatory authorities deem such dividends to constitute unsafe and/or unsound banking practices or if necessary to maintain adequate capital. 
 The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by financial holding companies and other bank holding companies. The policy statement provides that, as a matter of prudent banking, a financial holding company or a bank holding company should not maintain a rate of cash dividends on common stock unless its net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends, and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the financial holding company s or bank holding company s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Accordingly, a financial holding company or a bank holding company should not pay dividends that exceed its net income or can only be funded in ways that weaken the financial holding company's or bank holding company s financial health, such as by borrowing. In addition, Premier Financial may not pay dividends that would cause Premier Financial to fail to satisfy the capital adequacy regulations applicable to bank holding companies which qualify as financial holding companies, including having a capital conservation buffer that is greater than 2.5 . 
 
 No Preemptive Rights 
 No shareholder of the Company shall have, as a matter of right, the preemptive right to purchase or subscribe for shares of any class, now or hereafter authorized, or to purchase or subscribe for securities or other obligations convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or which by warrants or otherwise entitle the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase any such shares. 
 Share Repurchases by the Company 
 
 We have the right, but not the obligation, to repurchase our common shares from our shareholders. 
 Preferred Shares 
 Our 5,000,000 authorized but unissued preferred shares are typically referred to as blank check preferred shares. This term refers to preferred shares for which the rights and restrictions are determined by the board of directors of a corporation at the time the preferred shares are issued. Under our Articles, our Board has the authority, without any further shareholder vote or action, to issue the preferred shares in one or more series, from time to time, with full or limited voting power, or without voting power, and with all designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and privileges of, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions upon, the preferred shares, as may be provided in the amendment or amendments to our Articles adopted by our Board. The authority of our Board includes, but is not limited to, the determination or fixing of the following with respect to a particular series of preferred shares: the distinctive serial designation and the number of shares constituting such series; the voting rights, full, conditional or limited, of shares of such series; the dividend rates or the amount of dividends to be paid on the shares of such series, whether dividends shall be cumulative and, if so, from which date or dates, the payment date or dates for dividends, and the participating or other special rights, if any, with respect to dividends; the amount or amounts payable upon the shares of such series in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company; whether the shares of such series shall be entitled to the benefits of a sinking or retirement fund to be applied to the purchase or redemption of such shares, and, if so entitled, the amount of such fund and the manner of its application, including the price or prices at which such shares may be redeemed or purchased through the application of such funds; whether the shares of such series shall be convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or classes or any other series of the same or any other class or classes of stock of the Company and, if so convertible or exchangeable, the conversion price or prices, or the rates or rates of exchange, and the adjustments thereof, if any, at which such conversion or exchange may be made, and any other terms and conditions of such conversion or exchange; the price or other consideration for which the shares of such series shall be issued; restrictions, if any, on the issuance of shares of the same series or any other class or series; and whether the shares of such series shall be redeemable and, if so, the 
 
 price or prices at which, and the terms and conditions upon which such shares may be redeemed; and such other rights, preferences and limitations as shall not be inconsistent with our Articles, our Regulations or Ohio law.

The control share acquisition statute provides, in essence, that any person acquiring shares of an issuing public corporation (which Premier Financial meets by definition) in any of the following three ownership ranges must seek and obtain shareholder approval of the acquisition transaction that first puts such ownership within each such range: (i) one-fifth or more but less than one-third; (ii) one-third or more but less than a majority; and (iii) a majority or more. 
 The control share acquisition statute applies not only to traditional offers but also to open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions and original issuances by an Ohio corporation, whether friendly or unfriendly. The procedural requirements of the control share acquisition statute could render approval of any control share acquisition difficult because it must be authorized at a special meeting of shareholders, for which the statutorily prescribed form of notice has been given and at which the statutorily prescribed quorum is present, by the affirmative vote of the majority of the voting power of the corporation in the election of directors represented at the meeting and by a majority of the portion of such voting power, excluding the voting power of interested shares. 
 A corporation may elect not to be covered by the provisions of the control share acquisition statute by the adoption of an appropriate amendment to its articles of incorporation or its regulations. We have not adopted such an amendment. Our Articles, as currently in effect, provide that Section 1701.831 of the Ohio Revised Code applies to control share acquisitions of shares of Premier Financial. 
 Ohio Revised Code Chapter 1704 is a merger moratorium statute. The merger moratorium statute provides that, unless a corporation s articles of incorporation otherwise provide, an issuing public corporation (which Premier Financial meets by definition) may not 

engage in a Chapter 1704 transaction for three years following the date on which a person acquires more than 10 of the voting power in the election of directors of the issuing corporation, unless the Chapter 1704 transaction is approved by the corporation s board of directors prior to such transaction. A person who acquires such voting power is an interested shareholder, and Chapter 1704 transactions involve a broad range of transactions, including mergers, consolidations, combinations, liquidations, recapitalizations and other transactions between an issuing public corporation and an interested shareholder if such transactions involve at least 5 of the aggregate fair market value of the assets or shares of the issuing public corporation or assets representing at least 10 of its earning power or income. After the initial three-year moratorium, Chapter 1704 prohibits such transactions absent approval by disinterested shareholders or the transaction meeting certain statutorily defined fair price provisions. 
 A corporation may elect not to be covered by the provisions of Ohio Revised Code Chapter 1704 by the adoption of an appropriate amendment to its articles of incorporation. We have not adopted such an amendment. Our Articles, as currently in effect, provide that Ohio Revised Code Chapter 1704 applies to Premier Financial. 
 
 Ohio also has enacted Ohio Revised Code Section 1707.043, which provides that a person who announces a control bid with respect to an Ohio corporation that has issued and outstanding shares listed on a national securities exchange (which Premier Financial does with our common shares) must disgorge profits realized by that person upon the sale of any equity securities within 18 months of the announcement. 
 In addition, Section 1701.59 of the Ohio Revised Code provides that, in determining what a director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation, such director may consider, in addition to the interests of the corporation s shareholders, any of the interests of the corporation s employees, suppliers, creditors and customers, the economy of the State of Ohio and the United States, community and societal considerations and the long-term as well as the short-term interests in the corporation and its shareholders, including the possibility that these interests may be best served by the continued independence of the corporation. 
 The overall effect of the statutes described above may be to render more difficult or discourage the removal of incumbent management of an Ohio corporation or the assumption of effective control of an Ohio corporation by other persons.

(the Company maintains this Executive Short Incentive Plan (the STIP to identify the specific performance related objectives required for the payout of short term cash incentives for the benefit of certain key executives of the Company and the Company s subsidiaries. An award under the STIP (each a STIP Award is designed to align an individual s compensation with the success of the Company based upon the achievement of certain performance measures at the end of the performance period. The STIP and all STIP Awards are administered and overseen by the Compensation Committee (the Committee of the Board of Directors of Premier Financial Corp. 
 
 The individuals eligible to receive an award under the STIP will be determined by the Company, or by the Committee with respect to the CEO and any other officers covered by Rule 16a-1(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Executive Officers ), from time to time. 
 
 Target and Actual Awards and Form of Payout: 
 
 A STIP Award will be communicated to each participant through an individual statement prepared by the CEO or Chief Human Resources Officer setting forth the applicable Corporate Performance Goals (as defined below), the specific threshold/target/maximum performance levels for each Corporate Performance Goal, the performance period, the recipient s Target STIP Award (as defined below), the portion of the Target STIP Award attributable to the Corporate Performance Goals, and the portion of the Target STIP Award attributable to the participant s individual performance goals. 
 
 A Target STIP Award will be identified at the time of grant and is determined as a percentage of the recipient s base salary. 
 
 A performance period under the STIP will be the 12 month period beginning on January 1 of the year in which the award is issued and ending on December 31 of that year. 
 
 Following the end of each applicable performance period, the Committee will certify performance results relative to the level of achievement of the Corporate Performance Goals for all participants. The date the Committee certifies the performance results is referred to as the Certification Date. At the Committee s discretion, the performance levels relating to STIP Awards may be calculated without regard to extraordinary items or adjusted, as the Committee deems equitable, in recognition of unusual or non-recurring events affecting the Company or its subsidiaries or changes in applicable tax laws or accounting principles. 
 
 With respect to the CEO and Executive Officers, on or before the Certification Date, the Committee will (1) assess the CEO s performance and determine and approve the level of attainment by the CEO of the CEO s individual performance goals established by the Committee, and (2) with respect to all other Executive Officers, review the annual assessment conducted by the CEO of each Executive Officer s personal performance compared to their individual performance goals. The CEO, or the CEO s delegate, will approve all levels of personal performance compared to individual performance goals for any participant in the STIP who is not an Executive Officer. 
 1 

STIP Awards will be paid out as Actual Awards based upon the attainment of the Corporate Performance Goals and individual performance goals. The Committee will approve the Actual Award to be paid to the CEO and each Executive Officer. The CEO, or the CEO s delegate, will approve the Actual Award to be paid to any participant in the STIP who is not an Executive Officer. Following the determination of the Actual Award, each participant will receive a written confirmation of the Actual Award, setting forth the level of achievement of all goals and the amount of the Actual Award. 
 
 The Actual Award will be paid in cash as soon as practicable, but not later than March 15 of the year following the end of the applicable performance period. 
 
 Performance Measures, Weightings, Goals and Payout Calibration: 
 
 For each performance period, the Committee will identify the applicable performance measures (the Corporate Performance Goals to be applied. 
 
 For each performance period, the Committee will identify the relative weighting and the target performance level required to receive 100 of the award opportunity associated with each applicable Corporate Performance Goal. The Committee will also establish (1) a threshold performance level the attainment of which will result in a 50 payout of the award opportunity for the applicable Corporate Performance Goal, and (2) a maximum performance level the attainment of which will result in a 150 payout of the award opportunity for the applicable Corporate Performance Goal. Payouts for performance between threshold and target levels, or between target and maximum levels, will be interpolated. If the threshold performance level is not attained for a Corporate Performance Goal, no payout will be made with respect to that Corporate Performance Goal. No payout will exceed 150 of the award opportunity for a Corporate Performance Goal even if performance exceeds the stated maximum performance level. Each Corporate Performance Goal will be assessed separately and may result in the payment of an Actual Award regardless of whether the other Corporate Performance Goals have been achieved.

 The performance measures are: 
 
 3-year average core ROA will be weighted 50 and be evaluated relative to Peer Group (defined below) performance; and 

3-year relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) will be weighted 50 and be evaluated relative to the Peer Group. 

The table below sets forth the two performance measures, their respective weighting, how performance on each measure will be evaluated (relative to peers or relative to plan) and the goals for threshold performance, target performance and superior performance. Achievement of the threshold performance goal will result in 50 of the target payout for the respective measure, achievement of the target performance goal will result in 100 of target payout for the respective measure, and achievement of the superior performance goal will result in 150 of the target payout for the measure. Payouts for performance between threshold and target, or between target and superior, will be interpolated.

 3-year Average Core ROA: Core return on average assets or Core ROA means the return on average assets adjusted for merger related costs and expenses. Core ROA is determined for each member of the Peer Group for each annual period and then averaged to determine the Average Core ROA for each member of the Peer Group. 

3-year Total Shareholder Return: Total Shareholder Return represents the stock price appreciation measured by comparing each Peer Group member s 20 day average stock price prior to the start of the first calendar year of the Performance Period, with each member s 20 day average stock price at the end of the third calendar year of the Performance Period, plus reinvested dividends throughout the Performance Period. 

The Committee maintains flexibility and discretion to amend, modify, terminate or otherwise adjust the Plan, as necessary, including, but not limited to, adjusting measure definitions, if such adjustments ensure a better comparison relative to the peer group and more appropriately reflect the goals of the LTIP and the Company s compensation philosophy.

(ii) to pay income tax at source on wages imposed under Section 3401 of the Code as a result of such payment and the payment of the additional income tax at source on wages imposed under Section 3401 of the Code attributable to the additional Section 3401 wages and taxes; provided however, the accelerated payment amount shall not exceed the aggregate of the State, Local and Foreign Tax Amount and the income tax withholding related to such amount. 

(f) Certain Offsets . Payment may be accelerated to satisfy a debt of the Participant to the Company or an Affiliate incurred in the ordinary course of the service relationship between the Company and the Participant; provided, however, the amount accelerated shall not exceed Five Thousand Dollars 5,000) and the payment shall be made at the same time and in the same amount as the debt otherwise would have been due and collected from the Participant. 

(g) Bona Fide Disputes as to Right to Payment . Payment may be accelerated where the payment is part of a settlement between the Company or an Affiliate and the Participant of an arm s length, bona fide dispute as to the Participant s right to the deferred amount. 

(h) Unforeseeable Emer g ency . Payment may be accelerated for an Unforeseeable Emergency, subject to the rules and restrictions set forth in Section 10.2. 

10.2 Unforeseeable Emergency. The Committee may direct the Company to accelerate payment of all or a portion of the Participant s vested Account in accordance with Section 10.1(h) if the Committee, in its sole discretion, determines that the Participant has incurred an Unforeseeable Emergency, based on the relevant facts and circumstances and in accordance with Treas. Reg. 1.409A-3(i)(3), provided the following rules and restrictions are satisfied. 

(a) Application for Payment . A Participant may request, in the manner prescribed by the Committee, payment of all or a portion of the Participant s Account in the event the Participant incurs an Unforeseeable Emergency. The Participant must provide appropriate written evidence to substantiate the existence of the Unforeseeable Emergency and the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need consistent with the provisions of this Plan.

2/23/23, 9:32 AM 
 EX-10.1 

(b) Limitation on Amount of Pa yment. The Plan must limit the amount of any payment based on Unforeseeable Emergency to the amount that is reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need, which may include amounts necessary to pay any Federal, state or local income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated result from the payment. However, the Committee in determining necessity may disregard amounts available as a hardship distribution or a loan from a qualified plan or as an unforeseeable emergency distribution from another nonqualified plan. In no event may the amount of the payment exceed the value of the Participant s Account. 

(c) Exhaustion of Other Sources of Pa yment. The Plan may not make payment to the extent that the Unforeseeable Emergency may be relieved: 

(i) through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise; or (ii) by liquidation of the Participant s assets to the extent that such liquidation of assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship; or (iii) by the Participant s cessation of Corrective Deferrals under the Plan. 
 (d) Pa yment from Participant s Account. Payment shall be paid in a single lump sum payment from the Participant s Account by first reducing the Participant s Corrective Deferrals for the current Taxable Year, then by reducing the remaining Account until the value covers the amount of the emergency need. Payment generally will be made within 90 days following the Committee s approval of the Participant s Unforeseeable Emergency Payment request. If that 90-day period spans more than one Taxable Year of the Participant, the Participant will not have any discretion over the Taxable Year of payment. 

(e) Treatment of Pa yment. Neither a Participant s request or failure to request an Unforeseeable Emergency payment, nor the Committee s acceptance or rejection of such a request, constitutes a Re-deferral Election. 

The Committee s determination of whether payment may be accelerated in accordance with this Section 10 shall be made in accordance with Treas. Reg. 
 Section 1.409A-3(j)(4). 
 
 11. Section 162(m) of the Code . 

If the Committee reasonably anticipates that if a payment were made as scheduled under the Plan it would result in a loss of the Employer s tax deduction due to the application of Section 162(m) of the Code, such payment can be delayed and paid (a) during the Participant s first Taxable Year in which the Committee reasonably anticipates that the Employer s tax deduction will not be limited or eliminated by the application of Section 162(m) of the Code or 
 (b) subject to Section 9.5, during the period beginning with the Participant s Separation from Service and ending on the later of the last day of the Employer s Taxable Year in which the
