PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

BUSINESS OF U.S. PREMIUM BEEF, LLC 

Overview 

USPB s mission is to increase the
quality of beef and long-term profitability of cattle producers by creating a fully integrated producer-owned beef processing system that
is a global supplier of high quality, value-added beef products responsive to consumer desires. USPB operates an integrated cattle processing
and beef marketing enterprise where consumer and processor demands and requirements are implemented through changes in genetics, feeding,
and management. USPB s unitholders benefit from its supplier alliance with NBP through (i) premiums received in excess of cash market
prices for higher quality cattle, (ii) allocations of profits and potential distributions, (iii) potential unit price appreciation, and
(iv) information that permits unitholders to make informed production decisions. 

Products and Production 

Ownership in USPB provides unitholders
access to an integrated cattle production, processing and marketing system. As the basis of that system, USPB s Class A unitholders
have a guaranteed right plus an obligation (on a one head per Class A unit per delivery year basis) to deliver cattle to USPB, pursuant
to the Uniform Cattle Delivery and Marketing Agreement (see Cattle Delivery Arrangements ). USPB facilitates the delivery of cattle
to NBP for processing and subsequent product distribution and marketing. Shortly after the cattle are processed, cattle suppliers receive,
at no extra charge, individual animal carcass data previously considered proprietary by many processors. This carcass data assists producers
in refining production methodologies, thereby improving the product quality and subsequently enhancing the return to the producer. 

We believe the primary advantage of
USPB s ownership in NBP centers around USPB s ability to provide NBP with a consistent supply of quality beef from a known
source, allowing NBP to target higher margin value-added markets. Consumers have historically demonstrated their willingness and desire
to buy branded products that offer better value in other consumer product markets, with the Certified Angus Beef product
line being an example in the beef industry. 

Cattle Producers Uniform Cattle Delivery and Marketing
Agreements 

USPB facilitates the delivery of cattle
from its Class A unitholders and associates to NBP. Each Class A unitholder is required to enter into a Uniform Cattle Delivery and Marketing
Agreement (Delivery Agreement) with the Company whereby the unitholder is committed to deliver a designated number of cattle on an annual
basis. Each Class A unit held by a unitholder entitles and obligates that unitholder to deliver one head of cattle per delivery year to
USPB. The Delivery Agreements are for a term of 5 years with an evergreen renewal provision that automatically renews annually
in the beginning of USPB s delivery year for a subsequent five-year period. These arrangements are described in greater detail in
 Cattle Delivery Arrangements . 

Company Background 

USPB was originally organized as a tax-exempt
cooperative within the meaning of Section 521(b)(l) of the Internal Revenue Code. The cooperative began operations on December 1,
1997, when the cooperative acquired its initial interest in Farmland National Beef, now known as National Beef Packing Company, LLC. In
connection with the cooperative s purchase of its interest in Farmland National Beef, the cooperative owned the right and was subject
to the obligation to deliver cattle annually to NBP. Under that arrangement, USPB has delivered more than 16.6 million head of cattle
to NBP for processing since it commenced deliveries. 

4 

On August 6, 2003, USPB became the majority
owner in NBP. 

On August 18, 2004, the shareholders
of U.S. Premium Beef, Ltd. approved the conversion of the cooperative into a Delaware LLC. 

On December 5, 2011, USPB entered into
a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with Leucadia National Corporation (Leucadia Transaction). The Purchase Agreement provided for
Leucadia to purchase 56.2415 of the membership interests in NBP (National Interests) from the Company for approximately 646.8 million.
The Leucadia Transaction closed on December 30, 2011. Following the close, USPB owned 15.0729 of NBP s membership interests. 

On November 29, 2019, Jefferies Financial
Group, Inc. Jefferies , formerly Leucadia National Corporation) sold its remaining ownership interest in NBP to a combination
of NBM US Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation owned by Marfrig Global Foods S.A.; NBPCo Holdings, LLC; and TMK Holdings, LLC. USPB
elected to not participate in the acquisition and, as a result, USPB s ownership interest in National Beef remained at 15.0729 . 

Employees 

USPB has seven employees as of December
31, 2022. The complexity of USPB s obligations under its various contracts with NBP require USPB to retain the services of key senior
management personnel with the experience, skill and expertise necessary to manage an enterprise competitive with other sophisticated participants
in the beef and meat industries. Each employee is compensated through the payment of a base salary with management being eligible for
incentive and discretionary bonuses. In addition, each employee is eligible to participate in benefits programs maintained by USPB. These
programs include group medical insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance and similar programs. 

 USPB s employees are not unionized
and USPB believes that its relationship with its employees is good. 

Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters 

The Company does not operate any processing
facilities itself and is therefore not subject to federal and state regulations relating to grading of animals, quality control, labeling,
sanitary control and waste disposal. Operational activities are conducted through NBP and significant efforts with respect to governmental
and environmental regulation are conducted by NBP. See Business of National Beef Packing Company, LLC - Regulation and Environmental . 

Sales, Marketing, and Customers 

NBP is the only beef processor with which
USPB has a cattle delivery agreement. The ultimate customers of and the market for the products resulting from the processing of cattle
supplied by USPB s unitholders and associates are described in Business of National Beef Packing Company, LLC . 

Beef Industry, Markets, and Competition 

As indicated above, USPB s business
activities are focused on facilitating the delivery of cattle produced by its Class A unitholders and associates to NBP. Information regarding
the beef industry, the market for beef and beef products and competition within the beef industry are described in Business of National
Beef Packing Company, LLC . 

Intellectual Property 

USPB maintains a federally registered
trademark on a U.S. Premium Beef logo that it uses periodically. 

5 

Research and Development 

USPB does not conduct any research and
development activities. 

CATTLE DELIVERY ARRANGEMENTS 

Cattle Producers Uniform Cattle Delivery and Marketing
Agreements and Payments to Unitholders and Associates for Cattle 

USPB facilitates the delivery of cattle
from its Class A unitholders and associates to NBP. Each Class A unitholder is required to enter into a Uniform Cattle Delivery and Marketing
Agreement (Delivery Agreement) with the Company whereby the unitholder is committed to deliver a designated number of cattle on an annual
basis. Each Class A unit held by a unitholder entitles and obligates that unitholder to deliver one head of cattle per delivery year to
USPB. The Delivery Agreements are for a term of 5 years with an evergreen renewal provision that automatically renews annually
in the beginning of USPB s delivery year for a subsequent five-year period. 

USPB s Class A unitholders and
associates deliver cattle to NBP for processing (NBP is the only beef processor that USPB has a cattle delivery agreement with). The resulting
beef and beef products are marketed by NBP. Each unitholder or associate is paid for the cattle delivered to NBP based on a market-based
purchase price that is subject to the agreements between USPB and NBP. 

Pursuant to the Uniform Cattle Delivery
and Marketing Agreement, payment for cattle is based on the individual carcass quality of cattle delivered. As a limited liability company,
allocations of profits and losses and potential distributions are not tied to cattle delivery, but rather to the number of Class A and
Class B units held and the respective rights of those units. 

BUSINESS OF NATIONAL BEEF PACKING COMPANY, LLC 

General 

NBP is one of the largest beef processing
companies in the U.S., accounting for approximately 14 of fed cattle slaughter in the U.S. NBP processes and markets fresh and
chilled boxed beef, ground beef, beef by-products, consumer-ready beef and pork, and wet blue leather for domestic and international markets.
Based in Kansas City, Missouri, NBP had approximately 10,200 employees on December 24, 2022 and generated total revenues of 11.9 billion
in 2022. 

The largest part of NBP s
revenue is generated from the sale of boxed beef and beef by-products. NBP also generates revenues from value-added production of
consumer-ready products. In addition, NBP operates one of the largest hide tanning facilities in the world, selling wet blue
leather to tanners that produce finished leather for the automotive, luxury goods, apparel and furniture industries. Other
revenue streams include sales of portioned beef and other products directly to consumers through internet, direct mail and direct
response television by its subsidiary, Kansas City Steak Company, LLC, and service revenues generated by National Carriers,
Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary that is one of the largest refrigerated and livestock carrier operations in the U.S. and transports
products for NBP and a variety of other customers. NBP s profitability typically fluctuates seasonally as well as cyclically,
based on the availability of fed cattle. 

Beef Processing 

NBP s profitability is dependent,
in large part, on the spread between its cost for fed cattle, the primary raw material for its business, and the value received from selling
boxed beef and beef by-products coupled with its overall volume. NBP operates in a commodity market, and it does not have much influence
over the price it pays for cattle or the selling price it receives for the products it produces. NBP s profitability typically
fluctuates seasonally and cyclically with relatively higher margins in the spring and summer months and during times of ample cattle availability. 

Revenues in 2022 increased approximately
2 in comparison to 2021, primarily due to an increase in selling price per unit and volume. FY2022 included 53 weeks of activity while
FY2021 included 52 weeks. Cost of sales increased by approximately 16 in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was due primarily to
increased cattle prices and an increase in the costs for labor, packaging and supplies. Lower gross margin per head and higher costs led
to lower profitability in 2022 as compared to 2021. 

Revenues in 2021 increased approximately
24 in comparison to 2020, primarily due to an increase in the average selling price of beef products, cattle weights and number of cattle
processed. Cost of sales increased by approximately 14 in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase is due primarily to higher volumes,
increased cattle weights and an increase in the average price of fed cattle. The combined effects of increased margin per head and an
increase in volume led to higher profitability in 2021 as compared to 2020. 

6 

Sales and Marketing 

NBP markets its products to
national and regional retailers, including supermarket chains, independent grocers, club stores, wholesalers and distributors,
foodservice providers and further processors. In addition, NBP sells beef by-products to the medical, feed processing,
fertilizer and pet food industries. NBP exported products to 36 countries; in 2022, export sales represented approximately 12 
of revenues. The demand for beef is generally strongest in the spring and summer months and decreases during the winter months. 

NBP emphasizes the sale of higher-margin,
value-added products, which include branded boxed beef, consumer-ready beef and pork, portion-control beef and wet blue hides. NBP
believes its value-added products can command higher prices than commodity products because of its ability to consistently meet product
specifications, based on quality, trim, weight, size, breed or other factors, tailored to the needs of its customers. In addition
to the value-added brands that NBP owns, it licenses the use of Certified Angus Beef , a registered trademark of Certified
Angus Beef LLC, and Certified Hereford Beef , a registered trademark of Certified Hereford Beef LLC. 

Raw Materials and Procurement 

The primary raw material for the beef
processing plants is fed cattle. Fed cattle prices change daily based on supply and demand for beef and other proteins, cattle inventory
levels relative to packer demand for cattle, weather and other factors. NBP has two beef processing facilities located in southwest Kansas
and a third beef processing plant in central Iowa. The primary market area for the purchase of cattle for those facilities includes Kansas,
Texas, Nebraska, Iowa and Oklahoma. A significant portion of USPB s unitholders and associates are located in this area. The close
proximity of NBP s facilities to large supplies of cattle gives its buyers the ability to visit feedlots on a regular basis, which
enables NBP to develop strong working relationships with its suppliers, reduce its reliance on any one cattle supplier and lower in-bound
transportation costs. 

On June 10, 2019, USPB entered into
the First Amended and Restated Cattle Purchase and Sale Agreement with NBP (Amended Agreement). Per the terms and conditions of
the Amended Agreement, NBP is required to purchase from USPB Class A unitholders, and USPB is required to cause to be sold and delivered
from its Class A unitholders to NBP, a base amount of 735,385 (subject to adjustment) head of cattle per year. In fiscal years 2022, 2021,
and 2020, USPB elected to increase the number of cattle that its Class A unitholders could deliver during USPB s delivery year by
up to 10 . During fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, USPB s Class A unitholders and associates provided approximately 23 of NBP s
total cattle requirements, under the Amended Agreement. The purchase price for the cattle is determined by pricing grids, which, at all
times, are required to be no less favorable than any other pricing grid being utilized by NBP and the pricing grid shall be competitive
with NBP s major competitors for the purchase of cattle. The terms and conditions of the Amended Agreement are substantially the
same as the previous agreement except in the following material ways: 

Under the Amended Agreement, if NBP acquires or develops new processing (slaughter) facilities, then
USPB has a first right to provide 25 of the cattle to the new NBP facility. 

The purchase price of cattle delivered by USPB Class A unitholders to the Tama, Iowa processing facility
shall be no less favorable than any other pricing grid that NBP offers to any other seller of cattle delivering to the Tama, Iowa processing
facility or to non-grid cattle with comparable performance. 

On each anniversary of the Amended Agreement, the term of the Amended Agreement shall be extended for
five years from the date of such anniversary, unless either party elects to not extend the term. The Amended Agreement currently extends
through June 10, 2026. 

NBP also purchased additional cattle
from certain USPB members and associates outside of the Amended Agreement. 

7 

Processing Facilities 

NBP owns two beef processing facilities
located in Liberal and Dodge City, Kansas, which can each process approximately 6,000 cattle per day and a third beef processing facility
in Tama, Iowa which can process approximately 1,200 head per day. NBP s three consumer-ready facilities are in Hummels Wharf, Pennsylvania,
Moultrie, Georgia and Kansas City, Kansas. Its ground beef patty facility is in North Baltimore, Ohio, and its tannery is in St. Joseph,
Missouri. 

Competition 

Competitive conditions exist both in the
purchase of fed cattle, as well as in the sale of beef products. Beef products compete with other protein sources, including pork
and poultry, but NBP s principal competition comes from other beef processors. NBP believes the principal competitive factors
in the beef processing industry are price, quality, food safety, customer service, product distribution, technological innovations (such
as food safety interventions and packaging technologies) and brand loyalty. Some of NBP s competitors have substantially larger
beef operations, greater financial and other resources and wider brand recognition for their products. 

Regulation and Environmental 

NBP s operations are subject
to extensive regulation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) including its Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), its Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and its Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA), the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other federal, state, local and foreign authorities regarding
the processing, packaging, storage, safety, distribution, advertising and labeling of its products. 

NBP is subject to the Packers and Stockyards
Act of 1921 (PSA). Among other things, this statute generally requires NBP to make full payment for livestock purchases not later than
the close of business the day after the purchase and transfer of possession or determination of the purchase price. Under the PSA,
NBP must hold in trust for the benefit of unpaid cash livestock suppliers all receivables, inventory and proceeds derived from NBP's sale
of such cattle until the sellers have received full payment. In addition, pursuant to PSA rules, as of December 25, 2021, NBP has obtained
from an insurance company a surety bond in the amount of 50.4 million as a measure of protection for livestock sellers. 

The Dodge City and Liberal
facilities are subject to Title V permitting pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act and the Kansas Air Quality Act. The St. Joseph
and Tama facilities are subject to, and operating under, secondary permits. The Dodge City, Liberal, Tama, Hummels Wharf and
Moultrie facilities are subject to Clean Air Act Risk Management Plan requirements relating to the use of ammonia as a
refrigerant. 

All of NBP s plants, other than Liberal
and Tama, are indirect dischargers of wastewater to publicly owned treatment works and are subject to requirements under the federal Clean
Water Act, state and municipal laws, as well as agreements or permits with municipal or county authorities. NBP s plant in
Liberal operates a wastewater treatment plant and land applies the effluent from that plant under a permit issued by the Kansas Department
of Health and Environment. NBP s plant in Tama operates a wastewater treatment plant and is a direct discharger to the Iowa River
under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit issued by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. Upon renewal of these
agreements and permits, NBP is from time to time required to make capital expenditures to upgrade or expand wastewater treatment facilities
to address new and more stringent discharge requirements imposed at the time of renewal. Storm water discharges from NBP s plants
are also regulated by state and local authorities. 

All of NBP s facilities generate
solid waste streams including small quantities of hazardous wastes, and the St. Joseph facility is classified as a large-quantity generator
of hazardous waste. NBP is subject to laws that provide for strict, and in certain circumstances, joint and several liability for
remediation of hazardous substances at contaminated sites; however, NBP has not received any demands that it has any liability at sites
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund) or state counterparts. All plants are
subject to community right to know reporting requirements under the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, which requires
yearly filings as to the substances used on facility premises.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

As described throughout this document,
USPB s business involves the operation of an integrated cattle processing and beef marketing enterprise in which USPB s Class
A unitholders and associates supply cattle that are processed at the facilities owned and operated by NBP. NBP markets and distributes
the beef and beef products produced from both cattle supplied by USPB s unitholders and associates and other cattle purchased by
NBP from other sources. The financial results of NBP s operations therefore are the single largest influence on USPB s financial
performance. Consequently, those factors and risks that impact the performance of NBP s business have a direct and immediate influence
on USPB s performance. However, there are also some risks that are unique to USPB. This Risk Factors section is divided into
two parts, with one subsection focusing on the risk factors that influence the performance of NBP and another subsection discussing certain
risk factors that are directly applicable to USPB. 

USPB s business operations and
the implementation of our business strategy are subject to significant risks inherent in our business, including, without limitation,
the risks and uncertainties described below. The occurrence of any one or more of the risks or uncertainties described below could have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. While we believe we have identified and discussed
below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that
are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business, operations, industry, financial position, and financial
performance in the future. 

Risk Factors Associated With Operations of NBP 

The prices and availability of
key raw materials affects the profitability of its beef processing and manufacturing operations. 

The supply and market price of cattle
purchased by NBP are dependent upon a variety of factors over which NBP has no control, including fluctuations in the size of herds maintained
by producers, the relative cost of feed and energy, weather and livestock diseases. The cost of raw materials used by our manufacturing
businesses have fluctuated over time as a result of a variety of factors. Although our manufacturing businesses are not currently experiencing
any shortage of raw materials, if such shortages occur, revenues and profitability could decline. 

Outbreaks of disease affecting
livestock can adversely affect the supply of cattle and the demand for NBP s products. 

NBP is subject to risks relating to
animal health and disease control. An outbreak of disease affecting livestock (such as foot-and-mouth disease or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), commonly referred to as mad cow disease) could result in restrictions on sales of products, restrictions on
purchases of livestock from suppliers or widespread destruction of cattle. The discovery of BSE in the past caused certain
countries to restrict or prohibit the importation of beef products. Outbreaks of diseases, or the perception by the public that
an outbreak has occurred, or other concerns regarding diseases, can lead to inadequate supply, cancellation of orders by customers
and create adverse publicity, any of which can have a significant negative impact on consumer demand and, as a result, on our
consolidated financial position, cash flows and results of operations. 

If NBP s products or products made by others
using its products become contaminated or are alleged to be contaminated, NBP may be subject to product liability claims that could adversely
affect its business. 

NBP may be subject to significant
liability in excess of insurance policy limits if its products or products made by others using its products cause injury, illness
or death. In addition, NBP could recall or be required to recall products that are, or are alleged to be, contaminated, spoiled or
inappropriately labeled. Organisms producing food borne illnesses (such as E. coli could be present in NBP s products
and result in illness or death if they are not eliminated through further processing or cooking. Contamination of NBP s or its
competitors products may create adverse publicity or cause consumers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of beef
products. Allegations of product contamination may also be harmful even if they are untrue or result from third-party
tampering. Any of these events may increase costs or decrease demand for beef products, any of which could have a significant
adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. 

9 

NBP generally does not enter into long-term contracts
with customers; as a result the volumes and prices at which beef products are sold are subject to market forces. 

NBP s customers generally place
orders for products on an as-needed basis and, as a result, their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary
significantly in the future. The loss of one or more significant customers, a significant decline in the volume of orders from customers
or a significant decrease in beef product prices for a sustained period of time could negatively impact cash flows and results of operations. 

NBP s exports expose it to political and economic
risks in the U.S. and foreign countries, as well as to risks related to currency fluctuations. 

Approximately 12 of NBP s 2022
sales were export sales, primarily to Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, Italy and Canada, and on average these sales
have a higher margin than domestic sales of similar products. A reduction in international sales could adversely affect revenues and margins. Risks
associated with international activities include inflation or deflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including changes
in currency exchange rates of other countries that may export beef products in competition with NBP; the closing of borders by foreign
countries to product imports due to disease or other perceived health or food safety issues; exchange controls; changes in tariffs; changes
in political or economic conditions; trade restrictions and changes in regulatory requirements. The occurrence of any of these events
could increase costs, lower demand for products or limit operations, which could have a significant adverse effect on cash flows, results
of operations and future prospects. 

NBP incurs substantial costs to comply with environmental
regulations and could incur additional costs as a result of new regulations or compliance failures that result in civil or criminal penalties,
liability for damages and negative publicity. 

NBP s operations are subject to
extensive and stringent environmental regulations administered by the EPA and state, local and other authorities with regards to water
usage, wastewater and storm water discharge, air emissions and odor, and waste management and disposal. Failure to comply with these laws
and regulations could have serious consequences, including criminal, civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity. In addition,
NBP incurs and will continue to incur significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with existing and new or more stringent
regulations and requirements. Most of NBP s processing facilities procure wastewater treatment services from municipal or other
regional governmental agencies that are in turn subject to environmental laws and permit limits regarding their water discharges. The
remaining processing facilities operate wastewater treatment facilities that are subject to environmental laws and permit limits. As permit
limits are becoming more stringent, upgrades and capital improvements to these treatment facilities are likely. In locations where
NBP is a significant volume discharger, it could be asked to contribute toward the costs of such upgrades or to pay significantly increased
water or sewer charges to recoup such upgrade costs. NBP may also be required to undertake upgrades and make capital improvements
to its own wastewater pretreatment facilities, the cost of which could be significant. Compliance with environmental regulations
has had and will continue to have a significant impact on NBP s cash flows and profitability. In addition, under most environmental
laws, most notably the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and analogous state laws, NBP could
be held liable for the cost to investigate or remediate any contamination at properties it owns or operates, or as to which it arranges
for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances, as such liability is imposed without regard to fault. 

NBP is subject to extensive governmental regulation
and noncompliance with or changes in applicable requirements could adversely affect its business, financial condition, cash flows and
results of operations. 

In addition to the environmental laws
and regulations noted above, NBP is subject to extensive and evolving regulation and oversight, including regulation by the USDA (and
its FSIS, APHIS and GIPSA agencies), the FDA, the DOL, the EEOC, the DHS and other federal, state, local and foreign authorities. This
regulation and oversight pertains to all aspects of NBP s operations, including (i) the procurement of cattle, (ii) the processing,
packaging, storage, safety, distribution and sale, advertising and labeling of its products, and (iii) the recruitment, employment, retention
and safety of its employees. Accordingly, the failure or alleged failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations could expose
NBP to legal claims and enforcement actions and could result in administrative penalties and injunctive relief, civil remedies, fines,
interruption of operations, recalls of products or seizures of properties, potential criminal sanctions and personal injury or other damage
claims. These remedies, changes in the applicable laws and regulations or discovery of currently unknown conditions could increase
costs, limit business operations and reduce profitability. 

10 

NBP s performance depends on an adequate labor
supply and favorable labor relations with its employees, in particular employees represented by collective bargaining agreements. 

A substantial number of NBP s
employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In addition, many industries in the United States have recently
experienced a shortage of trained labor, often for reasons beyond their control. A failure to procure and retain an adequate labor
supply or a labor-related work stoppage by unionized employees, or employees who become unionized in the future, could limit
NBP s ability to process and ship products or could increase costs. Any significant decrease in adequately trained labor, any
significant increase in labor costs, deterioration of employee relations, slowdowns or work stoppages at any of NBP s
locations, whether due to union activities, employee turnover, pandemic or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. 

NBP faces industry-wide legal actions in connection
with its business activities, and current or future legal actions may result in material liabilities and losses. 

NBP has been named, and from time to time
may be named, in various industry-wide legal actions, including arbitrations, class or representative actions, actions or inquiries by
state attorneys general and other regulators, and other litigation arising in connection with its business activities. Adverse outcomes
related to legal actions could result in substantial damages and could cause NBP s earnings to decline. 

NBP is a defendant in five class action
lawsuits in the United States District Court, Minnesota District alleging that it violated the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Packers
and Stockyards Act, the Commodity Exchange Act, and various state laws and two class action lawsuits in Canada alleging violations
of Canadian Competition Act and various provincial laws. (the Beef Antitrust Cases ). Since
the original filings, certain putative class members in one of the Beef Antitrust Cases have opted out of the matter and are
proceeding with individual direct actions making similar claims, and others may do so in the future. NBP is also a defendant
in a class action lawsuit alleging that it directly and through a wage survey and benchmarking
service exchanged information regarding labor rates in an effort to depress and fix the rates of wages for workers in violation of
federal antitrust laws (the Wage Rate Antitrust Case . NBP believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims
in the Beef Antitrust Cases and the Wage Rate Antitrust Case and intends to defend these cases, and any other cases, vigorously.
There can be no assurances, however, as to the outcome of these matters or the impact on the NBP s consolidated financial
position, results of operations and cash flows. USPB has no way of predicting what, if any, impact the litigation will have on the
earnings distributed by NBP to USPB. 

Risk Factors Associated with USPB 

USPB facilitates the delivery of the cattle provided
by its Class A unitholders and associates to NBP and does not have arrangements for alternative markets for its Class A unitholders and
associates cattle. 

NBP is the only beef processor that USPB
has a cattle delivery agreement with. USPB has not developed alternative customers for the cattle delivered by USPB s Class A unitholders
and associates. If events were to occur which would prevent NBP from purchasing and processing the cattle supplied by USPB s Class
A unitholders and associates, USPB would need to exercise provisions in its agreements with both NBP and USPB s Class A unitholders
that would permit USPB to reduce the number of cattle acquired from Class A unitholders and sold to NBP. While such provisions would mitigate
harm to USPB, it is likely that the value of the Class A and Class B units and the associated delivery rights held by USPB s Class
A unitholders would be impaired. 

USPB s investment in NBP could become impaired. 

USPB s investment in NBP is carried
under the equity method of accounting. Although NBP s results from operations are currently highly profitable, pandemic events
such as COVID-19, industry trends, and other economic factors could have a negative impact on NBP s operations and cash flows. As
a result, the fair market value of USPB s investment in NBP could decrease to a level that is less than the carrying value.
If such situation is deemed to not be temporary, USPB would record an impairment charge, which may have an impact on the trading values
of USPB s Class A and Class B units. 

11 

Pandemics, such as COVID-19, may adversely affect NBP s
ability to keep the cattle slaughter at normal levels, the ability of USPB members to deliver cattle for processing based on their ownership
of Class A units may be impacted. 

Pandemics may cause NBP to temporarily
reduce fed cattle slaughter at several of its beef processing plants. If NBP is unable to maintain the slaughter at normal levels
for an extended period, USPB members may be delayed in delivering their cattle or may be required to deliver to a different NBP processing
plant. As the right and obligation to deliver cattle is associated with ownership of USPB s Class A units, such a result may impact
the value or liquidity of Class A units. 

The other members of NBP do not deliver cattle to NBP
for processing, creating the possibility that the interests of those other members of NBP could conflict with the interests of USPB and
its unitholders. 

The other members of NBP do not deliver
cattle to NBP for processing and marketing. As a result, conflicts of interest may arise between USPB and NBP relating to cattle purchases.
If a dispute were to arise, the settlement of any such dispute may not be on terms as favorable to USPB as would be expected if all of
the members of NBP were involved in the delivery of cattle to NBP for processing. 

The Internal Revenue Service could assert that USPB
should be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. 

Under applicable regulations, an unincorporated
entity such as a limited liability company is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes unless the entity is considered
a publicly traded partnership or the entity affirmatively elects to be taxed as a corporation. USPB has not elected to be
taxed as a corporation, and USPB believes that it should be treated as a partnership not taxable as a corporation for federal income tax
purposes. USPB has not requested and will not request any ruling from the IRS, however, with respect to its classification as a partnership
for federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were to assert successfully that USPB were taxable as a corporation for federal income tax
purposes in any taxable year, holders of Class A units and Class B units would not be required to report on their federal income tax returns
their allocable share of USPB s items of income, gain, deduction, and loss for that year and USPB would be subject to tax on its
net income for that year at corporate tax rates. In addition, any distributions would be taxable to holders of Class A units and Class
B units as dividend income. Taxation of USPB as a corporation could materially reduce the after-tax return on an investment in Class A
units and Class B units and could substantially reduce the value of the Class A units and Class B units. 

Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal
controls could have a material adverse effect on USPB s business, operating results and financial condition. 

USPB documents and tests its internal
control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires annual management assessments of the
effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting. This process is both costly and challenging. If USPB fails to achieve
and maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, it may
not be able to ensure that it can conclude on an ongoing basis that it has effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance
with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for USPB to produce reliable financial reports and are
important to helping prevent financial fraud. If USPB cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, its business and operating
results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in its reported financial information, and its business, results of operation
and financial condition could be adversely affected. 

USPB depends on the service of key senior management
personnel, the loss of which could materially harm its business. 

USPB s success will depend, in part,
on the efforts of its key senior management personnel. The market for qualified personnel is competitive and USPB s future success
will depend on its ability to attract and retain these personnel. USPB does not have long-term employment agreements with most of its
senior management. USPB may not be able to negotiate either new contracts or renewals of any existing long-term employment agreements
on terms favorable to USPB or at all. The loss of the services of any of USPB s key senior management personnel or the failure to
attract and retain highly skilled personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on USPB s business, results of operations
and financial condition.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion should be
read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. 
In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this report contain forward-looking information that
involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking information
due to the factors discussed under Item 1A, Risk Factors , Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and elsewhere
in this report. 

Overview 

USPB was formed as a closed marketing
cooperative on July 1, 1996. Its mission is to increase the quality of beef and long-term profitability of cattle producers by creating
a fully integrated producer-owned beef processing system that is a global supplier of high quality, value-added beef products responsive
to consumer desires. USPB operates an integrated cattle processing and beef marketing enterprise where consumer and processor demands
and requirements are implemented through changes in genetics, feeding, and management. USPB s unitholders benefit from its supplier
alliance with NBP through (i) premiums received in excess of cash market prices for higher quality cattle, (ii) allocations of profits
and potential distributions, (iii) potential unit price appreciation, and (iv) information that permits unitholders to make informed production
decisions. 

Effective August 29, 2004, the cooperative
restructured into a limited liability company (LLC) under Delaware law (Conversion). The business of USPB, the cooperative, is being continued
in the LLC form of business organization. 

As USPB filed a registration statement
with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with its 2004 Conversion from the cooperative form of business organization
to an LLC structure, USPB is subject to the informational requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), although
USPB is not required to be registered under the Exchange Act. Accordingly, USPB files periodic reports and other information with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Such reports, proxy statements and other information may be obtained by visiting the Public
Reference Room of the SEC at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549 or by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC
maintains an Internet site (www.sec.gov) that contains reports and information statements and other information regarding USPB and other
issuers that file electronically. 

On December 30, 2011, USPB sold the
majority of its membership interests in NBP to Leucadia National Corporation. Following the sale, USPB owned 15.0729 of NBP s membership
interests. 

On November 29, 2019, Jefferies (formerly
 Leucadia National Corporation sold its remaining ownership interest in NBP to a combination of NBM US Holdings, Inc., a
Delaware corporation owned by Marfrig Global Foods S.A.; NBPCo Holdings, LLC; and TMK Holdings, LLC. USPB elected to not participate in
the acquisition and, as a result, USPB s ownership interest in National Beef remained at 15.0729 . 

USPB s investment in NBP is accounted
for using the equity method of accounting as the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not have financial
or operational control. NBP s financial statements and footnotes are attached to USPB s 10-K. 

15 

Products and Production 

USPB provides an integrated cattle
production, processing and marketing system for the benefit of its unitholders and associates. As the basis of that system, USPB s
Class A unitholders have a guaranteed right plus an obligation (on a one head per Class A unit per delivery year basis) to deliver cattle
to USPB, pursuant to the Uniform Cattle Delivery and Marketing Agreement (see Cattle Delivery Arrangements ). USPB facilitates the
delivery of cattle to NBP for processing and subsequent product distribution and marketing. Shortly after the cattle are processed, cattle
suppliers receive, at no extra charge, individual animal carcass data previously considered proprietary by many processors. This carcass
data assists producers in refining production methodologies, thereby improving the product quality and subsequently enhancing the return
to the producer. 

We believe the primary advantage of
USPB s ownership in NBP centers around USPB s ability to provide NBP with a consistent supply of quality beef from a known
source, allowing NBP to target higher margin value-added markets. Consumers have historically demonstrated their willingness and desire
to buy branded products that offer better value in other consumer product markets, with the Certified Angus Beef product
line being an example in the beef industry. 

NBP is one of the largest beef processing
companies in the U.S., accounting for approximately 14 of fed cattle slaughter in the U.S. NBP processes and markets fresh and
chilled boxed beef, ground beef, beef by-products, consumer-ready beef and pork, and wet blue leather for domestic and international markets.
Based in Kansas City, Missouri, NBP had approximately 10,200 employees on December 24, 2022 and generated total revenues of 11.9 billion
in 2022. 

The largest part of NBP s
revenue is generated from the sale of boxed beef and beef by-products. NBP also generates revenues from value-added production of
consumer-ready products. In addition, NBP operates one of the largest hide tanning facilities in the world, selling wet blue
leather to tanners that produce finished leather for the automotive, luxury goods, apparel and furniture industries. Other
revenue streams include sales of portioned beef and other products directly to consumers through internet, direct mail and direct
response television by its subsidiary, Kansas City Steak Company, LLC, and service revenues generated by National Carriers,
Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary that is one of the largest refrigerated and livestock carrier operations in the U.S. and transports
products for NBP and a variety of other customers. NBP s profitability typically fluctuates seasonally as well as cyclically,
based on the availability of fed cattle. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The following discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates and revises its estimates based on historical experience and other assumptions
we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Changes in our estimates could materially
affect our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period. We believe USPB s most critical accounting policy
is as follows: 

Accounting for Investment in NBP. 
On December 30, 2011, USPB sold the majority of its ownership interest in NBP to Leucadia. On that date, USPB s investment in NBP
was measured at fair value and has since been carried under the equity method of accounting. Operating losses, economic and industry events,
and a variety of other factors may result in a decrease in the value of the investment, which is other than temporary. Such potential
other than temporary decreases in value will cause the Company to record an impairment charge, which may have an impact on the trading
values of USPB s Class A and Class B units.

capital (the excess of current assets over current liabilities) of approximately 93.8 million, which included cash and cash equivalents
of 97.7 million. As of December 25, 2021, we had net working capital (the excess of current assets over current liabilities) of approximately

2021 were cash, cash flows from operating activities, which includes distributions received from NBP, and available borrowings under the
Credit Agreement and Master Loan Agreement with CoBank. Our principal uses of cash are distributions to our members and working capital.

value of which are approximately 0.3 million and 0.1 million, respectively. 

CoBank Debt 

USPB s Amended and Restated Revolving
Term Supplement s matured on June 30, 2020. On June 24, 2020, CoBank unilaterally extended the Term Expiration Date under USPB s
Amended and Restated Revolving Term Supplement from June 30, 2020 up to and including August 31, 2020. On July 13, 2020, USPB, and CoBank,

contained in that certain Master Loan Agreement, Revolving Term Loan Supplement to the Master Loan Agreement, Pledge Agreement, and Security

The New Loan Agreements provide for a
 1.0 million Revolving Term Commitment, carries a term of five years and matures on June 30, 2025. The Promissory Note defines Interest
as equal to the One-Month LIBOR Index Rate or if LIBOR quotes are no longer available, CoBank will replace the LIBOR Index Rate with a
replacement benchmark rate. The other terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement and the Revolving Term Loan Supplement continue the

a first-priority security interest in USPB s Membership Interests in, and Distributions from, National Beef Packing Company, LLC.

debt outstanding. We had a 1.0 million Revolving Term Commitment with CoBank, all of which was available. USPB was in compliance with

Operating Activities 

Net cash provided by operating activities
was 205.9 million in fiscal year 2022 as compared to 280.3 million in fiscal year 2021. The 74.4 million decrease was primarily due
to decreased distributions received from NBP that were classified as a distribution from Operating Activities. 

Net cash provided by operating activities
was 280.3 million in fiscal year 2021 as compared to 194.2 million in fiscal year 2020. The 86.1 million increase was primarily due
to increased distributions received from NBP that were classified as a distribution from Operating Activities. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities
was 0.1 million and 0.0 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Net cash used
in investing activities was 0.0 million and less than 0.1 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash used in financing activities
was 238.5 million in fiscal year 2022 as compared to 226.6 million in fiscal year 2021. The 11.9 million increase was due to an increase
in distributions to members in fiscal year 2022, compared to fiscal year 2021. 

Net cash used in financing activities
was 226.6 million in fiscal year 2021 as compared to 195.3 million in fiscal year 2020. The 31.3 million increase was due to an increase
in distributions to members in fiscal year 2021, as a result of an increase in earnings, compared to fiscal year 2020. 

USPB believes cash, cash flows from
operating activities, and available borrowings under the Credit Agreement will be sufficient to support its working capital and cash flow
requirements. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of December 31, 2022 and December
25, 2021, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. 

Inflation 

We believe our results of operations
are not materially affected by moderate changes in the inflation rate. Inflation and changing prices did not have a material effect on
our operations in fiscal years 2022 and 2021. Severe increases in inflation, however, could affect the global and U.S. economies and could
have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

20 

Seasonality and Fluctuations in Operating Results 

The Company s operating results
are influenced by seasonal factors in the beef industry. These factors affect the price NBP pays for livestock as well as the ultimate
price at which NBP sells its products. The seasonal demand for beef products is highest in the summer and spring months as weather patterns
permit more outdoor activities and there is an increased demand for higher value items that are grilled, such as steaks. Both live cattle
prices and boxed beef prices tend to be at seasonal highs during the summer and fall. Because of higher consumption, more favorable growing
conditions and the housing of animals in feedlots for the winter months, there are generally more cattle available in the summer and fall. 

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The principal market risk affecting USPB s
business is exposure to interest rate risk, to the extent the Company has debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not
have any outstanding debt. 

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

The financial statements and notes thereto,
and other information required by this Item 8, are included in this report beginning on page F-1. 

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

None. 

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

We maintain a system of controls and
procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the financial statements and other disclosures included in
this report, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition. We evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under supervision
and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation,
as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in alerting them, in a timely manner, to material information required to be
included in our periodic Securities and Exchange Commission filings. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the fifty-three weeks ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. The design of any system of controls and procedures is based in part upon certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events. 

Management s Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

Management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability
of the Company s financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and managers of the Company; and 

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use
or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. 

21 

Internal control over financial reporting,
no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management has assessed the effectiveness
of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the
criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated
Framework (2013 Framework) . 

Based on the Company s processes
and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company s internal control over
financial reporting was operating effectively. 

This annual report does not include a
report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not
subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit
us to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION 

The Company may purchase a portion
of its outstanding Class A and Class B units from time to time in accordance with the limits imposed under the CoBank Credit Agreement.

agreement, the number of directors is set by the Board of Directors but may not be less than seven directors. Directors must be unitholders
of USPB. Seven directors will always be elected by unitholders holding Class A units. 

The directors are elected at the annual
meeting of the unitholders and hold office for a term of three years. The terms of the directors are staggered in such a manner that approximately
one-third of the directors will be elected each year. All directors will hold office until their successors are elected and qualified.
Any vacancy in the board, other than a vacancy resulting from expiration of a term of office, will be filled by a majority vote of the
remaining directors. In case a vacancy in the Board of Directors extends beyond the next annual meeting, the vacancy will be filled by
the remaining directors until such meeting, at which meeting a director will be chosen by the unitholders for the unexpired term of such
vacancy. 

In the discretion of the Board of Directors,

ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Overview of Compensation Program 

This Compensation Discussion and Analysis
describes the material elements of compensation paid to our named executive officers as well as the objectives and material factors underlying
our compensation program. The compensation program places emphasis on USPB s financial performance and the benefits received by
USPB s unitholders. 

The Compensation Committee (Committee)
is responsible for developing and administering the compensation program for USPB s named executive officers and professional staff. 

Compensation Philosophy and Objectives 

USPB s compensation program is
a key element in attracting, retaining, and motivating named executive officers with the skills necessary to create value for the unitholders.
To achieve this goal, we have designed the compensation program with the following objectives: 

Attracting and retaining top talent The compensation of USPB s executive officers
must be commensurate with the competitive regional marketplace taking into consideration job responsibilities and supply of competent
employees with the education and background to perform at the highest levels in their field. 

Paying for financial and operational performance The compensation of USPB s executive
officers should motivate them to achieve strong financial and operational results. USPB must achieve specific levels of financial and
operational performance to allow executives to earn this portion of their compensation. 

Alignment with the equity interests of our unitholders Management phantom unit plans approved
in September 2010 and January 2013 aligns management s interest with the equity interests of USPB s unitholders. 

Each element of our compensation program
is designed to achieve one or more of these objectives. The structure of a particular executive s compensation may vary depending
on the scope and level of that executive s responsibilities. 

26 

Determining Executive Compensation 

The CEO makes recommendations to the
Committee regarding the salaries and bonus programs for the executive officers. The Committee reviews the recommendations, taking into
account each element of total compensation. Based on the foregoing, the Committee uses its judgment in making compensation decisions that
will best carry out USPB s philosophy and objectives for executive compensation. 

Fiscal Year 2022 Executive Compensation Elements 

The elements of our named executive
officers total compensation package are as follows: 

base salary; 

annual cash bonuses; 

long-term cash bonus; 

discretionary cash bonuses; 

retirement plans; and 

limited personal benefits. 

Elements of Our Compensation Program 

Base Salary 

Base salaries are intended to provide
a level of compensation sufficient to attract and retain an effective management team, when considered in combination with the other components
of our executive compensation program. The relative levels of base salary for named executive officers are designed to reflect each executive
officer s scope of responsibility and accountability with USPB. Except for the CEO s salary, base salaries are reviewed annually
to determine if they are consistent with the performance of the individual executive and equitable relative to USPB s other executive
officers and professional staff. Salary surveys summarizing the compensation packages for positions of equivalent responsibility in related
industries were used to establish the CEO s base salary. 

On December 22, 2021, USPB entered into
an amended employment agreement with Mr. Linville (2022 Employment Agreement), which became effective on December 26, 2021. The 2022 Employment
Agreement provides for Mr. Linville to serve as USPB s CEO for a term that started on December 26, 2021 and expires on December
26, 2026. The 2022 Employment Agreement provides for Mr. Linville to receive an annual base salary of 363,000. 

27 

Annual Cash Incentive/Bonuses 

Cash incentive and bonus plans were
designed to provide the financial incentive to the CEO and other named executive officers to influence USPB unitholder benefits and are
only paid after certain levels of benefits have been achieved. 

Under the terms of the 2022 Employment
Agreement, if Mr. Linville is employed by USPB on the last day of any fiscal year, he shall be paid an annual incentive compensation equal
to seventy-five one-hundredths of a percent (0.75 of the sum of the total financial benefits to USPB (USPB Total Benefits) that exceed
 25,000,000 (Annual Incentive). The USPB Total Benefits are: (1) audited fiscal year-end USPB earnings before tax; and (2) the fiscal
year USPB grid premiums, which is the net sum of all USPB unitholder and associate grid premiums and discounts calculated through all
USPB grids at all plants as outlined in the 2022 Employment Agreement. 

For fiscal year 2022, named executive
officers and certain professional staff who were employed on the last day of the fiscal year will be paid his or her proportionate share
of the Management Bonus Pool. The Management Bonus Pool is: (1) the audited fiscal year 2022 USPB earnings before tax plus USPB grid premiums
during the fiscal year, less (2) 50,000,000, multiplied by (3) management bonus factor. The bonus plan payments are vested over a two-year
period. The maximum Management Bonus Pool for a given bonus plan year is equal to 150 of the sum of the qualifying participants 
salaries in effect at the end of such year. 

Long-term Incentive 

Mr. Linville is eligible for a long-term
incentive compensation under the 2022 Employment Agreement. If he is employed by USPB on December 26, 2026, he is to be paid long-term
incentive compensation equal to fifty one-hundredths of a percent (0.50 of the amount by which the USPB Total Benefits from December
26, 2021 to December 26, 2026 exceed 75,000,000 (Long-Term Incentive). The 2022 Employment Agreement provides for a cumulative annual
cap of 544,500 for payments to Mr. Linville for Annual Incentive and Long-Term Incentive cash bonuses. 

Discretionary Cash Bonuses 

Discretionary bonuses may be paid to
named executive officers, other than the CEO, and professional staff to compensate for extraordinary cases of individual or Company performance. 

Retirement Plans 

Qualifying employees are encouraged
to participate in the Company s sponsored 401(k) savings plan. Under USPB s plan, employees may contribute up to the maximum
amount permissible by IRS limits. USPB matches 100 of each dollar contributed by a participant up to a maximum of 4 of his or her qualifying
compensation. 

Limited Personal Benefits 

USPB also provides certain benefits
to all salaried employees that are not included as perquisites in the Summary Compensation Table for the named executives because they
are broadly available. These include health and welfare benefits, and disability and life insurance. 

28 

Equity Compensation 

In September 2010, USPB s Board
of Directors approved a management phantom unit plan. The phantom unit plan provides for the award of unit appreciation rights to certain
management employees of USPB. USPB s CEO administers the phantom unit plan and awards Phantom Units (Class A and Class
B Units) to employees in amounts determined by the CEO, subject to the total Phantom Unit amount approved by the Board of Directors of
USPB. During fiscal year 2011, a total of 5,000 Class A phantom units and 5,000 Class B phantom units were awarded to management employees.
As a result of the retirement of one of USPB s employees on December 31, 2014, 4,750 Class A phantom units and 4,750 Class B phantom
units remained outstanding, all of which were fully vested. 

In November 2012, USPB s Board
of Directors approved the issuance of an additional 1,500 Class A phantom units and 1,500 Class B phantom units to certain members of
management, to be effective on January 28, 2013. These phantom units were fully vested and remained outstanding. 

Employment Agreements 

With the exception of the CEO, all
of our executive officers are employed at-will, without employment agreements, severance payment agreements or payment arrangements that
would be triggered by a change in control of USPB. 

CEO Employment Agreement 

On December 22, 2021, USPB entered into
the 2022 Employment Agreement with Mr. Linville, which became effective on December 26, 2021 and expires on December 26, 2026, subject
to earlier termination as provided in the agreement. The 2022 Employment Agreement provides for a 363,000 salary and annual and long-term
cash bonuses. The 2022 Employment Agreement provides for a cumulative average annual cap of 544,500 for payments to Mr. Linville for
annual and long-term cash bonuses. 

The 2022 Employment Agreement also provides
for post termination compensation. In addition to the amounts described below that will be payable upon termination of the agreement,
Mr. Linville has agreed to a noncompetition provision that, for twelve (12) months following the termination of Mr. Linville s employment
with USPB, prohibits him from participating in the management or control of any beef industry business or enterprise that competes with
the business of USPB and its various affiliates. During such period, Mr. Linville will receive a monthly payment equal to one twelfth
of Mr. Linville s annual salary at the time of termination. If Mr. Linville terminates the agreement for any or no reason, USPB
need only pay salary earned to the date of the termination, and the noncompetition compensation, unless termination is the result of death
or permanent disability. If USPB terminates the agreement for any reason other than cause, death or disability, or if Mr. Linville terminates
the 2022 Employment Agreement for good reason, Mr. Linville shall be entitled to salary and benefits through employment year 2026; payment
of certain fringe benefits through employment year 2026; the annual incentive bonus for the year in which the termination occurs and each
subsequent year through employment year 2026; the long-term incentive bonus that would have accrued had Mr. Linville been employed through
employment year 2026; and the payment of the noncompetition compensation. 

Impact of Tax and Accounting Treatments 

We believe the compensation paid to
our named executive officers is fully deductible under the Internal Revenue Code at the time it is paid. 

Unit Ownership Guidelines 

USPB does not allow its named executive
officers to own USPB s Class A units. As of December 31, 2022, certain members of management own a total of 6,250 Class A and 6,250
Class B phantom unit rights awarded under the management phantom unit plans also discussed above. 

Compensation Committee Report 

The Committee has reviewed and discussed
the foregoing Compensation Discussion and Analysis with USPB s management. Based on the Committee s review and discussions
with management, the Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors that this Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Discussion of Summary Compensation Table and Grants of
Plan-Based Awards 

Performance Based Annual Cash Bonuses 

Our executive officers earn bonus awards
made pursuant to various annual cash bonus plans. The awards utilize formulas set by the Compensation Committee. The bonuses earned pursuant
to the plans appear in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation in the Summary Compensation Table. Annual incentive bonuses awarded
to executives, excluding Mr. Linville, also appear in the Grants of Plan Based Awards table . The formulas
used to calculate the annual performance-based bonus awards to the Named Executive Officers were as follows: 

Name 
 
 Bonus Formula 
 
 Stanley D. Linville 
 
 For fiscal year 2023: 0.75 of the sum of the total financial benefits to USPB (USPB Total Benefits) that exceed 25,000,000. USPB Total Benefits are: (1) audited fiscal year-end USPB earnings before tax; and (2) the fiscal year USPB grid premiums, which is the net sum of all USPB unitholder and associate grid premiums and discounts calculated through all USPB grids at all plants as outlined in the Employment Agreement. 

Scott J. Miller and 
 Danielle D. Imel 
 
 For fiscal year 2023: The executive s proportionate share of the Management Bonus Pool, which is (1) the audited fiscal
 year 2023 USPB earnings before tax plus USPB grid premiums during fiscal year 2023, less (2) 50,000,000, multiplied by
 (3) management bonus factor. The bonus plan payments are vested over a two-year period. The maximum Management
 Bonus Pool for a given bonus plan year is equal to 150 of the sum of the qualifying participants salaries in effect at the
 end of such year.

Discretionary cash bonuses may also
be paid to executive officers from time to time to reward elements of performance that are not reflected in the criteria for performance
based cash bonuses. No such bonuses were paid to executive officers in fiscal year 2022, 2021, and 2020. The discretionary bonuses, if
paid, are disclosed in the Bonus column in the Summary Compensation Table.

Potential Payments Upon Termination 

Mr. Stanley D. Linville 

If the 2022 Employment Agreement is
terminated upon death or permanent disability, Mr. Linville is entitled to: 

Salary to the date of the termination plus continued monthly payment of salary through the earlier of
the first anniversary of the termination or the contract expiration date (Deemed Termination Date). If Mr. Linville were terminated upon
death or disability in fiscal year 2022, his payment would be 363,000; 
 
 If termination is due to permanent disability, provision of certain fringe benefits through the Deemed
Termination Date, but excluding vacation pay, personal and sick days, vehicle, telecommunications, and 401(k) contributions, (subject
to any necessary consent of applicable insurers which, if consent is not obtained within 30 days after termination, then the cash value
of the monthly premiums at the date of termination shall be paid to CEO in equal monthly payments), through the Deemed Termination Date; 
 
 Annual Incentive through the employment year in which the Deemed Termination Date occurs pro-rated for
the last employment year based upon the period through the Deemed Termination Date; 
 
 Long-term Incentive that would have accrued if Mr. Linville had remained employed under the 2022 Employment
Agreement through the Deemed Termination Date; and 
 
 The 2022 Employment Agreement provides for a cumulative annual cap of 544,500 for payments to Mr. Linville
for Annual Incentive and Long-Term Incentive amounts. 

33 

If the 2022 Employment Agreement is
terminated by USPB for cause or by Mr. Linville for other than good reason, he is entitled to: 

Salary earned to the date of the termination; and 
 
 Payment of noncompetition compensation, unless Mr. Linville is terminated for being convicted of a felony
or other serious crime or engaging in fraud, embezzlement or other illegal conduct to the detriment of USPB, in which case noncompetition
compensation will not be paid. 

If the 2022 Employment Agreement is
terminated by USPB other than for cause, death or disability, or by Mr. Linville for good reason, he shall be entitled to: 

Salary and benefits through December 26, 2026; 
 
 Payment of certain fringe benefits, but excluding vacation pay, personal and sick days, vehicle, telecommunications,
and 401(k) contributions (subject to any necessary consent of applicable insurers which, if consent is not obtained within 30 days after
termination, then the cash value of the monthly premiums at the date of termination shall be paid to CEO in equal monthly payments) through
December 26, 2026; 
 
 Annual Incentive for the year in which the termination occurs and each subsequent year through employment
year 2026; 
 
 Long-Term Incentive that would have accrued had Mr. Linville had remained employed through employment
year 2026; and 
 
 The payment of the noncompetition compensation. 
 
 The 2022 Employment Agreement provides for a cumulative annual cap of 544,500 for payments to Mr. Linville
for Annual Incentive and Long-Term Incentive amounts. 

Where the 2022 Employment Agreement provides
for post-termination noncompetition compensation, Mr. Linville will receive a monthly payment equal to the annual salary that would be
paid to Mr. Linville under the 2022 Employment Agreement or his annual salary at the time of termination, whichever is greater, divided
by twelve (12), which will be paid at normal salary payment intervals in effect for management personnel on the date of termination. USPB
will also pay Mr. Linville certain fringe benefits provided to other employees of USPB, but excluding paid vacations, personal and sick
days, allowances, telecommunications equipment or services, expense reimbursement (except on prior written approval), or 401(k) contributions
(subject to any necessary consent of applicable insurers which, if consent is not obtained within 30 days after termination, then the
cash value of the monthly premiums at the date of termination will be paid to CEO in equal monthly payments during the noncompetition
period). In return for such payment, Mr. Linville has agreed to a noncompetition provision that, for twelve (12) months following the
termination of Mr. Linville s employment with USPB, prohibits him, within the United States of America, from participating through
management or control or consult or employment of any beef packing or processing industry business or enterprise that competes with the
business of USPB and its various affiliates. USPB may terminate the USPB noncompetition payments prior to the end of the twelve (12) month
period if the Board of Directors determines the CEO violated the noncompetition restriction as outlined in the 2022 Employment Agreement.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 

Related Party Transactions 

USPB s Board of Directors has
not adopted a formal policy or procedure that must be followed prior to any transaction, arrangement or relationship with a related person,
as defined by SEC regulations (e.g., directors, executive officers, any 5 percent shareholder, or immediate family member of any of the
foregoing). 

USPB has adopted a corporate Code of
Conduct that is enforced throughout all levels of management. It deals with conflicts of interest, among other things. The Code prohibits
any conduct or activities that conflict with the interests of the Company, or that might influence or appear to influence our judgment
or actions in performing our duties. The Code also requires directors and all levels of management to make full written disclosure of
any activity that may present a conflict of interest and receive prior written approval from the Company. No waivers have been granted. 

Our directors and all levels of management
are required each year to respond to a questionnaire regarding their independence. The questionnaire also requires each director and all
levels of management to identify if they or an immediate family member had been indebted to, or had been a participant in any material
transactions with, the Company or any of its affiliates. The questionnaire requires disclosure of the name of related parties if such
parties have an ownership or management control relationship with the Company sufficient to exert significant influence over the Company s
management or operating policies which could cause significantly different operating results or financial position of the Company. 

The standards applied pursuant to the
above-described procedures are to provide comfort that any conflict of interest or related party transaction is on an arms-length basis
which is fair to the Company. 

Directors who are Unitholders 

USPB is not a listed company and as
a result has chosen the NASDAQ independence listing standards to determine whether our directors are independent. The NASDAQ independence
definitions provide that directors cannot be independent if they do not meet certain objective standards. 

All of USPB s directors hold
units of the LLC and are also agricultural producers. By virtue of their unitholder status and ownership of Class A units, each of these
individuals is obligated to deliver cattle to USPB. The amount and terms of the payments received by these individuals (or the entities
they represent) for the delivery of cattle are made on exactly the same basis as those received by other unitholders and associates of
USPB for the delivery of their cattle. Based on the NASDAQ s standards and as a result of their equal treatment with respect to
the delivery of cattle, the following current directors were determined to be independent: Messrs. Bohn, Carpenter, Freund, Gardiner,
McCloy, Morgan, and Sternberger. 

Certain Arrangements with Holders of NBP s Membership
Interests 

All of the holders of NBP s membership
interests have entered into a limited liability company agreement that provides for, among other things, election of its board of managers,
the powers of its board of managers and its officers, approval rights for certain of its equity holders, restrictions and rights related
to the transfer, sale or purchase of its membership interests, and preemptive and repurchase rights. 

38 

Transactions with NBP 

On June 10, 2019, USPB entered into
the First Amended and Restated Cattle Purchase and Sale Agreement with NBP (Amended Agreement). Per the terms and conditions of
the Amended Agreement, NBP is required to purchase from USPB Class A unitholders, and USPB is required to cause to be sold and delivered
from its Class A unitholders to NBP, a base amount of 735,385 (subject to adjustment) head of cattle per year. In fiscal years 2022, 2021,
and 2020, USPB elected to increase the number of cattle that its Class A unitholders could deliver during USPB s delivery year by
up to 10 . During fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, USPB s Class A unitholders and associates provided approximately 23 of NBP s
total cattle requirements, under the Amended Agreement. The purchase price for the cattle is determined by pricing grids, which, at all
times, are required to be no less favorable than any other pricing grid being utilized by NBP and the pricing grid shall be competitive
with NBP s major competitors for the purchase of cattle. The terms and conditions of the Amended Agreement are substantially the
same as the previous agreement except in the following material ways: 

Under the Amended Agreement, if NBP acquires or develops new processing (slaughter) facilities, then
USPB has a first right to provide 25 of the cattle to the new NBP facility. 
 
 The purchase price of cattle delivered by USPB Class A unitholders to the Tama, Iowa processing facility
shall be no less favorable than any other pricing grid that NBP offers to any other seller of cattle delivering to the Tama, Iowa processing
facility or to non-grid cattle with comparable performance. 
 
 On each anniversary of the Amended Agreement, the term of the Amended Agreement shall be extended be
five years from the date of such anniversary, unless either party elects to not extend the term. The Amended Agreement currently extends
through June 10, 2026. 

NBP also purchased additional cattle
from certain USPB members and associates outside of the Amended Agreement.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

Board of Directors and Members 

 U.S. Premium Beef, LLC 

Opinion on the financial statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of U.S. Premium Beef,
LLC (a Delaware limited liability company) (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, the related statements
of operations, members capital and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related
notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to
be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit
of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical audit matters 

Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period
audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex
judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters. 

/s/ 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2018.

 Notes to Financial Statements 

of NBP s membership interests. 

On November 29, 2019, Jefferies Financial
Group, Inc. Jefferies , formerly Leucadia National Corporation) sold its remaining ownership interest in NBP to a combination
of NBM US Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation owned by Marfrig Global Foods S.A.; NBPCo Holdings, LLC; and TMK Holdings, LLC. USPB
elected to not participate in the acquisition and, as a result, USPB s ownership interest in National Beef remained at 15.0729 . 

Ownership Structure 

As USPB is structured as a Limited Liability
Company, its members are not personally liable for liabilities of USPB. USPB s members are taxed on their proportionate share of
USPB s taxable income. 

Class A Units . There are 
Class A units outstanding. Class A unitholders are allocated 10 of the Company s profits and losses. Holders of USPB Class A units,
committed under Uniform Cattle Delivery and Marketing Agreements, have the right and obligation to deliver one head of cattle to USPB
annually for each unit held. 

Class B Units. There are 
Class B units outstanding. Class B unitholders are allocated 90 of the Company s profits and losses. Holders of USPB Class B units
have no cattle delivery commitment. 

million and million, respectively. The cash is invested
in CoBank s overnight investment account. Investments are not deposits and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
or the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation. 

investment in NBP is accounted for using the equity method of accounting as the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence,
but does not have financial or operational control. 

The table below summarizes
the changes to USPB s investment in NBP. 

Equity in net income 

Distributions 

Ending Investment Balance 

The difference between
USPB s percentage ownership share of NBP earnings and the recorded amount of Equity in income of National Beef Packing Company,
LLC is attributable to the amortization of a basis difference related to the purchase accounting for NBP s acquisition of Ohio Beef
in 2019. 

For fiscal years 2022 and 2021, USPB conducted
an evaluation to determine if its investment in NBP was impaired as of the end of the fiscal year in accordance with Auditing Standards
Codification (ASC) 323 Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures . The evaluation included both quantitative and qualitative
factors. The quantitative approach computed the fair value of the investment using a market based approach and resulted in a fair value
that exceeded the carrying value. There were no qualitative items that indicated that the quantitative determination was not correct.
As a result of the analysis, USPB concluded that the carrying value of its investment in NBP was not impaired as of December 31, 2022
and December 25, 2021. 

Beginning on January 1, 2023, and annually
thereafter, NBP s minority members, including USPB, are eligible to deliver a put notice to NBM US Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation
owned by Marfrig Global Foods S.A. (NBM). The put period begins on January 1 and ends on January 31 of each year. During the
put period, a NBP minority member can put to NBM a maximum of one third of the aggregate units owned by such minority member as of February
28, 2019 and a minimum of 20 of the aggregate units owned by the applicable minority member as of February 28, 2019. USPB s
Board of Directors gave consideration to USPB s put option in December 2022 and chose to not exercise the put option for the January
2023 put period. 

On November 29, 2019, Jefferies sold its
remaining ownership interest in NBP to a combination of NBM US Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation owned by Marfrig Global Foods S.A.;
NBPCo Holdings, LLC; and TMK Holdings, LLC. USPB elected to not participate in the acquisition and, as a result, USPB s ownership
interest in National Beef remained at 15.0729 . In conjunction with the sale, NBP s members, including USPB, received proportionate
special distributions and tax distributions from NBP.

Leases 

USPB s two office leases are
accounted for under ASC 842. The Kansas City, MO office lease has a remaining term of approximately years. The Dodge City, KS office
renewed its office lease in 2020 and has a remaining term of approximately years. Neither lease agreement provides for renewals beyond
the remaining terms. The monthly lease payment for the Kansas City office is , subject to annual Consumer Price Index adjustments,
which are capped at 3 per year. The monthly lease payment for the Dodge City office is , which is not subject to adjustment. Both
offices are used for general office use only. As of December 31, 2022, the present value of the remaining operating lease payments for
the offices equaled million and USPB s balance sheet reflected Right of Use Assets and Lease Obligations equal to that amount.
The discount rate used to compute the present value was USPB s incremental borrowing rate adjusted for lease term. 

Class A phantom units and Class B phantom units were awarded to management employees, with a
strike price of and , respectively. The closing of the Leucadia Transaction resulted in management employees receiving a payment
under the management phantom unit plan. The payment to management was reduced by the strike price for both the Class A phantom units and
Class B phantom units and is now . As a result of the retirement of one of USPB s employees on December 31, 2014, Class A phantom
units and Class B phantom units were forfeited as they were not vested. One third of the retiring employee s vested phantom units
were exercised and the appreciation rights paid in three tranches (retirement, and first and second anniversary of retirement). At the
end of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, Class A phantom units and Class B phantom units remain outstanding. The phantom units became
fully vested in August 2015. For the management phantom unit plan, compensation expense of million, million, and million

by the Company, based on specific terms contained in the 401(k) Plan. The trustee of the 401(k) Plan, at the direction of each participant,
invests the assets of the 401(k) Plan in designated investment options. The 401(k) Plan is intended to qualify under Section 401 of the

total cattle requirements, under the Amended Agreement. The purchase price for the cattle is determined by pricing grids, which, at all
times, are required to be no less favorable than any other pricing grid being utilized by NBP and the pricing grid shall be competitive
with NBP s major competitors for the purchase of cattle. The terms and conditions of the Amended Agreement are substantially the
same as the previous agreement except in the following material ways:

USPB has a first right to provide 25 of the cattle to the new NBP facility. 
 
 The purchase price of cattle delivered by USPB Class A unitholders to the Tama, Iowa processing facility
shall be no less favorable than any other pricing grid that NBP offers to any other seller of cattle delivering to the Tama, Iowa processing
facility or to non-grid cattle with comparable performance. 
 
 On each anniversary of the Amended Agreement, the term of the Amended Agreement shall be extended for
five years from the date of such anniversary, unless either party elects to not extend the term. The Amended Agreement currently extends
through June 10, 2026. 

NBP also purchased additional cattle from certain

et al. which was filed originally on December 19, 2022 in the United States District Court, Southern District of Florida. On October
4, 2022, the United States Beef Class Actions and Opt-Out Cases were consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the United States District
Court, Minnesota District under the style In re: Cattle and Beef Antitrust Litigation . The plaintiffs in these cases seek treble
damages and other relief under various laws including the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Canadian Competition Act, the Packers Stockyards
Act, and/or the Commodities Exchange Act and various state and provincial laws and attorneys fees. NBP believes it has meritorious
defenses to the claims in these cases and intends to defend them vigorously. There can be no assurances, however, as to the outcome of
these matters or the impact on NBP s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

In addition to the antitrust litigation, NBP
is subject to an investigation by the United States Department of Justice DOJ and approximately 30 state attorneys general
regarding fed cattle and beef packing markets. NBP is cooperating with these investigations and is working with the DOJ and the
relevant states to provide information requested in connection with the investigations. NBP believes it has meritorious defenses to any
potential claims that might arise out of these government investigations, although there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these
investigations or the impact on NBP s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

NBP and one of its subsidiaries are defendants
in a putative class action lawsuit entitled Brown, et al. v. JBS USA Food Company et al. and filed in the United States District
Court, Colorado District on November 16, 2022, alleging that (i) the defendants directly and through a wage survey and benchmarking service
exchanged information regarding labor rates in an effort to depress and fix the rates of wages in violation of federal antitrust laws
and (ii) one of NBP s subsidiaries entered into an employee non-poach agreement with a competitor in violation of federal antitrust
laws. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, treble monetary damages, punitive damages, restitution, and pre- and post-judgment interest,
as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. NBP believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims in this case and intends to defend
the case vigorously. There can be no assurances, however, as to the outcome of this case or the impact on the NBP s consolidated
financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

On September 19, 2022, NBP received a grand jury
subpoena from the DOJ seeking documents and information regarding the solicitation, recruitment and hiring of employees in the meatpacking

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS 

Board of Managers 

 National Beef Packing Company, LLC 

We have audited the consolidated financial statements
of National Beef Packing Company, LLC (a Delaware limited liability company) and subsidiaries, (the Company ), which comprise
the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive income, cash flows, and members capital for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 31, 2022,
and the related notes to the financial statements. 

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and December
25, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 31, 2022
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for opinion 

We conducted our audits of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAS). Our responsibilities under
those standards are further described in the Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our
report. We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the relevant
ethical requirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide
a basis for our audit opinion. 

Responsibilities of management for the financial
statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation
and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation
of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

In preparing the consolidated financial statements,
management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date the financial statements are issued. 

Auditor s responsibilities for the audit
of the financial statements 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and
to issue an auditor s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance
and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with US GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it
exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered
material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable
user based on the consolidated financial statements. In performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS, we: 

Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 
 
 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
 
 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. 
 
 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting
estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 

We are required to communicate with those charged
with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal
control related matters that we identified during the audit.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

National Beef Packing Company,
LLC (the Company) is a Delaware limited liability company. The Company and its subsidiaries produce and sell meat products to customers
in the retail, distribution, food service, international, and further processor channels. The Company also produces and sells by-products,
that are derived from its meat processing operations, to customers in various industries. 

The Company operates beef slaughter
and fabrication facilities in Liberal and Dodge City, Kansas and Tama, Iowa, consumer-ready beef and pork processing facilities in Hummels
Wharf, Pennsylvania, Moultrie, Georgia and Kansas City, Kansas and a beef patty manufacturing facility in North Baltimore, Ohio. National
Carriers, Inc., or National Carriers, a wholly-owned subsidiary located in Dallas, Texas, provides trucking services to the Company
and to third parties and National Elite Transportation, LLC, or National Elite, a wholly-owned subsidiary located in Springdale, Arkansas,
provides third-party logistics services to the transportation industry. National Beef Leathers, LLC, or NBL, a wholly-owned subsidiary
located in St. Joseph, Missouri, provides hide tanning services for the Company. Kansas City Steak Company, LLC, or Kansas City Steak,
includes a direct to consumer business and operates a warehouse and fulfilment facility in Kansas City, Kansas. As of December 31,
2022, and December 25, 2021, approximately 57 of our employees were represented by collective bargaining agreements. The Company
makes certain contributions for the benefit of employees (see Note 6). 

NOTE 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTING
POLICIES 

Basis of Presentation
and Consolidation 

The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. All amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented
in U.S. dollars. 

Recent Accounting Standards 

In March 2020, the FASB issued
ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) : Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial
Reporting , which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging
relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. These amendments apply only
to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR or
another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The amendments are effective prospectively for all
entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company s credit facility bears a variable interest rate that can be
indexed off LIBOR rates, for which publication is expected to be discontinued in 2023. The Company s credit facility includes a
provision to provide an alternative benchmark rate in place of LIBOR rates once it is discontinued. The Company has not yet adopted this
guidance and is currently evaluating the potential impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements
and related disclosures.

NATIONAL BEEF PACKING COMPANY, LLC 

 AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Fiscal Year 

The Company s fiscal
year consists of 52 or 53 weeks, ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal 2022 was a 53-week fiscal year. Fiscal 2021 and 2020
were each 52-week fiscal years. All references to years in these notes to consolidated financial statements represent fiscal years unless
otherwise noted. 

Use of Estimates 

The consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, using management s
best estimates and judgments where appropriate. These estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of the contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The estimates and judgments will also affect
the reported amounts for certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from
these estimates and judgments. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The Company considers all highly
liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company s cash deposits are held
at multiple financial institutions. At times, deposits held with financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and does not believe it is exposed
to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents. 

Allowance for Returns
and Expected Credit Losses 

The allowance for returns and
expected credit losses is the Company s best estimate of the amount of probable returns and credit losses in the Company s
existing accounts receivable. The Company closely monitors accounts receivable balances and estimates the allowance for expected
credit losses. The estimates are based primarily on historical collection experience, customer conditions and other factors. Management
considers factors such as changes in the economy and industry. Specific accounts are reviewed individually for collectability. Historically,
the expected credit losses associated with accounts receivable have not been material. The majority of the provision and charge offs noted
below were done in relation to product and pricing claims, not credit losses. 

The following table represents
the rollforward of the allowance for returns and expected credit losses for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021
and December 26, 2020 (in thousands):

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Inventories 

Inventories consist primarily
of beef, beef by-products, parts and supplies and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost principally determined
under the first-in-first-out method for beef products and average cost for supplies. 

Inventories at December 31,
2022 and December 25, 2021 consisted of the following (in thousands): 

December 31, 2022 
 December 25, 2021 
 
 Dressed and boxed beef products 
 319,221 
 319,091

 Parts, supplies and other 
 56,455 
 46,619 
 
 Total inventory 
 420,149 
 416,163 

Property, plant and equipment 

Property, plant and equipment
are recorded at cost. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
life of the individual asset by major asset class as follows: 

Buildings and improvements 
 15 to 25 years 
 
 Machinery and equipment 
 2 to 15 years 
 
 Automotive equipment 
 2 to 4 years 
 
 Furniture and fixtures 
 3 to 5 years 

Depreciation expense was 75.3
million, 66.4 million and 59.2 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively. 

Upon disposition of these
assets, any resulting gain or loss is included in selling, general, and administrative. Major repairs and maintenance costs that
extend the useful life of the related assets are capitalized. Normal repairs and maintenance costs are charged to operations as
incurred. 

The Company capitalizes the
cost of interest on borrowed funds which are used to finance the construction of certain property, plant and equipment. Such capitalized
interest costs are charged to the property, plant and equipment accounts and are amortized through depreciation charges over the estimated
useful lives of the assets. Interest capitalized was 4.2 million, 1.7 million and 1.9 million for the fiscal years ended December 31,
2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively. 

The Company reviews its long-lived
assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. 
Recoverability of assets held and used is assessed based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows. Impairment, if any, is recognized
based on fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell and
are no longer depreciated. There were no events or circumstances which would indicate that the carrying amount of our property plant,
and equipment may not be recoverable during 2022, 2021 or 2020.

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets 

Accounting Standards Codification
(ASC) 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, provides that goodwill shall not be amortized but shall be tested for impairment
on an annual basis. Identifiable intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The Company
evaluates goodwill annually for impairment at the end of December and this test involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit
to the reporting unit s book value to determine if any impairment exists. Fair values are based on valuation techniques we
believe market participants would use, although the valuation process requires significant judgment and often involves the use of significant
estimates and assumptions. The Company calculates the fair value of the reporting unit using estimates of future cash flows and other
market comparable information deemed appropriate. The estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value could have a significant
effect on whether or not an impairment charge is recorded and the magnitude of such a charge. If the book value of a reporting unit
exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill
allocated to that reporting unit. As a result of the testing performed on the Company s goodwill, the fair value exceeded the carrying
value of the reporting unit and thus no impairment charge was recorded in the periods presented. Adverse market or economic events could
result in impairment charges in future periods. 

ASC 360, Impairment and
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , provides that we evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate, in management s judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. When testing for impairment,
we group our long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent
of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (or asset group). The determination of whether an asset group is recoverable is based
on management s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly attributable to the asset group as compared to its carrying
value. If the carrying amount of the asset group is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss would be recognized for
the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. As a result of the review performed, no triggering
events occurred during 2022, 2021 or 2020 related to the Company s long-lived assets, thus no impairment charge was recorded.

Overdraft Balances 

The majority of the Company s
bank accounts are zero balance accounts where cash needs are funded as checks are presented for payment by the holder. Checks issued pending
clearance that result in overdraft balances for accounting purposes are included in the trade accounts payable and cattle purchases payable
balances, and the change in the related balances are reflected in operating activities on the Company s consolidated statement of
cash flows. 

Self-insurance 

The Company is self-insured
for certain losses relating to workers compensation, automobile liability, general liability and employee medical and dental benefits. 
The Company has purchased stop-loss coverage in order to limit its exposure to any significant levels of claims. Self-insured losses are
accrued in accrued insurance and other long-term liabilities in the Company s consolidated balance sheets based upon the Company s
estimates of the aggregate uninsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions accepted in the insurance industry and the Company s
historical experience rates.

Distribution Payable 

Distribution payables represent
cash distributions to our members that have been declared but not paid as of the end of the period. The distribution was a current liability
at December 25, 2021, and paid in fiscal 2022. 

Environmental Expenditures
and Remediation Liabilities 

Environmental expenditures
that relate to current or future operations and which improve operational capabilities are capitalized at the time of expenditure. Expenditures
that relate to an existing or prior condition caused by past operations, and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation,
are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably
estimated. 

Foreign Currency Translation 

The Company has representative
offices located in Tokyo, Japan; Seoul, South Korea; and Hong Kong. The primary activity of these offices is to assist customers with
product and order related issues. For these foreign offices, the local currency is the functional currency. Translation into U.S. dollars
is performed for assets and liabilities at the exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are recorded at
average exchange rates for the period. Adjustments resulting from the translation are reflected as a separate component of other
comprehensive income. 

Income Taxes 

The provision for income taxes
is computed on a separate legal entity basis. Accordingly, as the Company is a limited liability company, the separate legal entity
does not provide for income taxes, as the results of operations are included in the taxable income of the individual members. However,
certain states impose privilege taxes on the apportioned taxable income or income related measurements of the Company. To the extent
that entities provide for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial
statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at each balance sheet date using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect in the
year the differences are expected to reverse and are thus included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Based
on federal income tax statute of limitations, National Carriers remains subject to examination of its income taxes for fiscal years 2022,
2021, 2020 and 2019. 

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments 

The carrying amounts of the
Company s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term trade and other receivables and payables, approximate
their fair values due to the short-term nature of the instruments. The carrying value of debt approximates its fair value at December
31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, as substantially all debt carries variable interest rates.

Selling, General and Administrative
Costs 

Selling expenses consist primarily
of salaries, trade promotions, advertising, commissions and other marketing costs. General and administrative costs consist primarily
of general management, insurance and professional expenses. Selling, general and administrative costs consist of aggregated expenses
that generally apply to multiple locations. 

Shipping Costs 

Pass-through finished goods
delivery costs reimbursed by customers are reported in sales, while an offsetting expense is included in cost of sales. 

Advertising 

Advertising expenses are charged
to operations in the period incurred and were 25.7 million, 25.3 million and 23.6 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022,
December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020. 

Comprehensive Income 

Comprehensive income consists
of net income and foreign currency translation adjustments. 

Derivative Activities 

The Company uses futures contracts
in order to reduce exposure associated with entering into firm commitments to purchase live cattle at prices determined prior to the delivery
of the cattle as well as firm commitments to sell certain beef products at sales prices determined prior to shipment. In accordance with
ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , the Company accounts for futures contracts and their related firm purchase commitments at fair
value. Firm commitments for sales are treated as normal sales and therefore not marked to market. Certain firm commitments to purchase
cattle, are marked to market when a price has been agreed upon, otherwise they are treated as normal purchases and, therefore, not marked
to market. ASC 815 imposes extensive recordkeeping requirements in order to treat a derivative financial instrument as a hedge for
accounting purposes. Derivatives qualify for treatment as hedges when there is a high correlation between the change in fair value of
the instrument and the related change in fair value of the underlying commitment. For derivatives that qualify as effective hedges, the
change in fair value has no net effect on earnings until the hedged transaction is settled. For derivatives that are not designated as
hedging instruments, or for the ineffective portion of a hedging instrument, the change in fair value does affect current period net earnings. 

While management believes each
of these instruments help mitigate various market risks, they are not designated and accounted for as hedges under ASC 815 as a result
of the extensive recordkeeping requirements of this statement. Accordingly, the gains and losses associated with the change in fair value
of the instrument and the offsetting gains and losses associated with 

 changes in the market value of certain of the
firm purchase commitments related to the futures contracts are recorded to income and expense in the period of change. 

The fair value of derivative
assets is recognized within Other current assets, while the fair value of derivative liabilities is recognized within Other accrued expenses
and liabilities.

NOTE 3. REVENUE RECOGNITION 

The Company generates revenue
primarily from customers in the retail, foodservice, international, and other channels. Our revenues primarily result from contracts with
customers which are generally short term in nature with the delivery of product as the single performance obligation. We recognize revenue
from the sale of the product at the point in time when our performance obligation has been satisfied and control of the product has transferred
to our customer, which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery to a customer based on terms of the sale. In accordance with ASC 340
 Other Assets and Deferred Costs , an entity may elect a practical expedient that allows the entity to recognize the incremental
costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the entity otherwise would have
recognized is one year or less. Our contracts are generally less than one year, therefore we have elected this practical expedient and
have recognized costs paid to obtain contracts as expense when incurred. Additionally, items that are not material in the context of the
contract are recognized as expense. Any taxes collected on behalf of government authorities are excluded from net revenues. 

Revenue is measured by the
transaction price, which is defined as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for providing goods to customers.
The transaction price is adjusted for estimates of known or expected variable consideration, which includes consumer incentives, trade
promotions, product returns, and allowances, such as discounts, rebates, volume-based incentives, cooperative advertising, and other programs.
Variable consideration related to these programs is recorded as a reduction to revenue based on amounts we expect to pay. We base these
estimates on current performance, historical utilization, and projected redemption rates of each program. We review and update these estimates
regularly until the incentives or product returns are realized and the impact of any adjustments are recognized in the period the adjustments
are identified. In many cases, key sales terms such as pricing and quantities ordered are established on a regular basis such that most
customer arrangements and related incentives have a duration of less than one year. Amounts billed and due from customers are short term
in nature and are classified as receivables since payments are unconditional and only the passage of time is required before payments
are due. Additionally, we do not grant payment financing terms greater than one year.

Contract Balances 

Nearly all of the Company s
contracts with its customers are short-term, defined as less than one year. The Company receives payment from customers based on terms
established with the customer. Payments are typically due within seven days of delivery. There are rarely contract assets related to costs
incurred to perform in advance of scheduled billings. The Company requires certain customers to pay in advance to avoid collection risk.
Revenue contract liabilities relate to payments received in advance of satisfying the performance under the customer contract and are
included in Other accrued expenses and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

NOTE 4. LEASES 

The Company reviews all agreements
entered into in order to determine if the contract contains a lease which will be accounted under ASC 842 Leases . Our portfolio
of leases primarily consists of machinery, equipment and railcars for our slaughter and fabrication facilities and tractors and trailers
for our wholly owned trucking subsidiary, National Carriers. In addition, we lease our corporate headquarters facility and various regional
offices. 

Many of our tractor and trailer
leases include a terminal rental adjustments clause TRAC ). Under these arrangements, at the end of the lease term and upon
the lessor s sale or disposition of the assets, if the amount received by the lessor is less than an amount predetermined and agreed
upon in the lease arrangement, or the TRAC value, the Company is liable to the Lessor and shall immediately pay to the Lessor the amount
of the deficiency as additional rental payments. The additional amount is typically limited to the TRAC value less a percentage of the
original fair value of the leased assets. The Company considers these potential incremental lease payments as residual value guarantees
and only includes the probable portion as lease payments upon lease commencement. 

The majority of our leases
include fixed rental payments. Certain of our lease agreements contain options or renewals that extend the lease term. Upon lease commencement,
we only reflect the payments related to options or renewals within the right of use asset and lease liability balances when the option
or renewals are reasonably certain to be exercised. The Company generally expects that it will renew lease agreements or enter new leases
as the existing leases expire. 

We have elected the practical
expedient to keep short-term leases (defined as less than 12 months without a purchase option that is likely to be exercised) off of our
balance sheet and the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components by class of underlying asset. 

When capitalizing right of
use assets and lease liabilities, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease, if it is readily available, otherwise, we use or our
incremental borrowing rate.

(a) Senior Credit Facilities
- In November 2021, the Company entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (Debt Agreement). The Debt Agreement matures
in November 2026. The Debt Agreement includes a 550.0 million reducing revolver loan and a 350.0 million revolving credit facility.
The reducing revolver loan commitment decreases by 25.0 million on each annual anniversary of the Debt Agreement. The Debt Agreement
is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and includes customary covenants
including a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain a minimum tangible net worth; at December 31, 2022, the Company was
in compliance with the financial covenant. 

At December 31, 2022, the Company s
outstanding debt balance under the Debt Agreement was 320.0 million. The reducing revolving loan and the revolving credit facility bear
interest at the Base Rate or the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Debt Agreement), plus a margin ranging from 0.5 to 2.75 depending upon
certain financial ratios and the rate selected. As of December 31, 2022 the interest rate on the reducing revolver credit facility
was 5.8 . 

Borrowings under the reducing
revolver loan and the revolving credit facility are available for the Company s working capital requirements, capital expenditures
and other general corporate purposes. Unused capacity under the revolving credit facility can also be used to issue letters of credit.
There were letters of credit aggregating 13.9 million outstanding at December 31, 2022. Amounts available under the revolving credit
facility are subject to a borrowing base calculation primarily comprised of receivable and inventory balances; amounts available under
the reducing revolver facility are constrained only by the annual reduction in the commitment amount. On December 31, 2022, after
deducting outstanding amounts and issued letters of credit, 285 million of the unused revolving credit facility and 205 million of the
reducing revolver commitment was available to the Company.

(b) Industrial Development
Revenue Bonds - Effective December 30, 2004, the Company entered into a transaction with the City of Dodge City, Kansas,
designed to provide property tax savings. Under the transaction, the City purchased the Company s Dodge City facility, or
the facility, by issuing 102.3 million in bonds due in December 2019, used the proceeds to purchase the facility and leased the
facility to the Company for an identical term under a capital lease. The Company purchased the City's bonds with proceeds of its term
loan under the Debt Agreement. Because the City has assigned the lease to the bond trustee for the benefit of the Company as the
sole bondholder, the Company, effectively controls enforcement of the lease against itself. As a result of the capital lease treatment,
the facility remains a component of property, plant and equipment in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. As a result
of the legal right of offset, the capital lease obligation and the corresponding bond investments have been eliminated in consolidation. 
The transaction provides the Company with property tax exemptions for the leased facility, that, after netting payments to the City and
local school district under payment in lieu of tax agreements, result in an annual property tax savings of approximately 25 . The
facility remains subject to a prior mortgage and security interest in favor of the lenders under the Debt Agreement. Additional
revenue bonds may be issued to cover the costs of certain improvements to this facility. The total amount of revenue bonds authorized
for issuance is 120.0 million. During 2019 the Company extended the basic term of the bonds based on the original agreement and exercised
its right to purchase the project. The purchase closed in 2020. 

The cities of Liberal and Dodge
City, Kansas issued an aggregate of 13.9 million of industrial development revenue bonds on the Company s behalf to fund the purchase
of equipment and construction improvements at the Company s facilities in those cities. These bonds were issued in four series of
 1.0 million, 1.0 million, 6.0 million and 5.9 million. Of the four series of bonds, only the 1.0 million and 1.0 million due on
demand or on February 1, 2029 and March 1, 2027, respectively remain outstanding. The bonds issued in 1999 and 2000 are variable
rate demand obligations that bear interest at a rate that is adjusted weekly, which rate will not exceed 10 per annum. The Company
has the option to redeem a series of bonds at any time for an amount equal to the principal plus accrued interest to the date of such
redemption. The holders of the bonds have the option to tender the bonds upon seven days notice for an amount equal to par plus
accrued interest. To the extent that the remarketing agent for the bonds is unable to resell any of the bonds that are tendered, the remarketing
agent could use the letter of credit to fund such tender. Because each series of bonds is backed by a letter of credit under our Debt
Agreement, these due-on-demand bonds have been presented as non-current obligations until twelve months prior to their maturity. 

On December 17,
2010, NBL entered into various agreements with the city of St. Joseph, Missouri, designed to provide the Company property tax savings. 
Under the transaction, the city of St. Joseph issued 12.7 million in bonds due in December 2022, used the proceeds to purchase the
equipment within the Leathers facility and subsequently leased the equipment back to us for an identical term under a capital lease. 
The Company purchased the City's bonds with proceeds of our term loan under the Debt Agreement. Because the city of St. Joseph has
assigned the lease to the bond trustee for our benefit as the sole bondholder, the Company, effectively controls enforcement of the lease
against ourselves. As a result of the capital lease treatment, the equipment remains a component of property, plant and equipment
in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. As a result of the legal right of offset, the capital lease obligation and the
corresponding bond investments have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Effective April 3, 2020, the
Company entered a transaction with the City of Liberal, Kansas, designed to provide property tax savings. Under the transaction, the City
purchased certain assets of the Company s Liberal, Kansas facility (the facility) by issuing federally taxable industrial revenue
bonds in an amount not to exceed 65.0 million with a stated maturity of December 31, 2032. The City then leased the assets to the Company
under a capital lease with a basic term expiring when any and all principal, redemption premium, and interest on said bonds are redeemed
and paid in full. The Company purchased the City s bonds with proceeds of its loans under the Debt Agreement. Because the City has
assigned the lease to the bond trustee for the benefit of the Company as the sole bondholder, the Company, effectively controls enforcement
of the lease against itself. As a result of the capital lease treatment, the facility remains a component of property, plant and equipment
in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. As a result of the legal right of offset, the capital lease obligation and the corresponding
bond investments have been eliminated in consolidation. The facility remains subject to a prior mortgage and security interest in favor
of the lenders under the Debt Agreement. The total amount of revenue bonds authorized for issuance is 65.0 million.

their annual compensation or the statutorily prescribed annual limit and have the amount of such reduction contributed to the
401(k) Plans. The 401(k) Plans provide for additional matching contributions by the Company, based on specific terms
contained in the 401(k) Plans. The trustees of the 401(k) Plans, at the direction of each participant, invest the assets
of the 401(k) Plan in designated investment options. The 401(k) Plans are intended to qualify under Section 401 of
the Internal Revenue Code. Expenses related to the 401(k) Plans totaled approximately 4.4 million, 4.0 million and 2.4
million for the fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

In January 2007, we entered
into an agreement with Empirical for Empirical to manufacture and install a grinding system in one of our plants. In accordance with
the agreement with Empirical, we are to pay Empirical a technology and support fee based on the number of pounds of product produced using
the grinding system. The installation of the grinding system was completed in fiscal year 2008. We paid approximately 1.5
million during 2022, 1.5 million during 2021 and 1.7 million during fiscal years 2020 to Empirical in technology and support fees. 

We are party to a long-term
cattle supply agreement with U.S. Premium Beef, LLC (US Premium Beef), a minority owner of the Company. Under this agreement we
have agreed to purchase from the members of US Premium Beef, and US Premium Beef has agreed to cause its members to deliver, 735,385 head
of cattle each year (subject to adjustment) at prices based on those published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, subject to adjustments

NOTE 9. DISCLOSURE ABOUT DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 

As part of the Company s
ongoing operations, the Company is exposed to market risks such as changes in commodity prices. To manage these risks, the Company
may enter into the following derivative instruments pursuant to our established policies: 

Forward purchase contracts for cattle for use in our beef plants 

Exchange traded futures contracts for cattle 

Exchange traded futures contracts for agricultural products 

F- 39 

NATIONAL BEEF PACKING COMPANY, LLC 

 AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

While management believes each
of these instruments help mitigate various market risks, they are not designated and accounted for as hedges as a result of the extensive
recordkeeping requirements associated with hedge accounting. Accordingly, the gains and losses associated with the change in fair
value of the instruments are recorded to net sales and cost of goods sold in the period of change. Certain firm commitments for
live cattle purchases and all firm commitments for boxed beef sales are purchased in the normal course of business and are treated as
normal purchases and sales and not recorded at fair value. 

The Company enters into certain
commodity derivatives, primarily with a diversified group of counterparties. The maximum amount of loss due to the credit risk of
the counterparties, should the counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of the contracts, is deemed to be immaterial as of
December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021. The exchange-traded contracts have been entered into under a master netting agreement. 
None of the derivatives entered into have credit-related contingent features.

NOTE 10. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES 

The Company is a defendant
in (i) five putative class action lawsuits in the United States District Court, Minnesota District alleging that it violated the Sherman
Antitrust Act, the Packers and Stockyards Act, the Commodity Exchange Act, and various state laws and (ii) putative class action antitrust
lawsuits in the Supreme Court of British Columbia and the Superior Court of Quebec, Montreal District, alleging that it violated the Canadian
Competition Act and various provincial laws (the Beef Antitrust Cases ). The Beef Antitrust Cases are entitled In
re Cattle Antitrust Litigation , which was filed originally on April 23, 2019, Peterson et al. v. JBS USA Food Company Holdings,
et al ., which was filed originally on April 26, 2019 ; In re DPP Beef Litigation , which was filed originally on April 26, 2019;
 Erbert Gerbert s, Inc. v. JBS USA Food Company Holdings, et al. , which was filed originally on June 18, 2020; Specht
v. Tyson Foods, Inc., et al. , which was filed originally on October 31, 2022; Giang Bui v. Cargill, Incorporated, et al. , which
was filed originally on February 18, 2022; and Sylvie De Bellefeuille v. Cargill, Inc. et al. , which was filed originally on March
24, 2022. Since the original filings, certain putative class members of the Peterson case
have opted out of the matter and are proceeding with individual direct actions making similar claims, and others may do so in the future. 
The plaintiffs in the Beef Antitrust Cases generally seek treble damages and other relief under the Sherman Antitrust Act and various
state laws or general damages, aggravated, exemplary, and punitive damages, injunctive relief, costs, and interest and other damages under
the Canadian Competition Act and various provincial laws. Some of Beef Antitrust Cases also allege that the Company violated the Packers
 Stockyards Act and the Commodities Exchange Act. In addition to the Beef Antitrust Cases, the Company is subject to investigations
by the United States Department of Justice (the DOJ and approximately 30 state attorneys general regarding fed cattle and
beef packing markets. The Company is cooperating with these investigations and is working with the Department of Justice and the
relevant states to provide information requested in connection with the investigations. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses
to the claims in the Antitrust Cases and any potential claims that might arise out of these government investigations and intends to defend
these matters vigorously. Given these factors and the stages of each of these matters, management believes a loss is not probable and
reasonably estimable at this time. 

The Company and one of its
subsidiaries are also defendants in a putative class action lawsuit entitled Brown, et al. v. JBS USA Food Company et al. and filed
in the United States District Court, Colorado District on November 16, 2022, alleging that (i) the
defendants directly and through a wage survey and benchmarking service exchanged information regarding labor rates in an effort to depress
and fix the rates of wages in violation of federal antitrust laws and (ii) one of the Company s subsidiaries entered into an employee
non-poach agreement with a competitor in violation of federal antitrust laws (the Wage Rate Case ). The plaintiffs seek,
among other things, treble monetary damages, punitive damages, restitution, and pre- and post-judgment interest, as well as declaratory
and injunctive relief. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims in the Wage Rate Case and intends to defend these
matters vigorously. Given these factors and the stage of this matter, management believes a loss is not probable and reasonably
estimable at this time. 

The Company is a party to various
other lawsuits and claims arising out of the operation of its business. Management believes the ultimate resolution of such matters should
not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

subsequent events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements through February 24,
