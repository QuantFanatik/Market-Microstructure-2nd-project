 PART I Item 1. Business General Dime Community Bancshares, Inc. (the Company is a bank holding company engaged in commercial banking and financial services through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dime Community Bank (the Bank ). The Bank was established in 1910 and is headquartered in Hauppauge, New York. The Holding Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1988 to serve as the holding company for the Bank. The Company functions primarily as the holder of all of the Bank s common stock. Our bank operations include Dime Community Inc., a real estate investment trust subsidiary and Dime Abstract LLC Dime Abstract ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank, which is a broker of title insurance services. For over a century, we have maintained our focus on building customer relationships in our market area. Our mission is to grow through the provision of exceptional service to our customers, our employees, and the community. We strive to achieve excellence in financial performance and build long-term shareholder value. We engage in providing full service commercial and consumer banking services, including accepting time, savings and demand deposits from the businesses, consumers, and local municipalities in our market area. These deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, are invested primarily in: (1) commercial real estate loans; (2) multi-family mortgage loans; (3) residential mortgage loans; (4) secured and unsecured commercial and consumer loans; (5) home equity loans; (6) construction and land loans; (7) Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB ), Federal National Mortgage Association Fannie Mae ), Government National Mortgage Association Ginnie Mae and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and other asset backed securities; (8) U.S. Treasury securities; (9) New York State and local municipal obligations; (10) U.S. government-sponsored enterprise U.S. GSE securities; and (11) corporate bonds. We also offer the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service CDARS and Insured Cash Sweep ICS programs, providing multi-millions of dollars of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insurance on deposits to our customers. In addition, we offer merchant credit and debit card processing, automated teller machines, cash management services, lockbox processing, online banking services, remote deposit capture, safe deposit boxes, and individual retirement accounts as well as investment services through Dime Financial Services LLC, which offers a full range of investment products and services through a third-party broker dealer. Through its title insurance subsidiary, the Bank acts as a broker for title insurance services. Our customer base is comprised principally of small and medium sized businesses, municipal relationships and consumer relationships. On February 1, 2021, Dime Community Bancshares, Inc., a Delaware corporation Legacy Dime merged with and into Bridge Bancorp, Inc., a New York corporation Bridge (the Merger ), with Bridge as the surviving corporation under the name Dime Community Bancshares, Inc. (the Holding Company ). At the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time ), each outstanding share of Legacy Dime common stock, par value 0.01 per share, was converted into the right to receive 0.6480 shares of the Holding Company s common stock, par value 0.01 per share. At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of Legacy Dime s Series A preferred stock, par value 0.01 (the Dime Preferred Stock ), was converted into the right to receive one share of a newly created series of the Holding Company s preferred stock having the same powers, preferences and rights as the Dime Preferred Stock. Immediately following the Merger, Dime Community Bank, a New York-chartered commercial bank and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Legacy Dime, merged with and into BNB Bank, a New York-chartered trust company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bridge, with BNB Bank as the surviving bank, under the name Dime Community Bank (the Bank ). As of December 31, 2022, we operated 59 branch locations throughout Long Island and the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, and the Bronx. Human Capital Resources Demographics and Culture As of December 31, 2022, we employed 823 full-time equivalent employees. Our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement. Our culture in the workplace encourages employees to care about each other, the

Table of Contents 
 communities they serve, and the work they do. We believe strong community ties, customer focus, accountability, and development of the communities in which we operate will have a favorable long-term impact on our business performance. Our employees are passionate and empowered to build relationships and provide customized banking solutions to the communities we serve. We believe in hiring well-qualified people from a wide range of backgrounds who align to values like integrity, innovation, and teamwork. As an equal opportunity employer, our decisions to select and promote employees are unbiased as we seek to build a diverse and inclusive team of employees. Labor Policies and Benefits We offer our employees a comprehensive benefits package that will support, maintain, and protect their physical, mental, and financial health. We sponsor various wellness programs that promote the health and wellness of our employees. In March 2020, the United States declared a National Public Health Emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which presented a challenge of maintaining the health and safety of our employees. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved, we pivoted the schedules of corporate staff to ensure their safety while still providing support to our customers. Our branch network remained operational with minimal disruption throughout the pandemic. Training, Development and Retention We are committed to retaining employees by being competitive in providing cash and non-cash rewards, benefits, recognition, and professional development opportunities. We offered an 8-week summer internship program through local colleges that provided students with valuable experience in the professional fields they are considering career paths. It also provides a post-graduation pipeline of future employees. In addition, we maintain equity incentive plans under which we may issue shares of our common stock. Refer to Note 20. Stock-Based Compensation of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details of our equity incentive plans. We promote career development and continuing education by offering internal training programs and tuition reimbursement for programs that develop skills related to our business. Competition and Principal Market Areas All phases of our business are highly competitive. We face direct competition from a significant number of financial institutions operating in our market area, many with a statewide or regional presence, and in some cases, a national presence. There is also competition for banking business from competitors outside of our market areas. Most of these competitors are significantly larger than us, and therefore have greater financial and marketing resources and lending limits than us. The fixed cost of regulatory compliance remains high for community banks as compared to their larger competitors that are able to achieve economies of scale. We consider our major competition to be local commercial banks as well as other commercial banks with branches in our market area. Other competitors include savings banks, credit unions, mortgage brokers and other financial services firms, such as investment and insurance companies. Increased competition within our market areas may limit growth and profitability. The title insurance subsidiary also faces competition from other title insurance brokers as well as directly from the companies that underwrite title insurance. In New York State, title insurance is obtained on most transfers of real estate and mortgage transactions. Our principal market area is Greater Long Island, which includes the counties of Kings, Queens, Nassau and Suffolk, and Manhattan. Industries represented across the principal market areas include retail establishments; construction and trades; restaurants and bars; lodging and recreation; professional entities; real estate; health services; passenger transportation; high-tech manufacturing; and agricultural and related businesses. Given its proximity, Long Island s economy is closely linked with New York City s and major employers in the area include municipalities, school districts, hospitals, and financial institutions. Taxation The Holding Company, the Bank and its subsidiaries, with the exception of the real estate investment trust, which files its own federal and state income tax returns, report their income on a consolidated basis using the accrual method of accounting and are subject to federal taxation as well as income tax of the State, City of New York and the State of New Jersey. In general, banks are subject to federal income tax in the same manner as other corporations. However, gains and 
 6 

Table of Contents 
 losses realized by banks from the sale of available-for-sale securities are generally treated as ordinary income, rather than capital gains or losses. The taxation of net income is similar to federal taxable income subject to certain modifications. Regulation and Supervision Dime Community Bank The Bank is a New York State-chartered trust company and a member of the Federal Reserve System (a member bank ). The lending, investment, and other business operations of the Bank are governed by New York and federal laws and regulations. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the New York State Department of Financial Services NYSDFS and, as a member bank, by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System FRB ). The Bank s deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC under its Deposit Insurance Fund DIF and the FDIC has certain regulatory authority as deposit insurer. A summary of the primary laws and regulations that govern the Bank s operations are set forth below. Loans and Investments The powers of a New York commercial bank are established by New York law and applicable federal law. New York commercial banks have authority to originate and purchase any type of loan, including commercial, commercial real estate, residential mortgages or consumer loans. Aggregate loans by a state commercial bank to any single borrower or group of related borrowers are generally limited to 15 of the Bank s capital and surplus, plus an additional 10 if secured by specified readily marketable collateral. Federal and state law and regulations limit the Bank s investment authority. Generally, a state member bank is prohibited from investing in corporate equity securities for its own account other than the equity securities of companies through which the bank conducts its business. Under federal and state regulations, a New York state member bank may invest in investment securities for its own account up to a specified limit depending upon the type of security. Investment Securities are generally defined as marketable obligations that are investment grade and not predominantly speculative in nature. Applicable regulations classify investment securities into five different types and, depending on its type, a state member bank may have the authority to deal in and underwrite the security. New York-chartered state member banks may also purchase certain non-investment securities that can be reclassified and underwritten as loans. Lending Standards The federal banking agencies adopted uniform regulations prescribing standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens on interests in real estate or made for the purpose of financing the construction of a building or other improvements to real estate. Under these regulations, all insured depository institutions, like the Bank, adopted and maintain written policies that establish appropriate limits and standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens or interests in real estate or are made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate. These policies must establish loan portfolio diversification standards, prudent underwriting standards (including loan-to-value limits) that are clear and measurable, loan administration procedures, and documentation, approval and reporting requirements. The real estate lending policies must reflect consideration of the Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate Lending Policies that have been adopted by the federal bank regulators. Federal Deposit Insurance The Bank is a member of the DIF, which is administered by the FDIC. Our deposit accounts are insured by the FDIC. Effective July 22, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act permanently raised the deposit insurance available on all deposit accounts to 250,000 with a retroactive effective date of January 1, 2008. The FDIC assesses insured depository institutions to maintain the DIF. Under the FDIC s risk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less risky pay lower assessments. Assessments for institutions with 10 billion or more of assets are primarily based on a scorecard approach by the FDIC, including factors such as examination ratings, financial measures, and modeling measuring the institution s ability to withstand asset-related and funding-related stress and potential loss to 
 7 

Table of Contents 
 the DIF in the event of the institution s failure. The assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments specified by the regulations) for institutions with total assets of more than 10 billion was 1.5 to 40 basis points effective through December 31, 2022. The FDIC has the authority to increase insurance assessments and adopted a final rule in October 2022 to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rates beginning in the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. As a result, effective January 1, 2023, assessment rates for institutions of the Bank s size will range from 3.5 to 42 basis points. Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. The Company does not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance. Capitalization Federal regulations require FDIC insured depository institutions, including state member banks, to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5 , a tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0 , a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8.0 , and a tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio of 4.0 . The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. Common equity tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity tier 1 and additional tier 1 capital. Additional tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes tier 1 capital (common equity tier 1 capital plus additional tier 1 capital) and tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, and subordinated debt. Also included in tier 2 capital is the allowance for credit losses limited to a maximum of 1.25 of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI ), up to 45 of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out, (Dime has exercised), have AOCI incorporated into common equity tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0 is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50 is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one-to-four family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100 is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150 is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0 to 600 is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors. In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5 of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. Safety and Soundness Standards Each federal banking agency, including the FRB, has adopted guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees, and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive

Table of Contents 
 when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder. On April 26, 2016, the federal regulatory agencies approved a second proposed joint rulemaking to implement Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits incentive-based compensation that encourages inappropriate risk taking. In addition, the NYSDFS issued guidance applicable to incentive compensation in October 2016. Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take prompt corrective action with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the statute establishes five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. The FRB may order member banks which have insufficient capital to take corrective actions. For example, a bank, which is categorized as undercapitalized would be subject to other growth limitations, would be required to submit a capital restoration plan, and a holding company that controls such a bank would be required to guarantee that the bank complies with the restoration plan. A significantly undercapitalized bank would be subject to additional restrictions. Member banks deemed by the FRB to be critically undercapitalized would be subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. The final rule that increased regulatory capital standards adjusted the prompt corrective action tiers as of January 1, 2015. The various categories were revised to incorporate the new common equity tier 1 capital requirement, the increase in the tier 1 to risk-based assets requirement and other changes. Under the revised prompt corrective action requirements, insured depository institutions are required to meet the following in order to qualify as well capitalized: (1) a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5 (new standard); (2) a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 (increased from 6.0 ); (3) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 (unchanged); and (4) a tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0 (unchanged). Dividends Under federal law and applicable regulations, a New York member bank may generally declare a dividend, without prior regulatory approval, in an amount equal to its year-to-date retained net income plus the prior two years retained net income that is still available for dividend. Dividends exceeding those amounts require application to and approval by the NYSDFS and FRB. In addition, a member bank may be limited in paying cash dividends if it does not maintain the capital conservation buffer described previously under Capitalization. Liquidity Pursuant to FDIC regulations , the Bank is required to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operation. Branching Subject to certain limitations, NYS and federal law permit NYS-chartered banks to establish branches in any state of the United States. In general, federal law allows the FDIC, and the NYBL allows the Superintendent, to approve an application by a state banking institution to acquire interstate branches by merger. The NYBL authorizes NYS-chartered banks to open and occupy de novo branches outside the State of New York. Pursuant to the Reform Act, the FDIC is authorized to approve the establishment by a state bank of a de novo interstate branch if the intended host state allows de novo branching within that state by banks chartered by that state. Acquisitions Under the Federal Bank Merger Act, prior approval of the FDIC is required for the Bank to merge with or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another insured depository institution. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the FDIC will consider, among other factors, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or

 financial system, the applicant s performance record under the CRA (see Community Reinvestment and its compliance with fair housing and other consumer protection laws and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities. Privacy and Security Protection The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations for consumer privacy protection that require financial institutions to adopt procedures to protect customers and their non-public personal information. The regulations require the Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares non-public personal information, to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship, and annually thereafter if there are changes to its policy. In addition, the Bank is required to provide its customers the ability to opt-out of: (1) the sharing of their personal information with unaffiliated third parties if the sharing of such information does not satisfy any of the permitted exceptions; and (2) the receipt of marketing solicitations from Bank affiliates. The Bank is additionally subject to regulatory guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information. The guidelines describe the federal banking agencies expectations for the creation, implementation and maintenance of an information security program, including administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities. The standards set forth in the guidelines are intended to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, and protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial customer harm or inconvenience. Federal law additionally permits each state to enact legislation that is more protective of consumers personal information. There are periodically privacy bills considered by the New York legislature. Management of the Company cannot predict the impact, if any, of these bills if enacted. Cybersecurity more broadly has become a focus of federal and state regulators. In March 2015, federal regulators issued two statements regarding cybersecurity to reiterate regulatory expectations regarding cyberattacks compromising credentials and business continuity planning to ensure the rapid recovery of an institution s operations after a cyberattack involving destructive malware. In October 2016, federal regulators jointly issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cyber risk management standards that are intended to increase the operational resilience of large and interconnected entities under their supervision. Once established, the enhanced cyber risk management standards would help to reduce the potential impact of a cyber-attack or other cyber-related failure on the financial system. The advance notice of proposed rulemaking addressed five categories of cyber standards: (1) cyber risk governance; (2) cyber risk management; (3) internal dependency management; (4) external dependency management; and (5) incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness. In March 2017, the NYSDFS made effective regulations that require financial institutions regulated by the NYSDFS, including the Bank, to, among other things, (i) establish and maintain a cyber security program designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their information systems; (ii) implement and maintain a written cyber security policy setting forth policies and procedures for the protection of their information systems and nonpublic information; and (iii) designate a Chief Information Security Officer. In January 2020, the FDIC issued a Statement on Heightened Cybersecurity Risk to remind regulated institutions of sound cybersecurity risk management principles. In addition, in November 2021, the federal banking agencies published a final rule that, among other things, requires banking organizations to notify their primary federal regulator as soon as possible and no later than 36 hours after the discovery of a computer-security incident that rises to the level of a notification incident within the meaning attributed to those terms by the final rule. The Company will continue to monitor any developments related to these proposed rulemakings as part of its ongoing cyber risk management. See Item 1A - Risk Factors for a further discussion of cybersecurity risks. Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act govern transactions between a member bank and its affiliates, which includes the Company. The FRB has adopted Regulation W, which comprehensively implements and interprets Sections 23A and 23B, in part by codifying prior FRB interpretations under Sections 23A and 23B. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. A subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution or a financial subsidiary under federal law is not treated 
 10 

Table of Contents 
 as an affiliate of the bank for the purposes of Sections 23A and 23B; however, the FRB has the discretion to treat subsidiaries of a bank as affiliates on a case-by-case basis. Sections 23A and 23B limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10 of such bank s capital stock and surplus, and limit all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20 of such capital stock and surplus. The statutory sections also require that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. The term covered transaction includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of guarantees and other similar types of transactions. Further, most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100 to 130 percent of the loan amounts. In addition, any covered transaction by an association with an affiliate and any purchase of assets or services by an association from an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the bank as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate. A bank s loans to its executive officers, directors, any owner of more than 10 of its stock (each, an insider) and any of certain entities affiliated with any such person (an insider s related interest) are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and the FRB s Regulation O thereunder. Under these restrictions, the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and the insider s related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to national banks. All loans by a bank to all insiders and insiders related interests in the aggregate may not exceed the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. With certain exceptions, loans to an executive officer, other than loans for the education of the officer s children and certain loans secured by the officer s residence, may not exceed the greater of 25,000 or 2.5 of the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, but in no event more than 100,000. Regulation O also requires that any proposed loan to an insider or a related interest of that insider be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank, with any interested director not participating in the voting, if such loan, when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider and the insider s related interests, would exceed either 500,000 or the greater of 25,000 or 5 of the bank s unimpaired capital and surplus. Generally, such loans must be made on substantially the same terms as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are no less stringent than, those that are prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and must not present more than a normal risk of collectability. An exception is made for extensions of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the bank and that does not give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees of the bank. Examinations and Assessments The Bank is required to file periodic reports with and is subject to periodic examination by the NYSDFS and the FRB. Applicable laws and regulations generally require periodic on-site examinations and annual audits by independent public accountants for all insured institutions. The Bank is required to pay an annual assessment to the NYSDFS to fund its supervision. Federal law provides that institutions with more than 10 billion in total assets, such as the Bank, are examined by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB ), rather than its primary federal bank regulator, as to compliance with certain federal consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations. Community Reinvestment Act Under the federal Community Reinvestment Act CRA ), the Bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the FRB, in connection with its examination of the Bank, to assess its record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take that record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the Bank. For example, the regulations specify that a bank s CRA performance will be considered in its expansion (e.g., branching or mergers) proposals and may be the basis for approving, denying or conditioning the approval of an application. On May 5, 2022, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation released a notice of propose rulemaking to strengthen and modernize the CRA regulations and framework. As of the date

Table of Contents 
 of its most recent CRA examination, which was conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the NYSDFS, the Bank s CRA performance was rated Outstanding . New York law imposes a similar obligation on the Bank to serve the credit needs of its community. New York law contains its own CRA provisions, which are substantially similar to federal law. USA PATRIOT Act The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 gave the federal government new powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. The USA PATRIOT Act also required the federal banking agencies to take into consideration the effectiveness of controls designed to combat money-laundering activities in determining whether to approve a merger or other acquisition application of a member institution. Accordingly, if the Bank engages in a merger or other acquisition, the Bank s controls designed to combat money laundering would be considered as part of the application process. The Bank has established policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations. Dime Community Bancshares, Inc. The Holding Company, as a bank holding company controlling the Bank, is subject to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended BHCA ), and the rules and regulations of the FRB under the BHCA applicable to bank holding companies. We are required to file reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of the FRB. The FRB previously adopted consolidated capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies structured similarly, but not identically, to those applicable to the Bank. The Dodd-Frank Act directed the FRB to issue consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves. The FRB subsequently issued regulations amending its regulatory capital requirements to implement the Dodd-Frank Act as to bank holding company capital standards. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary banks applied to bank holding companies as of January 1, 2015. As is the case with institutions themselves, the capital conservation buffer was phased-in between 2016 and 2019. We met all capital adequacy requirements under the FRB s capital rules on December 31, 2022. The policy of the FRB is that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks by providing capital and other support in times of distress. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength policy. Under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal law, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank is required to guarantee, within specified limits, the capital restoration plan that is required of an undercapitalized bank. If an undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement an accepted plan, the FRB may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized bank from paying dividends or making any other capital distribution. As a bank holding company, we are required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB to acquire more than 5 of a class of voting securities of any additional bank or bank holding company or to acquire all, or substantially all, the assets of any additional bank or bank holding company. In addition, the bank holding companies may generally only engage in activities that are closely related to banking as determined by the FRB. Bank holding companies that meet certain criteria may opt to become a financial holding company and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities. FRB policy is that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company s net income is sufficient to fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention is consistent with the company s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. In addition, FRB guidance sets forth the supervisory expectation that bank holding companies will inform and consult with FRB staff in advance of issuing a dividend that exceeds earnings for the quarter and should inform the FRB and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends if (i) net income available to stockholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (ii) prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the bank holding company s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition, or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or

 is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. Moreover, the guidance indicates that a bank holding company should notify the FRB in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period (e.g., quarter) for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the organization s capital structure. FRB guidance also provides for consultation and nonobjection for material increases in the amount of a bank holding company s common stock dividend. Current FRB regulations provide that a bank holding company that is not well capitalized or well managed, as such terms are defined in the regulations, or that is subject to any unresolved supervisory issues, is required to give the FRB prior written notice of any repurchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for repurchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such repurchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, will be equal to 10 or more of the company s consolidated net worth. The FRB may disapprove such a repurchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice or violate a law or regulation. FRB guidance generally provides for bank holding company consultation with FRB staff prior to engaging in a repurchase or redemption of a bank holding company s stock, even if a formal written notice is not required. The guidance provides that the purpose of such consultation is to allow the FRB to review the proposed repurchases or redemption from a supervisory perspective and possibly object. The NYSDFS and FRB have extensive enforcement authority over the institutions and holding companies that they regulate to prohibit or correct activities that violate law, regulation or a regulatory agreement or which are deemed to be unsafe or unsound banking practices. Enforcement actions may include: the appointment of a conservator or receiver for an institution; the issuance of a cease and desist order; the termination of deposit insurance; the imposition of civil money penalties on the institution, its directors, officers, employees and institution-affiliated parties; the issuance of directives to increase capital; the issuance of formal and informal agreements; the removal of or restrictions on directors, officers, employees and institution-affiliated parties; and the enforcement of any such mechanisms through restraining orders or other court actions. Any change in applicable New York or federal laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on us and our operations and stockholders. We file certain reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC under the federal securities laws. Our operations are also subject to extensive regulation by other federal, state and local governmental authorities and it is subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of its operations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance, in all material respects, with applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and regulations applicable to it are subject to regular modification and change. There can be no assurance that these proposed laws, rules and regulations, or any other laws, rules or regulations, will not be adopted in the future, which could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or prospects.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to our Loan Portfolio The concentration of our loan portfolio in loans secured by commercial, multi-family and residential real estate properties located in Greater Long Island and Manhattan could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations if general economic conditions or real estate values in this area decline. Unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified, our loan portfolio consists primarily of real estate loans secured by commercial, multi-family and residential real estate properties located in Greater Long Island and Manhattan. The local economic conditions in Greater Long Island and Manhattan have a significant impact on the volume of loan originations and the quality of loans, the ability of borrowers to repay these loans, and the value of collateral securing these loans. A considerable decline in the general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond our control would impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, decreases in tenant occupancy may also have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings. If our regulators impose limitations on our commercial real estate lending activities, earnings could be adversely affected. In 2006, the federal bank regulatory agencies (collectively, the Agencies issued joint guidance entitled Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices (the CRE Guidance ). Although the CRE Guidance did not establish specific lending limits, it provides that a bank s commercial real estate lending exposure may receive increased supervisory scrutiny where total non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate and construction and land loans, represent 300 or more of an institution s total risk-based capital and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50 or more during the preceding 36 months. The Consolidated Company s non-owner occupied commercial real estate level equaled 554 of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2022. Including owner-occupied commercial real estate, the Consolidated Company s ratio of commercial real estate loans to total risk-based capital ratio would be 636 at December 31, 2022. If our regulators were to impose restrictions on the amount of commercial real estate loans we can hold in our portfolio, or require higher capital ratios as a result of the level of commercial real estate loans held, our earnings would be adversely affected. The performance of our multi-family real estate loans could be adversely impacted by regulation. Multi-family real estate loans generally involve a greater risk than residential real estate loans because of legislation and government regulations involving rent control and rent stabilization, which are outside the control of the borrower or the Bank, and could impair the value of the security for the loan or the future cash flow of such properties. For example, on June 14, 2019, the State of New York enacted legislation increasing the restrictions on rent increases in a rent-regulated apartment building, including, among other provisions, (i) repealing the vacancy bonus and longevity bonus, which allowed a property owner to raise rents as much as 20 each time a rental unit became vacant, (ii) eliminating high rent vacancy deregulation and high-income deregulation, which allowed a rental unit to be removed from rent stabilization once it crossed a statutory high-rent threshold and became vacant, or the tenant s income exceeded the statutory amount in the preceding two years, and (iii) eliminating an exception that allowed a property owner who offered preferential rents to tenants to raise the rent to the full legal rent upon renewal. The legislation still permits a property owner to charge up to the full legal rent once the tenant vacates. As a result of this legislation as well as previously existing laws and regulations, it is possible that rental income might not rise sufficiently over time to satisfy increases in the loan rate at repricing or increases in overhead expenses e.g. , utilities, taxes, etc.). In addition, if the cash flow from a collateral property is reduced e.g. , if leases are not obtained or renewed), the borrower s ability to repay the loan and the value of the security for the loan may be impaired.

 Increases to the allowance for credit losses may cause our earnings to decrease. Customers may not repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral securing the payment of those loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. Hence, we may experience significant credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Since the first quarter of 2021, we have been required to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for credit losses. This method of loan loss accounting represents a change from the previous method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, and greatly increased the types of data we need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we rely on loan quality reviews, our past loss experience and that of our peer group, and an evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover expected losses in the loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance for credit losses. Material additions to the allowance for credit losses through charges to earnings would materially decrease our net income. Additionally, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for credit losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and/or financial condition. We are subject to the CRA and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties. The CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. With respect to the Bank, the NYSDFS, FRB, CFPB, the United States Department of Justice and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity and restrictions on expansion. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company is subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities. A significant portion of the Company s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, the Company may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, the Company may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require the Company to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit the Company s ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the Company s exposure to environmental liability. Environmental reviews of real property before initiating foreclosure may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Interest Rates Changes in interest rates could affect our profitability. Our ability to earn a profit, like most financial institutions, depends primarily on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the interest 
 15 

Table of Contents 
 expense that we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Our profitability depends on our ability to manage our assets and liabilities during periods of changing market interest rates. During 2022, in response to accelerated inflation, the Federal Reserve implemented monetary tightening policies, resulting in significantly increased interest rates. In a period of rising interest rates, the interest income earned on our assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest paid on our liabilities. A sustained decrease in market interest rates could also adversely affect our earnings. When interest rates decline, borrowers tend to refinance higher-rate, fixed-rate loans at lower rates. Under those circumstances, we may not be able to reinvest those prepayments in assets earning interest rates as high as the rates on those prepaid loans or in investment securities. Changes in interest rates also affect the fair value of the securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, the securities portfolio totaled 1.54 billion. Management is unable to predict fluctuations of market interest rates, which are affected by many factors, including inflation, recession, unemployment, monetary policy, domestic and international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets, and investor and consumer demand. We are required to transition from the use of LIBOR. We have material contracts that are indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR ). In 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulated LIBOR, announced that the publication of LIBOR would not be guaranteed after 2021. LIBOR will be discontinued after June 2023. There have been ongoing efforts to establish an alternative reference rate to LIBOR. Regulators, industry groups and certain committees (e.g. the Alternative Reference Rates Committee) have published recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for LIBOR (e.g. the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR ), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating-rate financial instruments. The March 2022 enactment of the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act and the Federal Reserve s proposed regulations addressed the discontinuation of LIBOR and established a replacement benchmark rate, based on SOFR, that will automatically apply to agreements that rely on LIBOR and do not have an alternative contractual fallback benchmark. These SOFR-based replacement benchmarks may also apply automatically to contracts with fallback provisions that authorize a particular person to determine the replacement benchmark. We have analyzed our LIBOR-indexed contracts, the significant majority of which already provided for a fallback rate. Where the fallback rate is not specified or is no longer considered an economic equivalent to the LIBOR-derived rate previously used, we are working with counterparties to agree upon a replacement rate and have generally selected the rate recommended by the Federal Reserve. While the LIBOR Act and implementing regulations will help to transition legacy LIBOR contracts to a new benchmark rate, the substitution of SOFR for LIBOR may have economic impacts on parties to affected contracts. When LIBOR rates are no longer available and we are required to implement substitute indices for the calculation of interest rates, we may incur expenses in effecting the transition, and may be subject to disputes or litigation with customers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, since alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. There may be changes in the rules or methodologies used to calculate SOFR or other benchmark rates, which may have an adverse effect on the value of or return on financial assets and liabilities that are based on or are linked to those rates. Risks Related to Regulation We operate in a highly regulated environment, Federal and state regulators periodically examine our business, and we may be required to remediate adverse examination findings. The FRB and the NYSDFS periodically examine our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a federal banking agency were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset 
 16 

Table of Contents 
 quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were in violation of any law or regulation, we may take a number of different remedial actions as we deem appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin unsafe or unsound practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance and place it into receivership or conservatorship. If we become subject to any regulatory actions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects. Additionally, the CFPB has the authority to issue consumer finance regulations and is authorized, individually or jointly with bank regulatory agencies, to conduct investigations to determine whether any person is, or has, engaged in conduct that violates new and existing consumer financial laws or regulations. Banks with assets in excess of 10 billion are subject to requirements imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act and its implemented regulations, including the examination authority of the CFPB to assess our compliance with federal consumer financial laws, imposition of higher FDIC premiums, reduced debit card interchange fees, and enhanced risk management frameworks, all of which increase operating costs and reduce earnings. In addition, in accordance with a memorandum of understanding entered into between the CFPB and U.S. Department of Justice, the two agencies have agreed to coordinate efforts related to enforcing the fair lending laws, which includes information sharing and conducting joint investigations, and have done so on a number of occasions. We face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the federal Bank Secrecy Act (the BSA and other anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing statutes and regulations. The BSA, the USA PATRIOT Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among others, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering compliance program and to file reports such as suspicious activity reports and currency transaction reports. Our products and services, including our debit card issuing business, are subject to an increasingly strict set of legal and regulatory requirements intended to protect consumers and to help detect and prevent money laundering, terrorist financing and other illicit activities. We are required to comply with these and other anti-money laundering requirements. The federal banking agencies and the U.S. Treasury Department s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network are authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and have recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts against banks and other financial services providers with the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the regulations administered and enforced by the U.S. Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control. If we violate these laws and regulations, or our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the ability to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including acquisitions. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Risks Related to our Debt Securities The subordinated debentures that we issued have rights that are senior to those of our common shareholders. In 2015, the Company issued 40.0 million of 5.75 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Debentures due 2030. In 2022, the Company issued 160.0 million of 5.00 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Debentures due 2032. Because these subordinated debentures rank senior to our common stock, if we fail to make timely principal and interest payments on the subordinated debentures, we may not pay any dividends on our common stock. Further, if we declare bankruptcy, dissolve 
 17 

Table of Contents 
 or liquidate, we must satisfy all of our subordinated debenture obligations before we may pay any distributions on our common stock. Strategic Risks Expansion of our branch network may adversely affect our financial results. We cannot be certain that the opening of new branches will be accretive to earnings or that it will be accretive to earnings within a reasonable period of time. Numerous factors contribute to the performance of a new branch, such as suitable location, qualified personnel, and an effective marketing strategy. Additionally, it takes time for a new branch to gather sufficient loans and deposits to generate income sufficient to cover its operating expenses. Difficulties we experience in opening new branches may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Mergers and acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company has in the past and may in the future pursue mergers and acquisitions opportunities. Mergers and acquisitions involve a number of risks and challenges, including the expenses involved; potential diversion of management s attention from other strategic matters; integration of branches and operations acquired; outflow of customers from the acquired branches; retention of personnel from acquired companies or branches; competing effectively in geographic areas not previously served; managing growth resulting from the transaction; and dilution in the acquirer s book and tangible book value per share. Our growth or future losses may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or the cost of that capital may be very high. We are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. While we anticipate that our capital resources will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future, we may at some point need to raise additional capital to support our operations or continued growth, both internally and through acquisitions. Any capital we obtain may result in the dilution of the interests of existing holders of our common stock, or otherwise adversely affect your investment. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot make assurances of our ability to raise additional capital if needed, or if the terms will be acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. Operational Risk Factors Our business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, declines in housing and real estate valuations, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; geopolitical conflicts; natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors. The Company s performance could be negatively affected to the extent there is deterioration in business and economic conditions, including persistent inflation, an inverted yield curve, rising prices, and supply chain issues or labor shortages, which have direct or indirect material adverse impacts on us, our customers, and our counterparties. Recessionary conditions may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the financial condition of our borrowers, the value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Declines in real estate values and sales volumes and increased unemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies, increases in our 
 18 

Table of Contents 
 levels of nonperforming and classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services. Such events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital, liquidity, and financial condition. Strong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability. Our primary market area is located in Greater Long Island and Manhattan. Competition in the banking and financial services industry remains intense. Our profitability depends on the continued ability to successfully compete. We compete with commercial banks, savings banks, credit unions, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than us and may offer certain services that we do not provide. In addition, competitors may offer deposits at higher rates and loans with lower fixed rates, more attractive terms and less stringent credit structures than we have been willing to offer. Our future success depends on the success and growth of Dime Community Bank. Our primary business activity for the foreseeable future will be to act as the holding company of the Bank. Therefore, our future profitability will depend on the success and growth of this subsidiary. The continued and successful implementation of our growth strategy will require, among other things that we increase our market share by attracting new customers that currently bank at other financial institutions in our market area. In addition, our ability to successfully grow will depend on several factors, including favorable market conditions, the competitive responses from other financial institutions in our market area, and our ability to maintain good asset quality. While we believe we have the management resources, market opportunities and internal systems in place to obtain and successfully manage future growth, growth opportunities may not be available, and we may not be successful in continuing our growth strategy. In addition, continued growth requires that we incur additional expenses, including salaries, data processing and occupancy expense related to new branches and related support staff. Many of these increased expenses are considered fixed expenses. Unless we can successfully continue our growth, our results of operations could be negatively affected by these increased costs. The loss of key personnel could impair our future success. Our future success depends in part on the continued service of our executive officers, other key management, and staff, as well as our ability to continue to attract, motivate, and retain additional highly qualified employees. The loss of services of one or more of our key personnel or our inability to timely recruit replacements for such personnel, or to otherwise attract, motivate, or retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our business may be adversely affected by fraud and other financial crimes. Our loans to businesses and individuals and our deposit relationships and related transactions are subject to exposure to the risk of loss due to fraud and other financial crimes. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent such losses, losses may still occur. In the past, we have experienced losses due to fraud. Risks associated with system failures, interruptions, or breaches of security could negatively affect our operations and earnings. Information technology systems are critical to our business. We collect, process and store sensitive customer data by utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated by us and third-party service providers. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition, any compromise of our systems could deter customers from using our products and services. Although we take numerous protective measures and otherwise endeavor to protect and maintain the privacy and security of confidential data, these systems may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, other malicious code, cyberattacks, including distributed denial of service attacks, cyber-theft and other events that could have a security impact. If one or more of such events were to occur, this

 potentially could jeopardize confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our systems or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or our customers operations. In addition, we maintain interfaces with certain third-party service providers. If these third-party service providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel. The occurrence of any system failures, interruption, or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, thereby subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are not fully covered by our insurance. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are exposed to cyber-security risks, including denial of service, hacking, and identity theft. There have been well-publicized distributed denials of service attacks on large financial services companies. Distributed denial of service attacks are designed to saturate the targeted online network with excessive amounts of network traffic, resulting in slow response times, or in some cases, causing the site to be temporarily unavailable. Hacking and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving, and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks. We may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize these risks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss. Public health emergencies like the COVID-19 outbreak may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant economic dislocation in the United States. Certain industries were particularly hard-hit, including the travel and hospitality industry, the restaurant industry and the retail industry. Additionally, the spread of COVID-19 temporarily caused us to modify our business practices, including placing restrictions on employee travel and implementing remote work practices. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or any other public health emergency, and related governmental responses to any outbreak, we may be subject to the following risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations: demand for our products and services may decline; if consumer and business activities are restricted, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase, resulting in increased charges and reduced income; collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could increase loan losses; our allowance for credit losses may have to be increased if borrowers experience financial difficulties; a material decrease in net income or a net loss over several quarters could affect our ability to pay cash dividends; cyber security risks may be increased as the result of an increase in the number of employees working remotely; critical services provided by third-party vendors may become unavailable; and the Company may experience unanticipated unavailability or loss of key employees, harming our ability to execute our business strategy. Severe weather, acts of terrorism and other external events could impact our ability to conduct business. Weather-related events have adversely impacted our market area in recent years, especially areas located near coastal waters and flood prone areas. Such events that may cause significant flooding and other storm-related damage may become more common events in the future. Financial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising operating and communication systems and the metropolitan New York area remains a central target for potential acts of terrorism. Such events could cause significant damage, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing repayment of loans, and result in the loss of revenue. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. Additionally, global markets may be adversely affected by natural disasters, the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, cyberattacks or campaigns, military conflict, terrorism or other geopolitical events. Global market fluctuations may affect our business liquidity. Also, any sudden or prolonged market downturn in the U.S. or

 abroad, as a result of the above factors or otherwise could result in a decline in revenue and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including capital and liquidity levels. Damage to the Company s reputation could adversely impact our business. The Company s reputation is important to our success. Our ability to attract and retain customers, investors, employees and advisors may depend upon external perceptions of the Company. Damage to the Company s reputation could cause significant harm to our business and prospects and may arise from numerous sources, including litigation or regulatory actions, compliance failures, customer services failures, or unethical behavior or misconduct of employees, advisors and counterparties. Adverse developments with respect to the financial services industry may also, by association, negatively impact the Company s reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny of or litigation against the Company. Furthermore, shareholders and other stakeholders have begun to consider how corporations are addressing environmental, social and governance ESG issues. Governments, investors, customers and the general public are increasingly focused on ESG practices and disclosures, and views about ESG are diverse and rapidly changing. These shifts in investing priorities may result in adverse effects on the trading price of the Company s common stock if investors determine that the Company has not made sufficient progress on ESG matters. The Company could also face potential negative ESG-related publicity in traditional media or social media if shareholders or other stakeholders determine that we have not adequately considered or addressed ESG matters. If the Company, or our relationships with certain customers, vendors or suppliers became the subject of negative publicity, our ability to attract and retain customers and employees, and our financial condition and results of operations, could be adversely impacted. Accounting-Related Risks Changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results. Our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial results and condition. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Some of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If such estimates or assumptions underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses. From time to time, the FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of our external financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be hard to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations and financial condition. We could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements in material amounts. If we determine our goodwill or other intangible assets to be impaired, the Company s financial condition and results of operations would be negatively affected. When the Company completes a business combination, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The amount of the purchase price which is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired. At least annually (or more frequently if indicators arise), the Company evaluates goodwill for impairment. If the Company determines goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired, the Company will be required to write down these assets. Any write-down would have a negative effect on the consolidated financial statements. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise mentioned, the terms the Company , we , us and our refer to Dime Community Bancshares, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Dime Community Bank (the Bank ). We use the term Holding Company to refer solely to Dime Community Bancshares, Inc. and not to our consolidated subsidiary. Overview Dime Community Bancshares, Inc., a New York corporation, is a bank holding company formed in 1988. On a parent-only basis, the Holding Company has minimal operations, other than as owner of Dime Community Bank. The Holding Company is dependent on dividends from its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dime Community Bank, its own earnings, additional capital raised, and borrowings as sources of funds. The information in this report reflects principally the financial condition and results of operations of the Bank. The Bank s results of operations are primarily dependent on its net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. The Bank also generates non-interest income, such as fee income on deposit and loan accounts, merchant credit and debit card processing programs, loan swap fees, investment services, income from its title insurance subsidiary, and net gains on sales of securities and loans. The level of non-interest expenses, such as salaries and benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, other general and administrative expenses, expenses from the Bank s title insurance subsidiary, and income tax expense, further affects our net income. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts and the related discussion and analysis to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications did not have an impact on net income or total stockholders equity. COVID-19 Pandemic Response Following the March 2020 passage of the Paycheck Protection Program PPP ), administered by the SBA, the Company participated in assisting its customers with applications for resources through the program. Since the inception of the program, the consolidated PPP originations for the Company through December 31, 2021, including originations by both Legacy Dime and Bridge, exceeded 1.90 billion. Following the completion of the PPP, the Company sold its 2021 PPP loan originations in order to re-deploy funds into ongoing loan portfolio growth. The Company believes that the remainder of its SBA PPP loans will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA in accordance with the terms of the program. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had SBA PPP loans totaling 5.8 million, net of deferred fees. It is the Company s expectation that loans funded through the PPP are fully guaranteed by the U.S. government. We continue to monitor unfunded commitments, including commercial and home equity lines of credit, for evidence of increased credit exposure as borrowers utilize these lines for liquidity purposes.

 It is possible that there will be continued material, adverse impacts to significant estimates, asset valuations, and business operations, including intangible assets, investments, loans, deferred tax assets, and derivative counter party risk, changes in consumer behavior, and supply chain interruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Future government actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including vaccination mandates, may also affect our workforce, human capital resources, and infrastructure. Critical Accounting Estimates Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Company s Audited Consolidated Financial Statement for the year ended December 31, 2022 contains a summary of significant accounting policies. These accounting policies may require various levels of subjectivity, estimates or judgement by management. Policies with respect to the methodologies it uses to determine the allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment and fair value of loans acquired in a business combinations are critical accounting policies because they are important to the presentation of the Company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations. These critical accounting estimates involve a significant degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often necessitate assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. The use of different judgments, assumptions or estimates could result in material variations in the Company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Management has reviewed the following critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with its Audit Committee. Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans Held for Investment Methods and Assumptions Underlying the Estimate On January 1, 2021, we adopted the Current Expected Credit Losses CECL Standard, which requires that loans held for investment be accounted for under the current expected credit losses model. The allowance for credit losses is established and maintained through a provision for credit losses based on expected losses inherent in our loan portfolio. Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis, and additions to the allowance are charged to expense and realized losses, net of recoveries, are charged against the allowance. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In determining the allowance for credit losses for loans that share similar risk characteristics, the Company utilizes a model which compares the amortized cost basis of the loan to the net present value of expected cash flows to be collected. Expected credit losses are determined by aggregating the individual cash flows and calculating a loss percentage by loan segment, or pool, for loans that share similar risk characteristics. For a loan that does not share risk characteristics with other loans, the Company will evaluate the loan on an individual basis. Within the model, assumptions are made in the determination of probability of default, loss given default, reasonable and supportable economic forecasts, prepayment rate, curtailment rate, and recovery lag periods. Management assesses the sensitivity of key assumptions at least annually by stressing the assumptions to understand the impact on the model. Statistical regression is utilized to relate historical macro-economic variables to historical credit loss experience of a peer group of banks that operate in and around Dime s footprint. These models are then utilized to forecast future expected loan losses based on expected future behavior of the same macro-economic variables. Adjustments to the quantitative results are made using qualitative factors. These factors include: (1) lending policies and procedures; (2) international, national, regional and local economic business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various markets; (3) the nature and volume of the loan portfolio; (4) the experience, ability, and depth of the lending management and other relevant staff; (5) the volume and severity of past due loans; (6) the quality of our loan review system; (7) the value of underlying collateral for collateralized loans; (8) the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations; and (9) the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the existing portfolio. For loans that do not share risk characteristics, the Company evaluates these loans on an individual basis based on various factors. Factors that may be considered are borrower delinquency trends and non-accrual status, probability of foreclosure or note sale, changes in the borrower s circumstances or cash collections, borrower s industry, or other facts and circumstances of the loan or collateral. The expected credit loss is measured based on net realizable value, that is, the 
 25 

Table of Contents 
 difference between the discounted value of the expected future cash flows, based on the original effective interest rate, and the amortized cost basis of the loan. For collateral dependent loans, expected credit loss is measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis of the loan and the fair value of the collateral, less estimated costs to sell. Uncertainties Regarding the Estimate Estimating the timing and amounts of future losses is subject to significant management judgment as these projected cash flows rely upon the estimates discussed above and factors that are reflective of current or future expected conditions. These estimates depend on the duration of current overall economic conditions, industry, borrower, or portfolio specific conditions. Volatility in certain credit metrics and differences between expected and actual outcomes are to be expected. Customers may not repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral securing the payment of those loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. Bank regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or loan charge-offs. Impact on Financial Condition and Results of Operations If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover expected losses in the loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance. Future additions or reductions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic, market or other conditions. Changes in estimates could result in a material change in the allowance through charges to earnings would materially decrease our net income. We may experience significant credit losses if borrowers experience financial difficulties, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of the examination process, periodically review the allowance for credit losses. Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of the information available to them at the time of their examination. Fair value of loans acquired in a business combination Methods and Assumptions Underlying the Estimate On February 1, 2021, the Company completed a merger of equals business combination accounted for as a reverse merger using the acquisition method of accounting. As a part of accounting for the Merger, fair value estimates were calculated with a combination of assumptions by management and by using a third party. The fair value often involved third-party estimates utilizing input assumptions by management which may be complex or uncertain. The fair value of acquired loans was based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considers factors such as type of loan and related collateral, and requires management s judgment on estimates about discount rates, expected future cash flows, market conditions and other future events. For purchased financial loans with credit deterioration PCD ), an estimate of expected credit losses was made for loans with similar risk characteristics and was added to the purchase price to establish the initial amortized cost basis of the PCD loans. Any difference between the unpaid principal balance and the amortized cost basis is considered to relate to non-credit factors and resulted in a discount or premium. Discounts and premiums are recognized through interest income on a level-yield method over the life of the loans. For acquired loans not deemed PCD at acquisition, the differences between the initial fair value and the unpaid principal balance are recognized as interest income on a level-yield basis over the lives of the related loans. Uncertainties Regarding the Estimate Management relied on economic forecasts, internal valuations, or other relevant factors which were available at the time of the Merger in the determination of the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the acquired loans. The estimates about discount rates, expected future cash flows, market conditions and other future events were subjective and may differ from estimates.

 Impact on Financial Condition and Results of Operations The estimate of fair values on acquired loans contributed to the recorded goodwill from the Merger. In future income statement periods, interest income on loans will include the amortization and accretion of any premiums and discounts resulting from the fair value of acquired loans. Additionally, the provision for credit losses on acquired individually analyzed PCD loans may be impacted due to changes in the assumptions used to calculate expected cash flows. Comparison of Operating Results Years Ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 The Company s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 include income for the eleven months following the Merger and the results of Legacy Dime for the month ended January 31, 2021. The Company s historical operating results as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, as presented and discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, only include the historical results of Legacy Dime. Accordingly, the Company s historical operating results as of and for periods before February 1, 2021, including the year ended December 31, 2020, as presented and discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, do not include the historical results of Bridge. General. Net income was 152.6 million in 2022, compared to 104.0 million in 2021, and 42.3 million in 2020. During 2022, net interest income increased by 22.3 million, provision for credit losses decreased by 0.8 million, and non-interest expense decreased by 44.6 million. These items were partially offset by a non-interest income decrease of 3.9 million and an income tax expense increase of 15.2 million. During 2021, net interest income increased by 179.9 million, provision for credit losses decreased by 20.0 million, and non-interest income increased by 20.8 million. These items were partially offset by a non-interest expense increase of 127.5 million and an income tax expense increase of 31.5 million. The discussion of net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 should be read in conjunction with the following tables, which set forth certain information related to the consolidated statements of income for those periods, and which also present the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the periods indicated. The average yields and costs were derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of their related assets or liabilities during the periods represented. Average balances were derived from average daily balances. No tax-equivalent adjustments have been made for interest income exempt from Federal, state, and local taxation. The yields include loan fees consisting of amortization of loan origination and commitment fees and certain direct and indirect origination costs, prepayment fees, and late charges that are considered adjustments to yields. Loan fees included in interest income were 3.1 million in 2022, 12.5 million in 2021, and 7.5 million in 2020. There are no out-of-period adjustments included in the rate/volume analysis in the following table.

 (1) Amounts are net of deferred origination costs/ (fees) and allowance for credit losses, and include loans held for sale. Net Interest Income. Net interest income was 379.9 million in 2022, 357.6 million in 2021, and 177.7 million in 2020. Average interest-earning assets were 11.68 billion in 2022, 11.35 billion in 2021 and 6.12 billion in 2020. Net interest margin was 3.25 in 2022, 3.15 in 2021, and 2.90 in 2020. Interest Income. Interest income was 439.2 million in 2022, 384.6 million in 2021, and 234.0 million in 2020. During 2022, interest income increased 54.6 million from 2021, primarily reflecting increases in interest income of 55.7 million on real estate loans, and 6.6 million on securities. The increased interest income on real estate loans was primarily due to growth of 829.5 million in the average balances, and a 28-basis point increase in yield during the period due to the rising interest rate environment. The increased interest income from securities was primarily due to the increase in the average balances of 392.4 million, offset in part by a 2-basis point decrease in the yield. During 2021, interest income increased 150.6 million from 2020, primarily reflecting increases in interest income of 102.5 million on real estate loans, 38.5 million on commercial and industrial C I loans, 8.5 million on securities, and 1.4 million on other loans. The increased interest income on real estate loans was due to an increase of 3.05 billion in the average balance of such loans in the period, offset in part by a 24-basis point decrease in the yield. The increased interest income on C I loans was primarily due to growth of 960.0 million in the average balances, and a 13-basis point increase in yield during the period. The increased interest income from securities was primarily due to the increase in the average balances of 775.2 million, offset in part by a 97-basis point decrease in the yield. The increased average balances in 2021 versus 2020 were related primarily to the Merger transaction. Interest Expense. Interest expense was 59.4 million in 2022, 27.0 million in 2021, and 56.3 million in 2020. During 2022, interest expense increased 32.3 million from 2021, primarily reflecting increases in interest expense of 15.2 million on savings accounts, 5.1 million on FHLBNY advances and 4.4 million on money market accounts. The increase in interest expense on savings accounts was primarily due to increased rates offered on savings accounts and, an increase of 673.1 million in the average balances of such accounts. The increase in interest expense on FHLB advances was primarily due to the increased cost of wholesale borrowings. The increase in interest expense on money market accounts was primarily due to increased rates offered on money market accounts. During 2021, interest expense decreased 29.3 million from 2020, primarily reflecting decreases in interest expense of 15.9 million on FHLBNY advances, and 14.6 million on CDs. The decrease in interest expense on CDs was primarily due to decreased rates offered on CD accounts and, a decrease of 216.2 million in the average balances of such accounts. The decrease in interest expense on FHLBNY advances was primarily due to a decrease of 806.2 million in the average balances of FHLBNY advances, and a decrease of 92 basis points in the cost of such borrowings.

 Provision for Credit Losses. The Company recognized a provision for credit losses of 5.4 million in 2022, 6.2 million in 2021 and 26.2 million in 2020. The 5.4 million provision for credit losses recognized in 2022 was associated with growth in the loan portfolio and a deterioration of forecasted macroeconomic conditions, offset by a reduction in reserves on individually analyzed loans and unfunded commitments. The 6.2 million provision for credit losses recognized in 2021 included a provision recorded on acquired non-PCD loans for the Day 2 accounting of acquired loans from the Merger, offset by improvements in forecasted macroeconomic conditions, and releases of reserves on individually analyzed loans. The 26.2 million provision for credit losses recognized in 2020 resulted mainly from an increase in the general reserve allowance for credit losses due to an adjustment of qualitative factors to account for the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruption, and additional specific reserves on non-performing loans. The provision for credit losses recognized in 2022 and 2021 was calculated in accordance with the CECL Standard adopted by the Company on January 1, 2021. The provision for credit losses recognized in 2020 was calculated in accordance with prior GAAP, in accordance with ASC 310. Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income was 38.2 million in 2022, 42.1 million in 2021, and 21.3 million in 2020. During 2022, non-interest income decreased 3.9 million from 2021, due primarily to a decrease in gains on the sales of SBA PPP loans, and a decrease in gain on sale of residential loans and other non-interest income of 1.3 million each. Offsetting these declines was an increase in BOLI income of 3.3 million and no loss on termination of derivatives in 2022 (versus a 16.5 million loss on termination of derivatives in 2021). During 2021, non-interest income increased 20.8 million from 2020, due primarily to a gain on the sale of SBA PPP loans of 20.7 million, an increase in service charges and other fees of 10.4 million, and an increase in other non-interest income of 3.0 million, partially offset by an increase in loss on termination of derivatives of 9.9 million, a decrease in loan level derivative income of 6.0 million, and a decrease in net gain on sale of securities and other assets of 2.9 million. Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense was 200.7 million in 2022, 245.3 million in 2021, and 117.8 million in 2020. During 2022, non-interest expense decreased 44.6 million from 2021, primarily due to not recognizing any merger expenses and transaction costs and branch restructuring costs in 2022 (versus 44.8 million in merger expenses and transaction costs and 5.1 million of branch restructuring costs in 2021). These declines were offset by an increase of 11.8 million in salaries and employee benefits expenses. During 2021, non-interest expense increased 127.5 million from 2020, reflecting an increase of 47.6 million in salaries and employee benefits expense, an increase of 29.6 million in merger expenses and transaction costs, an increase of 14.5 million in occupancy and equipment expense, an increase of 8.3 million in data processing costs, an increase of 7.2 million in other expenses, and an increase of 5.9 million in professional services expenses, all of which increased primarily due to the Merger. We also incurred branch restructuring costs of 5.1 million during the 2021 period. Non-interest expense was 1.61 , 2.03 , and 1.83 of average assets during 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to merger expenses and transaction costs. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense was 59.4 million in 2022, 44.2 million in 2021, and 12.7 million in 2020. Income tax expense increased 15.2 million during 2022 compared to 2021, primarily as a result of 63.7 million of higher pre-tax income during 2022. Income tax expense increased 31.5 million during 2021 compared to 2020, primarily as a result of 93.2 million of higher pre-tax income during 2021. The Company s consolidated tax rate was 28.0 , 29.8 and 23.0 in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2022 and 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily the result of the loss of benefits from Legacy Dime s REITs as the Company s total assets exceeded 8 billion, and non-deductible expenses during 2021. Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 Assets. Assets totaled 13.19 billion at December 31, 2022, 1.13 billion above their level at December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in the loan portfolio of 1.32 billion, partially offset by a decrease in cash and due from banks of 224.4 million, and a decrease in total securities of 206.6 million. Total net loans held for investment increased 1.32 billion during the year ended December 31, 2022, to 10.48 billion at period end. During the period, the Bank had originations of 2.83 billion.

 Total securities decreased 206.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, to 1.54 billion at period end, primarily due to proceeds from principal payments and calls of 195.3 million and an increase in unrealized losses of 109.7 million, offset in part by purchases of 102.4 million. We transferred 372.2 million of securities available-for-sale to securities held-to-maturity during the year ended December 31, 2022. Liabilities. Total liabilities increased 1.15 billion during the year ended December 31, 2022, to 12.02 billion at period end, primarily due to an increase of 1.11 billion in FHLBNY advances, and an increase of 148.5 million in derivative cash collateral. We maintained a higher level of borrowings to support loan growth and offset a 204.6 million decline in deposits. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not terminate any derivatives. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company terminated 34 derivatives with notional values totaling 785.0 million, resulting in a termination value of 16.5 million which was recognized in loss on termination of derivatives in non-interest income. Stockholders Equity. Stockholders equity decreased 23.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 to 1.17 billion at period end, primarily due to an increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 88.2 million, repurchases of shares of common stock of 46.8 million, common stock dividends of 37.2 million and preferred stock dividends of 7.3 million, offset in part by net income for the period of 152.6 million. Loan Portfolio Composition The following table presents an analysis of outstanding loans by loan type, excluding loans held for sale, net of unearned discounts and premiums and deferred origination fees and costs, at the dates presented:

Loan Purchases, Sales and Servicing In the event that the Bank were to sell loans in the secondary market or through securitization, it generally retains servicing rights on the loans sold. Servicing fees are typically derived based upon the difference between the actual origination rate and contractual pass-through rate of the loans at the time of sale. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank had recorded servicing right assets SRAs of 3.1 million and 3.8 million, respectively, associated with the sale of loans to third-party institutions in which the Bank retained the servicing of the loan. The Bank outsources the servicing of a portion of our one-to-four family mortgage loan portfolio to an unrelated third-party under a sub-servicing agreement. Fees paid under the sub-servicing agreement are reported as a component of other non-interest expense in the consolidated statements of income. Loan Maturity and Repricing As of December 31, 2022, 8.21 billion, or 77.7 of the loan portfolio was scheduled to mature or reprice within five years.

See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of evaluation for impaired securities. Monitoring and Collection of Delinquent Loans Our management reviews delinquent loans on a monthly basis and reports to our Board of Directors at each regularly scheduled Board meeting regarding the status of all non-performing and otherwise delinquent loans in our loan portfolio. Our loan servicing policies and procedures require that an automated late notice be sent to a delinquent borrower as soon as possible after a payment is ten days late in the case of multifamily residential, commercial real estate loans, and C I loans, or fifteen days late in connection with one-to-four family or consumer loans. Thereafter, periodic letters are mailed and phone calls placed to the borrower until payment is received. When contact is made with the borrower at any time prior to foreclosure, we will attempt to obtain the full payment due or negotiate a repayment schedule with the borrower to avoid foreclosure. Accrual of interest is generally discontinued on a loan that meets any of the following three criteria: (i) full payment of principal or interest is not expected; (ii) principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more (unless the loan is both deemed to be well secured and in the process of collection); or (iii) an election has otherwise been made to maintain the loan on a cash basis due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower. Such non-accrual determination practices are applied consistently to all loans regardless of their internal classification or designation. Upon entering non-accrual status, we reverse all outstanding accrued interest receivable. 
 32 

Table of Contents 
 We generally initiate foreclosure proceedings on real estate loans when a loan enters non-accrual status based upon non-payment, unless the borrower is paying in accordance with an agreed upon modified payment agreement. We obtain an updated appraisal upon the commencement of legal action to calculate a potential collateral shortfall and to reserve appropriately for the potential loss. If a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current, paid in full, or refinanced before the foreclosure action is completed, the property securing the loan is transferred to Other Real Estate Owned OREO status. We generally attempt to utilize all available remedies, such as note sales in lieu of foreclosure, in an effort to resolve non-accrual loans and OREO properties as quickly and prudently as possible in consideration of market conditions, the physical condition of the property and any other mitigating circumstances. We have not initiated any expected or imminent foreclosure proceedings that are likely to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. In the event that a non-accrual loan is subsequently brought current, it is returned to accrual status once the doubt concerning collectability has been removed and the borrower has demonstrated performance in accordance with the loan terms and conditions for a period of generally at least six months. The C I portfolio is actively managed by our lenders and underwriters. Most credit facilities typically require an annual review of the exposure and borrowers are required to submit annual financial reporting and loans are structured with financial covenants to indicate expected performance levels. Smaller C I loans are monitored based on performance and the ability to draw against a credit line is curtailed if there are any indications of credit deterioration. Guarantors are also required to update their financial reporting. All exposures are risk rated and those entering adverse ratings due to financial performance concerns of the borrower or material delinquency of any payments or financial reporting are subjected to added management scrutiny. Measures taken typically include amendments to the amount of the available credit facility, requirements for increased collateral, additional guarantor support or a material enhancement to the frequency and quality of financial reporting. Loans determined to reach adverse risk rating standards are monitored closely by Credit Administration to identify any potential credit losses. When warranted, loans reaching a Substandard rating could be reassigned to the Workout Group for direct handling. Non-accrual Loans Within our held-for-investment loan portfolio, non-accrual loans totaled 34.2 million at December 31, 2022 and 40.3 million at December 31, 2021. TDRs We are required to recognize loans for which certain modifications or concessions have been made as TDRs. A TDR has been created in the event that, for economic or legal reasons, any of the following concessions has been granted that would not have otherwise been considered to a debtor experiencing financial difficulties. The following criteria are considered concessions: 
 A reduction of interest rate has been made for the remaining term of the loan The maturity date of the loan has been extended with a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk The outstanding principal amount and/or accrued interest have been reduced 
 In instances in which the interest rate has been reduced, management would not deem the modification a TDR in the event that the reduction in interest rate reflected either a general decline in market interest rates or an effort to maintain a relationship with a borrower who could readily obtain funds from other sources at the current market interest rate, and the terms of the restructured loan are comparable to the terms offered by the Bank to non-troubled debtors. We modified twelve loans in a manner that met the criteria for a TDR during the year ended December 31, 2022. We modified four loans in a manner that met the criteria for a TDR during the year ended December 31, 2021. Accrual status for TDRs is determined separately for each TDR in accordance with our policies for determining accrual or non-accrual status. At the time an agreement is entered into between the Bank and the borrower that results in our determination that a TDR has been created, the loan can be on either accrual or non-accrual status. If a loan is on non-accrual status at the time it is restructured, it continues to be classified as non-accrual until the borrower has demonstrated compliance with the modified loan terms for a period of at least six months. Conversely, if at the time of restructuring the 
 33 

Table of Contents 
 loan is performing (and accruing) it will remain accruing throughout its restructured period, unless the loan subsequently meets any of the criteria for non-accrual status under our policy and agency regulations. Within the allowance for credit losses, losses are estimated for TDRs on accrual status as well as TDRs on non-accrual status that are one-to-four family loans or consumer loans, on a pooled basis with loans that share similar risk characteristics. TDRs on non-accrual status excluding one-to-four family and consumer loans are individually evaluated to determine expected credit losses. For collateral-dependent TDRs where we have determined that foreclosure of the collateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and we expect repayment of the loan to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the allowance for credit losses ACL is measured based on the difference between the fair value of collateral, less the estimated costs to sell, and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. For non-collateral-dependent loans, the ACL is measured based on the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. Please refer to Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of TDRs. OREO Property acquired by the Bank, or a subsidiary, as a result of foreclosure on a mortgage loan or a deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as OREO. Upon entering OREO status, we obtain a current appraisal on the property and reassesses the likely realizable value a/k/a fair value) of the property quarterly thereafter. OREO is carried at the lower of the fair value or book balance, with any write downs recognized through a provision recorded in non-interest expense. Only the appraised value, or either a contractual or formal marketed value that falls below the appraised value, is used when determining the likely realizable value of OREO at each reporting period. We typically seek to dispose of OREO properties in a timely manner. As a result, OREO properties have generally not warranted subsequent independent appraisals. There was no carrying value of OREO properties on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021. We did not recognize any provisions for losses on OREO properties during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020. Past Due Loans Loans Delinquent 30 to 59 Days At December 31, 2022, we had loans totaling 23.5 million that were past due between 30 and 59 days. At December 31, 2021, we had loans totaling 61.2 million that were past due between 30 and 59 days. The 30 to 59-day delinquency levels fluctuate monthly, and are generally considered a less accurate indicator of near-term credit quality trends than non-accrual loans. Loans Delinquent 60 to 89 Days At December 31, 2022, we had loans totaling 0.7 million that were past due between 60 and 89 days. At December 31, 2021, we had loans totaling 12.1 million that were past due between 60 and 89 days. The 60 to 89-day delinquency levels fluctuate monthly, and are generally considered a less accurate indicator of near-term credit quality trends than non-accrual loans. Accruing Loans 90 Days or More Past Due At December 31, 2022, there were no accruing loans 90 days or more past due. At December 31, 2021, we had nine loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of 3.0 million, all of which were 90 days or more past due. These loans were either well secured, awaiting a forbearance extension or formal payment deferral, or will likely be forgiven through the PPP or repurchased by the SBA, and, therefore, remained on accrual status and were deemed performing assets. Reserve for Loan Commitments We maintain a reserve, recorded in other liabilities, associated with unfunded loan commitments accepted by the borrower. The amount of reserve was 2.8 million at December 31, 2022 and 4.4 million at December 31, 2021. This reserve is 
 34 

Table of Contents 
 determined based upon the outstanding volume of loan commitments at each period end. Any increases or reductions in this reserve are recognized in provision for credit losses. Allowance for Credit Losses On January 1, 2021, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13 Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326) . ASU 2016-13 was effective for the Company as of January 1, 2020. Under Section 4014 of the CARES Act, financial institutions required to adopt ASU 2016-13 as of January 1, 2020 were provided an option to delay the adoption of the CECL framework. The Company elected to defer adoption of CECL until January 1, 2021. This standard requires that the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date be based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This standard requires financial institutions and other organizations to use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. The adoption of the CECL Standard resulted in an initial decrease of 3.9 million to the allowance for credit losses and an increase of 1.4 million to the reserve for unfunded commitments. The after-tax cumulative-effect adjustment of 1.7 million was recorded as an increase to retained earnings as of January 1, 2021. A provision of 5.4 million and 6.2 million were recorded during the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The 5.4 million provision for credit losses recognized in 2022 was associated with growth in the loan portfolio and a deterioration of forecased economic conditions, offset by a reduction in reserves on individually analyzed loans and unfunded commitments. The 6.2 million provision for credit losses recognized in 2021 included a provision recorded on acquired non-PCD loans for the Day 2 accounting of acquired loans from the Merger offset by improvements in forecasted macroeconomic conditions, and release of reserves on individually analyzed loans.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Board of Directors of the Bank has approved a liquidity policy that it reviews and updates at least annually. Senior management is responsible for implementing the policy. The Bank s Asset Liability Committee ALCO is responsible for general oversight and strategic implementation of the policy and management of the appropriate departments are designated responsibility for implementing any strategies established by ALCO. On a daily basis, appropriate senior management receives a current cash position report and one-week forecast to ensure that all short-term obligations are timely satisfied and that adequate liquidity exists to fund future activities. Reports detailing the Bank s liquidity reserves are presented to appropriate senior management on a monthly basis, and the Board of Directors at each of its meetings. In addition, a twelve-month liquidity forecast is presented to ALCO in order to assess potential future liquidity concerns. A forecast of cash flow data for the upcoming 12 months is presented to the Board of Directors on an annual basis. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet customer borrowing commitments and deposit withdrawals, either on demand or on contractual maturity, to repay borrowings as they mature, to fund current and planned expenditures and to make new loans and investments as opportunities arise. The Bank s primary sources of funding for its lending and investment activities include deposits, loan and MBS payments, investment security principal and interest payments and advances from the FHLBNY. The Bank may also sell or securitize selected multifamily residential, mixed-use or one-to-four family residential real estate loans to private sector secondary market purchasers, and has in the past sold such loans to FNMA and FHLMC. The Company may additionally issue debt or equity under appropriate circumstances. Although maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investments are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and prepayments on real estate loans and MBS are influenced by interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The Bank is a member of AFX, through which it may either borrow or lend funds on an overnight or short-term basis with other member institutions. The availability of funds changes daily. The Bank utilizes repurchase agreements as part of its borrowing policy to add liquidity. Repurchase agreements represent funds received from customers, generally on an overnight basis, which are collateralized by investment securities. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank s repurchase agreements totaled 1.4 million, included in other short-term borrowings on the consolidated balance sheets. The Bank gathers deposits in direct competition with commercial banks, savings banks and brokerage firms, many among the largest in the nation. It must additionally compete for deposit monies against the stock and bond markets, especially during periods of strong performance in those arenas. The Bank s deposit flows are affected primarily by the pricing and marketing of its deposit products compared to its competitors, as well as the market performance of depositor investment alternatives such as the U.S. bond or equity markets. To the extent that the Bank is responsive to general market increases or declines in interest rates, its deposit flows should not be materially impacted. However, favorable performance of the equity or bond markets could adversely impact the Bank s deposit flows. Total deposits decreased 204.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to an increase of 5.93 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in total deposits during the 2021 period was primarily due to the acquisition of deposits in the Merger. Within deposits, core deposits i.e., non-CDs) decreased 466.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 and increased 6.40 billion during the year ended December 31. 2021. CDs increased 262.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to a decrease of 469.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in CDs during the current period was primarily due to a 294.1 million increase in brokered CDs. The Bank increased its outstanding FHLBNY advances by 1.11 billion during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a 1.18 billion decrease during the year ended December 31, 2021. See Note 13. Federal Home Loan Bank Advances to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Subordinated debentures totaled 200.3 million at December 31, 2022 and 197.1 million at December 31, 2021. See Note 14. Subordinated Debentures to our consolidated financial statements for further information. In the event that the Bank should require funds beyond its ability or desire to generate them internally, an additional source of funds is available through its borrowing line at the FHLBNY or borrowing capacity through AFX and lines of credit

 with unaffiliated correspondent banks. At December 31, 2022, the Bank had an additional unused borrowing capacity of 1.57 billion through the FHLBNY, subject to customary minimum FHLBNY common stock ownership requirements i.e. , 4.5 of the Bank s outstanding FHLBNY borrowings). During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, real estate loan originations totaled 2.67 billion and 1.67 billion, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, C I loan originations totaled 160.1 million and 647.6 million, respectively. Included in the 2021 period was PPP loan originations of 579.9 million.

Proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities totaled 138.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. Purchases of available-for-sale securities totaled 39.2 million and 1.10 billion during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Proceeds from pay downs and calls and maturities of available-for-sale securities were 165.1 million and 411.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Bank did not have proceeds from sales of held-to-maturity securities during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Purchases of held-to-maturity securities totaled 63.2 million and 40.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Proceeds from pay downs and calls and maturities of held-to-maturity securities were 31.7 million and 1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company and the Bank are subject to minimum regulatory capital requirements imposed by its primary federal regulator. As a general matter, these capital requirements are based on the amount and composition of an institution s assets. At December 31, 2022, each of the Company and the Bank were in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital requirements and the Bank was considered well capitalized for all regulatory purposes. The Holding Company repurchased 1,431,241 shares of its common stock during the year ended December 31, 2022. The Holding Company repurchased 1,755,061 shares of its common stock during the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, up to 1,603,760 shares remained available for purchase under the authorized share repurchase programs. See Part II - Item 5. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for additional information about repurchases of common stock. The Holding Company paid 7.3 million in cash dividends on its preferred stock during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Holding Company paid 36.8 million and 39.4 million in cash dividends on its common stock during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Contractual Obligations The Bank generally has outstanding at any time borrowings in the form of FHLBNY advances, short-term or overnight borrowings, subordinated debt, as well as customer CDs with fixed contractual interest rates. In addition, the Bank is obligated to make rental payments under leases on certain of its branches and equipment. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of its loan origination business, the Bank generally has outstanding commitments to extend credit to borrowers, which are originated pursuant to its regular underwriting standards. Available lines of credit may not be drawn on or may expire prior to funding, in whole or in part, and amounts are not estimates of future cash flows. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank had 271.6 million of firm loan commitments that were accepted by the borrowers. Additionally, in connection with a loan securitization transaction that was completed in 2017, the Bank executed a reimbursement agreement with FHLMC that obligates the Company to reimburse FHLMC for any contractual principal and interest payments on defaulted loans, not to exceed 10 of the original principal amount of the loans comprising the aggregate balance of the loan pool at securitization. The maximum exposure under this reimbursement obligation is 28.0 million. The Bank has pledged 28.0 million of pass-through MBS issued by GSEs as collateral.

 Recently Issued Accounting Standards For a discussion of the impact of recently issued accounting standards, please see Note 1 to the Company s consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk General The Company s largest component of market risk remains interest rate risk. The Company is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we conducted zero transactions involving derivative instruments requiring bifurcation in order to hedge interest rate or market risk. Asset/Liability Management Management considers interest rate risk to be the most significant market risk for the Company. Market risk is the risk of losses from adverse changes in market prices and rates. Interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net income as a result of changes in interest rates. The Company s primary earnings source is net interest income, which is affected by changes in the level of interest rates, the relationship between rates, the impact of interest rate fluctuations on asset prepayments, the level and composition of deposits and liabilities, and the credit quality of earning assets. Our asset and liability management objectives are to maintain a strong, stable net interest margin, to utilize its capital effectively without taking undue risks, to maintain adequate liquidity, and to reduce vulnerability of our operations to changes in interest rates. Our Asset and Liability Committee evaluates periodically, but no less than four times annually, the impact of changes in market interest rates on assets and liabilities, net interest margin, capital and liquidity. Risk assessments are governed by policies and limits established by senior management, which are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors at least annually. The economic environment continually presents uncertainties as to future interest rate trends. The Asset and Liability Committee regularly utilizes a model that projects net interest income based on increasing or decreasing interest rates, in order to be better able to respond to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2022, 1.31 billion, or 85.2 , of our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities had fixed interest rates. At December 31, 2022, 7.70 billion, or 72.9 , of our loan portfolio had adjustable or floating interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect the value of interest-earning assets and, in particular, the securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. Increases in interest rates could result in decreases in the market value of interest-earning assets, which could adversely affect stockholders equity and the results of operations if sold. The Company is also subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates. Changes in market interest rates also could affect the type (fixed-rate or adjustable-rate) and amount of loans originated and the average life of loans and securities, which can impact the yields earned on loans and securities. In periods of decreasing interest rates, the average life of loans and securities held may be shortened to the extent increased prepayment activity occurs during such periods which, in turn, may result in the investment of funds from such prepayments in lower yielding assets. Under these circumstances, the Company is subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that management is unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on existing loans and securities. Additionally, increases in interest rates may result in decreasing loan prepayments with respect to fixed rate loans (and, therefore, an increase in the average life of such loans), may result in a decrease in loan demand, and may make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans. In addition, increases in interest rates may result in the extensions of the average life of securities which may result in lower cash flows to the Bank. Interest Rate Risk Exposure Analysis Economic Value of Equity EVE Analysis . In accordance with agency regulatory guidelines, the Company simulates the impact of interest rate volatility upon EVE using several interest rate scenarios. EVE is the difference between the present value of the expected future cash flows of the Company s assets and liabilities and the value of any off-balance sheet items, such as derivatives, if applicable.

 Traditionally, the fair value of fixed-rate instruments fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. Increases in interest rates thus result in decreases in the fair value of interest-earning assets, which could adversely affect the Company s consolidated results of operations in the event they were to be sold, or, in the case of interest-earning assets classified as available-for-sale, reduce the Company s consolidated stockholders equity, if retained. The changes in the value of assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates measure the interest rate sensitivity of those assets and liabilities. In order to measure the Company s sensitivity to changes in interest rates, EVE is calculated under market interest rates prevailing at a given quarter-end Pre-Shock Scenario ), and under various other interest rate scenarios Rate Shock Scenarios representing immediate, permanent, parallel shifts in the term structure of interest rates from the actual term structure observed in the Pre-Shock Scenario. An increase in the EVE is considered favorable, while a decline is considered unfavorable. The changes in EVE between the Pre-Shock Scenario and various Rate Shock Scenarios due to fluctuations in interest rates reflect the interest rate sensitivity of the Company s assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet items that are included in the EVE. Management reports the EVE results to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. The report compares the Company s estimated Pre-Shock Scenario EVE to the estimated EVE calculated under the various Rate Shock Scenarios. The Company s valuation model makes various estimates regarding cash flows from principal repayments on loans and deposit decay rates at each level of interest rate change. The Company s estimates for loan repayment levels are influenced by the recent history of prepayment activity in its loan portfolio, as well as the interest rate composition of the existing portfolio, especially in relation to the existing interest rate environment. In addition, the Company considers the amount of fee protection inherent in the loan portfolio when estimating future repayment cash flows. Regarding deposit decay rates, the Company tracks and analyzes the decay rate of its deposits over time, with the assistance of a reputable third-party, and over various interest rate scenarios. Such results are utilized in determining estimates of deposit decay rates in the valuation model. The Company also generates a series of spot discount rates that are integral to the valuation of the projected monthly cash flows of its assets and liabilities. The valuation model employs discount rates that it considers representative of prevailing market rates of interest with appropriate adjustments it believes are suited to the heterogeneous characteristics of the Company s various asset and liability portfolios. No matter the care and precision with which the estimates are derived, actual cash flows could differ significantly from the Company s estimates resulting in significantly different EVE calculations. The analysis that follows presents, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the estimated EVE at both the Pre-Shock Scenario and the +100 Basis Point Rate and +200 Basis Point Rate Shock Scenarios. 

December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Dollar Percentage Dollar Percentage (Dollars in thousands) EVE Change Change EVE Change Change Rate Shock Scenarios + 200 Basis Points 1,717,562 78,373 4.8 1,413,179 194,959 16.0 + 100 Basis Points 1,703,131 63,942 3.9 1,334,981 116,761 9.6 Pre-Shock Scenario 1,639,189 1,218,220 The Company s Pre-Shock Scenario EVE increased from 1.22 billion at December 31, 2021 to 1.64 billion at December 31, 2022. The primary factor contributing to the increase in EVE at December 31, 2022, was the increase in value of the Bank s low-cost deposit base relative to the current rate environment. Throughout 2022, market interest rates utilized in the calculation of economic value increased materially across all yield curve points. However, the Bank continued to maintain a relatively low-cost funding base during this time even as market rates have risen measurably, resulting in additional economic value. The Company s EVE in the +100 Basis Point Rate and +200 Basis Point Rate Shock Scenarios increased from 1.33 billion and 1.41 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2021, to 1.70 billion and 1.72 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2022.

 Income Simulation Analysis . As of the end of each quarterly period, the Company also monitors the impact of interest rate changes through a net interest income simulation model. This model estimates the impact of interest rate changes on the Company s net interest income over forward-looking periods typically not exceeding 36 months (a considerably shorter period than measured through the EVE analysis). Management reports the net interest income simulation results to the Company s Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. The following table discloses the estimated changes to the Company s net interest income in various time periods assuming gradual changes in interest rates over a 12-month period beginning December 31, 2022, for the given rate scenarios:

The audited consolidated financial statements presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include the collective results of the Holding Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank, which are collectively herein referred to as we , us , our and the Company. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse merger using the acquisition method of accounting, which means that for accounting and financial reporting purposes, Legacy Dime was deemed to have acquired Bridge in the Merger, even though Bridge was the legal acquirer.

The Company s results of operations for 2021 include the results of operations of Bridge on and after the Merger Date. Results for periods before the Merger Date reflect only those of Legacy Dime and do not include the results of operations of Bridge. The number of shares issued and outstanding, earnings per share, additional paid-in capital, dividends paid and all references to share quantities of the Company have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the equivalent number of shares issued to holders of Legacy Dime common stock in the Merger. The assets and liabilities of Bridge as of the Merger Date were recorded at their estimated fair values and added to those of Legacy Dime. See Note 2. Merger for further information. As of December 31, 2022, we operated branch locations throughout Long Island and New York City boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan and the Bronx. The Company is a bank holding company engaged in commercial banking and financial services through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dime Community Bank.

 billion and million at December 31, 2022, respectively. Individually evaluated loans Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis based on various factors, and are not included in the collective pool evaluation. Factors that may be considered are borrower delinquency trends and non-accrual status, probability of foreclosure or note sale, changes in the borrower s circumstances or cash collections, borrower s industry, or other facts and circumstances of the loan or collateral. For a loan that does not share risk characteristics with other loans, expected credit loss is measured based on net realizable value, that is, the difference between the discounted value of the expected future cash flows, based on the original effective interest rate, and the amortized cost basis of the loan. For these loans, the Company recognizes expected credit loss equal to the amount by which the net realizable value of the loan is less than the amortized cost basis of the loan (which is net of previous charge-offs), except when the loan is collateral dependent, that is, when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. In these cases, expected credit loss is measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis of the loan and the fair value of the collateral. The fair value of the collateral is adjusted for the estimated costs to sell the collateral if repayment or satisfaction of a loan is dependent on the sale (rather than only on the operation) of the collateral.

 million and million at December 31, 2022, respectively. The fair value of real estate collateral is determined based on recent appraised values. Appraisals are performed by certified general appraisers (for commercial properties) or certified residential appraisers (for residential properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by the Company. Appraisals undergo a second review process to ensure that the methodology employed and the values derived are reasonable. Generally, collateral values for real estate loans for which measurement of expected losses is dependent on collateral values are updated every twelve months. Non-real estate collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation and management s expertise and knowledge of the borrower and its business. Once the expected credit loss amount is determined, an allowance is provided for equal to the calculated expected credit loss and included in the allowance for credit losses. Pursuant to the Company s policy, credit losses must be charged-off in the period the loans, or portions thereof, are deemed uncollectable. Allowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures, which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition, is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life, which is the same as the expected loss factor as determined based on the corresponding portfolio segment. For further discussion of our loan accounting and acquisitions, see Note 2 Merger and Note 5 Loans.

 reportable segment, Community Banking. All of the Company s activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent and assessed based on the manner in which it supports the other activities of the Company. For example, lending is dependent upon the ability of the Bank to fund itself with retail deposits and other borrowings and to manage interest rate and credit risk. Accordingly, all significant operating decisions are based upon analysis of the Company as operating segment or unit. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, there was no customer that accounted for more than 10 of the Company s consolidated revenue. million to the allowance for credit losses and an increase of million to the reserve for unfunded commitments in other liabilities. The after-tax cumulative-effect adjustment of million was recorded in retained earnings as of January 1, 2021. There were no held-to-maturity securities as of January 1, 2021 and, therefore, no impact from the adoption of the CECL Standard. Standards That Have Not Yet Been Adopted ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to loan and lease agreements, derivative contracts, and other transactions affected by the anticipated transition away from LIBOR toward new interest rate benchmarks. ASU 2020-04 also provides numerous optional expedients for derivative accounting. ASU 2020-04 is effective March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. Once optional expedients are elected, the amendments in this ASU must be applied prospectively for all eligible contract modifications for that Topic or Industry Subtopic within the Codification. We are evaluating the impact of ASU 2020-04 and expect the LIBOR transition will not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope ASU 2021-01 clarifies that all derivative instruments affected by changes to the interest rates used for discounting, margining, or contract price alignment due to reference rate reform are in the scope of ASC 848. Entities may apply certain optional expedients in ASC 848 to derivative instruments that do not reference LIBOR or another rate expected to be discontinued as a result of reference rate reform if there is a change to the interest rate used for discounting, margining or contract price alignment. ASU 2020-01 is effective upon issuance and generally can be applied through December 31, 2022. The adoption of ASU 2021-01 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of Legacy Dime s Series A preferred stock, par value was converted into share of a newly created series of the Company s preferred stock having the same powers, preferences and rights as the Dime Preferred Stock. In connection with the Merger, the Company assumed million in aggregate principal amount of the Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Debentures due 2027 of Legacy Dime. The Merger constituted a business combination and was accounted for as a reverse merger using the acquisition method of accounting. As a result, Legacy Dime was the accounting acquirer and Bridge was the legal acquirer and the accounting acquiree. Accordingly, the historical financial statements of Legacy Dime became the historical financial statements of the combined company. In addition, the assets and liabilities of Bridge have been recorded at their estimated fair values and added to those of Legacy Dime as of the Merger Date. The determination of fair value required management to make estimates about discount rates, expected future cash flows, market conditions and other future events that are subjective and subject to change. The Company issued million shares of its common stock to Legacy Dime stockholders in connection with the Merger, which represented of the voting interests in the Company upon completion of the Merger. In accordance with FASB ASC 805-40-30-2, the purchase price in a reverse acquisition is determined based on the number of equity interests the legal acquiree would have had to issue to give the owners of the legal acquirer the same percentage equity interest in the combined entity that results from the reverse acquisition. The table below summarizes the ownership of the combined company following the Merger, for each shareholder group, as well as the market capitalization of the combined company using shares of Bridge and Legacy Dime common stock outstanding at January 31, 2021 and Bridge s closing price on January 31, 2021.

Table of Contents 
 Treasury securities Corporate securities Pass-through MBS issued by GSEs Agency CMOs State and municipal obligations As of December 31, 2022, of the Company s available-for-sale debt securities were in an unrealized loss position due to credit and therefore allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities was required. Additionally, given the high-quality composition of the Company s held-to-maturity portfolio, the Company did not record an allowance for credit losses on the held-to-maturity portfolio. With respect to certain classes of debt securities, primarily U.S. Treasuries and securities issued by Government Sponsored Entities, the Company considers the history of credit losses, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, which may indicate that the expectation that nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is or continues to be zero, even if the U.S. government were to technically default. Accrued interest receivable on securities totaling million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively, was included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet and excluded from the amortized cost and estimated fair value totals in the table above. Management evaluates available-for-sale debt securities in unrealized loss positions to determine whether the impairment is due to credit-related factors or noncredit-related factors. Consideration is given to (1) the extent to which the fair value is less than amortized cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and (3) the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. At December 31, 2022, substantially all of the securities in an unrealized loss position had a fixed interest rate and the cause of the temporary impairment was directly related to changes in interest rates. The Company generally views changes in fair value caused by changes in interest rates as temporary, which is consistent with its experience. The following major security types held by the Company are all issued by U.S. government entities and agencies and therefore either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government: Agency Notes, Treasury Securities, Pass-through MBS issued by GSEs, Agency Collateralized Mortgage Obligations. Substantially all of the corporate bonds within the portfolio have maintained an investment grade rating by either Kroll, Egan-Jones, Fitch, Moody s or Standard and Poor s. None of the unrealized losses are related to credit losses. Substantially all of the state and municipal obligations within the portfolio have all maintained an investment grade rating by either Moody s or Standard and Poor s. The Company does not have the intent to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery. The issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments on the debt. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach maturity.

Credit Quality Indicators The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit structure, loan documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying them as to credit risk. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: Special Mention. Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the Bank s credit position at some future date. Substandard. Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful. Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of then existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.

Freestanding Derivatives The Company maintains an interest-rate risk protection program for its loan portfolio in order to offer loan level derivatives with certain borrowers and to generate loan level derivative income. The Company enters into interest rate swap or interest rate floor agreements with borrowers. These interest rate derivatives are designed such that the borrower synthetically attains a fixed-rate loan, while the Company receives floating rate loan payments. The Company offsets the loan level interest rate swap exposure by entering into an offsetting interest rate swap or interest rate floor with an unaffiliated and reputable bank counterparty. These interest rate derivatives do not qualify as designated hedges, under ASC 815; therefore, each interest rate derivative is accounted for as a freestanding derivative. The notional amounts of the interest rate derivatives do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties. The amount exchanged is determined by reference to the notional amount and the other terms of the individual interest rate derivative agreements. The following tables reflect freestanding derivatives included in the consolidated statements of financial condition as of the dates indicated: Loan level interest rate swaps with borrower Loan level interest rate floors with borrower Loan level interest rate swaps with third-party counterparties Loan level interest rate swaps with third-party counterparties Loan level interest rate floors with third-party counterparties

The Company is subject to regular examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which it conducts significant business operations. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional examinations in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from ongoing assessments. Under current accounting rules, all tax positions adopted are subjected to two levels of evaluation. Initially, a determination is made, based on the technical merits of the position, as to whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. In conducting this evaluation, management is required to presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority possessing full knowledge of all relevant information. The second level of evaluation is the measurement of a tax position that satisfies the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold. This measurement is performed in order to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.

Effective July 1, 1996, the Company established the Outside Director Retirement Plan to provide benefits to each eligible outside director commencing upon the earlier of termination of Board service or at age 75 . The Outside Director Retirement Plan was frozen on March 31, 2005, and only outside directors serving prior to that date are eligible for benefits. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bank used December 31 as its measurement date for both the BMP and Outside Director Retirement Plan. In connection with the Merger, the Outside Director Retirement Plan and the BMP were terminated, resulting in lump sum payments to the participants in the amounts of million for the Outside Director Retirement Plan and million for the BMP. The total expense recognized as a curtailment loss during the three months ended March 31, 2021 was million. The combined funded status of the defined benefit portions of the BMP and the Director Retirement Plan was as follows: Interest cost Benefit payments ) ) Actuarial (gain) loss ) Projected benefit obligation at end of year Plan assets at fair value: Balance at beginning of year Contributions Benefit payments ) ) Balance at end of period Funded status at end of year ) The combined net periodic cost for the defined benefit portions of the BMP and the Director Retirement Plan included the following components: Curtailment loss Amortization of unrealized loss Net periodic benefit cost

Postretirement Benefit Plan benefits were available only to full-time employees who commence or commenced collecting retirement benefits from the Retirement Plan immediately upon termination of service from the Bank. The Postretirement Benefit Plan was amended effective March 31, 2015 to eliminate plan participation for post-amendment retirees. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Legacy Dime approved the termination of the Postretirement Benefit Plan in anticipation of the Merger. As a result of the decision to terminate the plan, no additional benefits will be paid after January 31, 2021, and a curtailment gain of million was recognized through net periodic cost during the year ended December 31, 2020.

 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank had outstanding firm loan commitments that were accepted by borrowers that aggregated to million and million, respectively. Substantially all of the Bank s commitments expire within of their acceptance by the prospective borrowers. The credit risk associated with these commitments is based on the loan type which is comprised of multifamily residential, residential mixed-use, commercial real estate, commercial mixed-use, C I, and one-to-four family residential loans. At December 31, 2022, the Bank had an available line of credit with the FHLBNY equal to its excess borrowing capacity. At December 31, 2022, this amount approximated billion. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Bank completed a securitization of million of its multifamily loans through a Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation FHLMC sponsored Q-deal securitization completed in December 2017. With respect to the securitization transaction, the Company also has continuing involvement through a reimbursement agreement executed with Freddie Mac. To the extent the ultimate resolution of defaulted loans results in contractual principal and interest payments that are deficient, the Company is obligated to reimburse FHLMC for such amounts, not to exceed of the original principal amount of the loans comprising the securitization pool at the closing date. Litigation The Company is subject to certain pending and threatened legal actions which arise out of the normal course of business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, particularly in proceedings where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, or which are in their early stages. The Company cannot predict with certainty the actual loss or range of loss related to such legal proceedings, the manner in which they will be resolved, the timing of final resolution or the ultimate settlement. Consequently, the Company cannot estimate losses or ranges of losses related to such legal matters, even in instances where it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred. In the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, the resolution of all ongoing legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the Company. The Company accounts for potential losses related to litigation in accordance with GAAP.

 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, the Company s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by the annual report. Report by Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting. The Company s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error and circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting based on those criteria. The Company s independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements that are included in this annual report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting. The attestation report of Crowe LLP appears on page 104. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Dime Community Bancshares, Inc. and Subsidiaries Hauppauge, New York Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Dime Community Bancshares, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report by Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Allowance for Credit Losses for Loans Qualitative Factors As described in Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements, the Company estimates expected credit losses for its financial assets carried at amortized cost utilizing the current expected credit loss CECL methodology. At December 31, 2022, the allowance for credit losses (the ACL on the overall loan portfolio was 83.5 million. In determining the ACL related to loans that are collectively evaluated, expected credit losses are determined by calculating a loss percentage by loan segment, or pool. Management estimates the allowance for credit losses on each loan pool using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historically observed credit loss experience of peer banks within the Company s geography, adjusted for prepayment and curtailment assumptions as well as macro-economic variables, provide the basis for the estimation of quantitatively modeled expected credit losses on similar loan pools. The quantitative results of the modeling are then adjusted using qualitative factors. These factors include: (1) lending policies and procedures; (2) international, national, regional and local economic business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various markets; (3) the nature and volume of the loan portfolio; (4) the experience, ability, and depth of the lending management and other relevant staff; (5) the volume and severity of past due loans; (6) the quality of our loan review system; (7) the value of underlying collateral for collateralized loans; (8) the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations; and (9) the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the existing portfolio. A significant amount of judgment is required to assess the reasonableness of the qualitative factors. Further, changes to these factors could have a material effect on the Company s financial results. The qualitative factors contribute significantly to the determination of the ACL related to loans that share similar risk characteristics. We identified the assessment of qualitative factors as a critical audit matter because auditing management s estimate required especially subjective auditor judgment. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included testing the effectiveness of controls over the evaluation of the qualitative factors and substantively testing management s process related to the assessment of qualitative factors. The testing of the effectiveness of controls over the evaluation of qualitative factors involved controls addressing management s review and approval of the qualitative factors, including significant assumptions and judgments made and the relevance and reliability of data used as the basis for those judgments. The substantive testing of management s process related to the assessment of qualitative factors, including evaluating management s judgments and significant assumptions used in the assessment of qualitative factors, involved evaluation of the reasonableness of management s judgments related to qualitative factors to determine if they are calculated to conform with management s policies. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Exhibit 4.1 to Form 10-K - WITH PREFERRED STOCK (2022) (00379822.DOCX;1) 
 
 Exhibit 4.1 Description of Dime Community Bancshares, Inc. Securities Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this prospectus to Dime Community Bancshares, the Company, we, us, our or similar references mean Dime Community Bancshares, Inc. Description of Common Stock We are authorized to issue 90,000,000 shares of capital stock, 80,000,000 of which are shares of common stock, par value of 0.01 per share, and 10,000,000 of which are shares of preferred stock, par value of 0.01 per share. Each share of common stock has the same relative rights as, and is identical in all respects to, each other share of common stock. All of our shares of common stock are duly authorized, fully paid and nonassessable. Dividends The holders of our common stock are entitled to receive and share equally in such dividends, if any, declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor. Under the New York Business Corporation Law, we may pay dividends on our outstanding shares except when the Company is insolvent or would be made insolvent by the dividend. In addition, we may pay dividends and other distributions either (1) out of surplus, so that our net assets remaining after such payment or distribution shall at least equal the amount of our stated capital, or (2) if we have no such surplus, out of our net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year; provided, that, if our capital is less than the aggregate amount of the stated capital represented by the issued and outstanding shares of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets, we may not pay dividends out of such net profits until the deficiency in the amount of stated capital represented by the issued and outstanding shares of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets shall have been repaired. Under the terms of the Company s 5.50 Fixed-Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, unless full dividends for the most recently completed preferred stock dividend period on all outstanding shares of preferred stock have been declared and paid in full or declared or a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside, dividends may not be paid to the holders of our common stock (except for stock dividends and a dividend in connection with a stockholders rights plan ). Voting Rights The holders of our common stock are generally entitled to one vote per share. Board of Directors Our bylaws provide that the Board of Directors must consist of not less than five nor more than 25 directors, the exact number to be determined by resolution of a majority of the full Board of Directors. The members of the Board of Directors are elected on an annual basis. Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by shareholders present at the annual shareholders meeting, or if the annual meeting is not held, at a special meeting called for the purpose of the election of directors. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to cumulate their votes in the election of directors. Liquidation In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of our common stock would be entitled to receive, after payment or provision for payment of all our debts and liabilities and the holders of any preferred stock, all of our assets available for distribution. 
 {Clients/1057/00379822.DOCX/ } 

No Preemptive or Redemption Rights Holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights with respect to any shares that may be issued. The common stock is not subject to redemption. Certain Provisions in Our Certificate of Incorporation, Our Bylaws, and Applicable Laws and Regulations Our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and applicable federal and New York laws and regulations contain a number of provisions relating to corporate governance and rights of shareholders that might have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company. Such provisions are listed below. Provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws Prohibition of Cumulative Voting. Our shareholders are not entitled to cumulative voting in the election of directors. Restrictions on Call of Special Meetings . Our bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders can be called by the Board of Directors . Amendments to Certificate of Incorporation. Our certificate of incorporation provides that certain provisions may only be amended by the approval of 75 of the shares entitled to vote on such amendment, unless such amendment has been approved by an affirmative vote of 75 of directors then in office. Business Combinations Involving Interested Shareholders . Our certificate of incorporation provides that an interested shareholder (a person who owns or an affiliate or associate of the Company who has owned in the previous two-year period more than 5 of the Company s common stock) may engage in a business combination with the Company (i) if approved by the affirmative vote of not less than 75 of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders or (ii) (a) if approved by 75 or more of the continuing directors and (b) the per share value of the consideration for the transaction is equal to the higher of the highest per share price paid by the interested shareholder in acquiring Company common stock in the preceding two years and the fair market value per share of common stock on the date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder. Evaluation of Offers . Our certificate of incorporation provide s that the Board of Directors may, in the context of opposing a tender offer, take into account (i) the social and economic effects of the offer or transaction on the employees, depositors, loan and other customers, creditors, shareholders and other elements of the communities in which we operate or are located, (ii) the reputation and business practices of the offeror and its management and affiliates, and (iii) the business and financial condition and earnings prospects of the offer or, including the possible effect of such conditions on the other elements of the communities in which we operate or are located. Federal Laws and Regulations The Bank Holding Company Act generally would prohibit any company that is not engaged in financial activities and activities that are permissible for a bank holding company or a financial holding company from acquiring control of us. Control is generally defined as ownership of 25 or more of the voting stock or other exercise of a controlling influence. In addition, any existing bank holding company would need the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before acquiring 5 or more of our voting stock. The Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring control of a bank holding company unless the Federal Reserve has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve, the acquisition of 10 or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, such as us, could constitute acquisition of control of the bank holding company. New York Business Corporation Law The business combination provisions of the New York Business Corporation Law could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeovers or change in control attempts with respect to the Company and, accordingly, may 
 {Clients/1057/00379822.DOCX/ } 

discourage attempts to acquire the Company. In general such provisions prohibit an interested shareholder (i.e., a person who owns 20 or more of our outstanding voting stock) from engaging in various business combination transactions with our company, unless (a) the business combination transaction, or the transaction in which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder, was approved by the Board of Directors prior to the interested shareholder s stock acquisition date, (b) the business combination transaction was approved by the disinterested shareholders at a meeting called no earlier than five years after the interested shareholder s stock acquisition date, or (c) if the business combination transaction takes place no earlier than five years after the interested stockholder s stock acquisition date, the price paid to all the stockholders under such transaction meets statutory criteria. Description of Series A Preferred Stock Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors, without further stockholder action, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.01 per share, in series, and to fix the designation, powers, preferences, and rights of the shares of such series and any qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereof, without further vote or action by the Company s stockholders. The number of authorized shares of preferred stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock, without a vote of the holders of the preferred stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to the terms of any preferred stock designation. The Company has issued shares of its 5.50 Fixed-Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, par value 0.01 per share, with a liquidation preference of 25.00 per share (which we refer to below as the preferred stock ). Dividends Holders of the preferred stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, out of assets legally available for payment of dividends under New York law, non-cumulative cash dividends based on the liquidation preference of the preferred stock at a rate equal to 5.50 per annum for each Dividend Period, which is the period from and including a dividend payment date to but excluding the next dividend payment date. Dividends payable on the preferred stock will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dollar amounts resulting from that calculation will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward. If declared by the Board of Directors, the Company will pay dividends on the preferred stock quarterly, in arrears, on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, or the next business day thereafter. No dividends on the preferred stock will be declared, paid or set aside to the extent such act would cause us to fail to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, including applicable capital adequacy rules of any appropriate federal banking regulator or agency. Dividends on the preferred stock are not cumulative. If the Board of Directors does not declare a dividend on the preferred stock in respect of a Dividend Period, then no dividend will be deemed to have accrued for such Dividend Period, be payable on the applicable dividend payment date, or be cumulative, and the Company will have no obligation to pay any dividend for that Dividend Period, whether or not the Board of Directors declares a dividend on the preferred stock for any future Dividend Period. So long as any shares of preferred stock are outstanding, unless, in each case, the full dividends for the most recently completed Dividend Period on all outstanding shares of preferred stock have been declared and paid in full or declared or a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside: 1. no dividend shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment on any Junior Stock (as defined below) (other than (i) a dividend payable solely in Junior Stock, or (ii) any dividend in connection with the implementation of a stockholders rights plan, or the redemption or repurchase of any rights under any such plan), 2. no shares of Junior Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by us, directly or indirectly (other than (i) as a result of a reclassification of Junior Stock for or into other 
 {Clients/1057/00379822.DOCX/ } 

Junior Stock, (ii) the exchange or conversion of one share of Junior Stock for or into another share of Junior Stock, (iii) through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Junior Stock, (iv) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Junior Stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants, (v) purchases of shares of Junior Stock pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy Junior Stock existing prior to the preceding Dividend Period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan, or (vi) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Junior Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such stock or the security being converted or exchanged) nor shall any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such securities by the Company; and 3. no shares of Parity Stock (as defined below) shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by us, directly or indirectly (other than (i) pursuant to offers to purchase all or a pro rata portion of the preferred stock and such Parity Stock, (ii) as a result of a reclassification of Parity Stock for or into other Parity Stock, (iii) the exchange or conversion of one share of Parity Stock for or into another share of Parity Stock or Junior Stock, (iv) through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Parity Stock, (v) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Parity Stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants, (vi) purchases of shares of Parity Stock pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy Parity Stock existing prior to the preceding Dividend Period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan, or (vii) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Parity Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such stock or the security being converted or exchanged) nor shall any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such securities by the Company. When dividends are not paid in full upon the shares of the preferred stock and any Parity Stock, if any, all dividends declared upon shares of the preferred stock and any Parity Stock, if any, will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current per share on the preferred stock, and accrued dividends, including any accumulations, on any Parity Stock, bear to each other. No interest shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment on the preferred stock that may be in arrears. As used in this description of the preferred stock, Junior Stock means the Company s common stock and any other class or series of stock hereafter authorized over which the preferred stock has preference or priority in the payment of dividends and/or in the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. Parity Stock means any other class or series of Company stock that ranks equally with the preferred stock in the payment of dividends and/or in the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. Senior Stock means any other class or series of Company stock ranking senior to the preferred stock with respect to payment of dividends and/or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. Subject to the considerations described above, dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) may be declared and paid on the Company s common stock and any other stock ranking equally with or junior to the preferred stock, from time to time out of any assets legally available for such payment, and the holders of the preferred stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend. Preemptive Rights The holders of the preferred stock do not have any preemptive rights with respect to any shares of the Company s capital stock or any of its other securities convertible into or carrying rights or options to purchase any such capital stock. Conversion Rights 
 {Clients/1057/00379822.DOCX/ } 

The preferred stock is not convertible into or exchangeable for any other of the Company s property, interests or any other class or series of securities. Redemption The preferred stock is not subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provisions. The Company may redeem the preferred stock at our option, in whole or in part, from time to time, on or after June 15, 2025, subject to approval of the appropriate federal banking agency, at a redemption price equal to 25 per share, plus declared and unpaid dividends for prior Dividend Periods and any accrued but unpaid (whether or not declared) dividends for the then current Dividend Period to, but excluding, the redemption date. The holders of preferred stock do not have the right to require the redemption or repurchase of the preferred stock. The Company may also redeem shares of the preferred stock at any time within 90 days following a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event (as defined below), in whole but not part, subject to the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency, at a redemption price equal to 25 per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends for prior Dividend Periods and any accrued but unpaid (whether or not declared) dividends for the then-current Dividend Period to but excluding the redemption date. A Regulatory Capital Treatment Event means the Company s good faith determination that, as a result of (i) any amendment to, or change in (including any announced prospective change), the laws or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision of or in the United States that is enacted or becomes effective after the initial issuance of the preferred stock; (ii) any proposed change in those laws or regulations that is announced after the initial issuance of the preferred stock; or (iii) final official administrative decision or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying those laws or regulations that is made, adopted, approved, announced or becomes effective after the initial issuance of the preferred stock, there is more than an insubstantial risk that the Company will not be entitled to treat the full liquidation value of the shares of preferred stock then outstanding as additional tier 1 capital (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines of Federal Reserve Regulation Y (or, as and if applicable, the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency), as then in effect and applicable, for as long as any preferred stock is outstanding. Our certificate of incorporation set forth the procedures for redemption. Subject to the provisions therein, the Board of Directors may prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of preferred stock are redeemed from time to time. Any redemption of the preferred stock is subject to receipt of any required prior approval of the Federal Reserve and to the satisfaction of any conditions set forth in the capital guidelines or regulations of the Federal Reserve applicable to redemption of the preferred stock. Liquidation Rights In the event of our liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, the holders of the preferred stock would be entitled to receive a liquidating distribution of 25 per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors and subject to the rights of holders of any securities ranking senior to the preferred stock but before the Company makes any distribution of assets to the holders of the Company s common stock or any other class or series of shares ranking junior to the preferred stock. If the Company s assets are not sufficient to pay the liquidation preferences plus declared and unpaid dividends in full to all holders of the preferred stock and all holders of Parity Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of preferred stock and any Parity Stock will be paid pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidating distribution owed to those holders. Holders of the preferred stock will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Company after they have received their full liquidating distribution (including declared and unpaid dividends). Claims of holders of the preferred stock would be subordinate to all of the Company s indebtedness, including any subordinated debt securities, and to other non-equity claims on the Company and its assets, including any interests held by the United States government. 
 {Clients/1057/00379822.DOCX/ } 

The merger or consolidation of the Company with any other entity or by another entity with or into the Company will not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. If the Company enters into any merger or consolidation transaction with or into any other entity and the Company is not the surviving entity in such transaction, the preferred stock may be converted into shares of the surviving or successor corporation, or its parent company, with terms that are substantially similar to the terms of the Company s preferred stock. Voting Rights Except as provided below, the holders of the preferred stock have no voting rights. Right to Elect Two Directors Upon Nonpayment . If the Company fails to pay, or declare and set apart for payment, dividends on outstanding shares of the preferred stock or any other series of our preferred stock for six quarterly Dividend Periods, whether or not consecutive, the holders of shares of the preferred stock will have the right, voting as a class with holders of any other voting Parity Stock, to vote for the election of two additional members of the board of directors of the Company to hold office for a term of one year (the Preferred Directors at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20 of the aggregate voting power of the preferred stock or any other series of Parity Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the Company s next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, or if no such request is made, in either event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of the stockholders). Upon payment, or declaration and setting apart for payment, in full, the terms of the two Preferred Directors will terminate, and the number of the Company s directors will be reduced by two, and the voting right of the holders of the preferred stock (and holders of any other equally ranked series of our preferred stock that have similar voting rights) will cease, subject to increase in the number of directors as described above and to revesting of such voting right in the event of each and every additional failure in the payment of dividends for six quarterly Dividend Periods, or their equivalent, whether or not consecutive, as described above. Any Preferred Director may be removed and replaced at any time, with cause as provided by law or without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of the preferred stock voting together as a class with the holders of voting Parity Stock, to the extent the voting rights of such holders described above are then exercisable. Any vacancy created by removal with or without cause may be filled only as described in the preceding sentence. If the office of any Preferred Director becomes vacant for any reason other than removal, the remaining Preferred Director may choose a successor who will hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. In addition, if and when the rights of holders of the preferred stock terminate for any reason, including under circumstances described above under Redemption, such voting rights will terminate along with the other rights (except, if applicable, the right to receive the redemption price plus any declared and unpaid dividends), and the terms of any Preferred Directors will terminate automatically and the number of directors will be reduced by two, assuming that the rights of holders of voting Parity Stock have similarly terminated. Under regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve, if the holders of any series of preferred stock are or become entitled to vote for the election of directors, such series will be deemed a class of voting securities. A company holding 25 or more of the series, or 10 or more if it otherwise exercises a controlling influence over the Company, will be subject to regulation as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act. In addition, at the time the series is deemed a class of voting securities, any other bank holding company will be required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act to acquire or retain more than 5 of that series. Any other person (other than a bank holding company) will be required to obtain the non-objection of the Federal Reserve under the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, to acquire or retain 10 or more of that series. Other Voting Rights . So long as any shares of preferred stock remain outstanding, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of all outstanding shares of the
