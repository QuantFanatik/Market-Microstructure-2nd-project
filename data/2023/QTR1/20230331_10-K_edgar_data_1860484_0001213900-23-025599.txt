PART
I 

Item
1. Business. 

Overview 

We
are a blank check company formed as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting our initial business combination. 

While
we have focused on targets in the legalized cannabis industry, we have also actively explored business combination targets in other businesses,
industries or geographical locations, including, but not limited to, related industries such as consumer packaged goods, health 
wellness, technology, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, distribution, logistics and brand management. On February 13, 2023, we entered
into the Business Combination Agreement, as more fully disclosed under SVES Business Combination below. 

Initial
Public Offering 

On
February 15, 2022, we consummated our initial public offering of 14,375,000 units. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common
stock and one redeemable warrant of the Company, with each warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common
stock for 11.50 per whole share. The units were sold at a price of 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of 143,750,000. 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 653,750 private placement units to
our sponsor at a purchase price of 10.00 per private placement unit, generating gross proceeds of 6,537,500. 

A
total of 146,625,000, including 143,750,000 of the proceeds from the initial public offering and 2,875,000 of the proceeds of the
sale of the private placement units, was placed in the trust account maintained by Continental, acting as trustee, at the consummation
of the initial public offering. 

It
is the job of our sponsor and management team to complete our initial business combination. Our management team is led by Tarek K. Tabsh,
our Chief Executive Officer, and Steven Berg, our Chief Financial Officer. We must complete our initial business combination during the
Combination Period. If our initial business combination is not consummated during the Combination Period, then, unless that time is extended,
our existence will terminate, and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account. 

SVES
Business Combination 

On
February 13, 2023, we entered into the Business Combination Agreement by and among Pubco, Merger Sub, SVES, the Sellers, the SVES Founders,
our sponsor (the Purchaser Representative and Timothy J. Fullum (the Seller Representative ). Capitalized
terms not defined but otherwise used in the following description have the meanings ascribed to them in the Business Combination Agreement. 

SVES
was founded in 2017 to fill a critical gap in the retail supply chain by providing full-price retail fashion brands an efficient and
effective way to monetize overstocked items. SVES differentiated business model includes a deep, two-sided buyer-seller network
built up through longstanding industry relationships and revolutionary sorting capabilities that drive superior customer service and
operational efficiency. These advantages have allowed SVES to unlock significant value for its customers by removing critical time- and
labor-intensive steps in the process of preparing off-price retail products for sale. SVES customer base includes a number of
leading off-price retailers in the United States and abroad, supported by multiple warehousing locations in the United States and Europe. 

1 

We
intend to file the SVES Registration Statement as soon as reasonably practicable and it is currently anticipated that the SVES Business
Combination will close in the third quarter of 2023. 

Consideration 

Pursuant
to the Business Combination Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, (a) the Merger Sub will merge with and
into the Company, with the Company surviving the business combination as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco, and (b) each Seller will
contribute all of its ownership interests in each Operating Company to Pubco in exchange for aggregate consideration in the amount of
 632,000,000 (the Contribution Consideration ), to be paid in the common stock of Pubco valued at 10.00 per share of common
stock. At the Closing, each public warrant of the Company shall be converted into one Pubco public warrant and each private warrant of
the Company shall be converted into one Pubco private warrant, in each case with such Pubco warrant having substantially the same terms
and conditions as set forth in the respective Company warrants, except that in each case they shall represent the right to acquire shares
of Pubco common stock in lieu of shares of our Class A common stock. 

Representations
and Warranties 

The
Business Combination Agreement contains a number of representations and warranties by each of the Company, Pubco, Merger Sub and the
Sellers. Many of the representations and warranties are qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect. Material Adverse
Effect as used in the Business Combination Agreement means with respect to any specified person, any fact, event, occurrence,
change or effect that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect upon
the business, assets, liabilities, results of operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of such person or and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or the ability of such person or any of its subsidiaries on a timely basis to consummate the transactions contemplated
by the Business Combination Agreement or the ancillary documents to which it is a party or bound or to perform its obligations thereunder,
in each case subject to certain customary exceptions. Certain of the representations are subject to specified exceptions and qualifications
contained in the Business Combination Agreement or in information provided pursuant to certain disclosure schedules to the Business Combination
Agreement. 

Survival

The
representations and warranties of the parties terminate as of and do not survive the Closing, and there are no indemnification rights
for another party s breach. The covenants and agreements of the parties shall not survive the Closing, except those covenants and
agreements to be performed after the Closing, which covenants and agreements shall survive until fully performed. 

Covenants
of the Parties 

Each
party agreed in the Business Combination Agreement to use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect the Closing. The
Business Combination Agreement also contains certain customary covenants by each of the parties during the period between the signing
of the Business Combination Agreement and the earlier of the Closing or the termination of the Business Combination Agreement in accordance
with its terms (the Interim Period ), including (1) the provision of access to their properties, books and personnel; (2)
the provision by Sellers of responses to the Company s, Pubco s and the Merger Sub s (collectively, the Purchaser
Parties due diligence requests; (3) provision of the audited financial statements of the Operating Companies by the Seller
Representative no later than April 7, 2023; (4) the Company making all required public filings; (5) no insider trading; (6) notifications
of certain breaches, consent requirements or other matters; (7) efforts to consummate the Closing; (8) continued listing of the Company s
securities on Nasdaq; (9) public announcements; (10) confidentiality; (11) further assurances and (12) the operation of their respective
businesses in the ordinary course of business; provided that in the case of the Operating Companies their only covenant is to not make
any dividend or distribution except consistent with past practices and to enter into related party transactions only on arms length
terms. Each party also agreed during the Interim Period not to solicit or enter into any written inquiry, proposal or offer, or any indication
of interest in making an offer or proposal for an alternative competing transactions, to notify the others as promptly as practicable
in writing of the receipt of any inquiries, proposals or offers, requests for information or requests relating to an alternative competing
transaction or any requests for non-public information relating to such transaction, and to keep the others informed of the status of
any such inquiries, proposals, offers or requests for information. There are also certain customary post-Closing covenants regarding
(1) tax matters; (2) maintenance of books and records; (3) indemnification of directors and officers;
and (4) use of trust account proceeds. During the Interim Period, the Company may, but is not required to, enter into financing agreements
on such terms as the Company and the Seller Representative agree (the Transaction Financing ). 

2 

The
Sellers agreed to use their good faith efforts to respond to the Purchaser Parties due diligence requests in a timely manner.
The Company shall have until 5:00 p.m. on March 15, 2023 (which date was subsequently amended by the First Amendment to the Business
Combination Agreement as set forth below), to conduct additional due diligence on the Operating Companies and their respective direct and indirect
subsidiaries (the Target Companies to determine whether any facts exist that would result, individually or in the
aggregate, in a reduction of the valuation of the Target Companies by an amount equal to or greater than five percent (5 of the
Contribution Consideration (such 5 reduction in valuation, a Material Reduction ). On March 20, 2023, the Company, the
Purchaser Representative and the Seller Representative entered into the First Amendment to the Business Combination Agreement to
extend the date to conduct additional due diligence on the Target Companies from 5:00 p.m. on March 15, 2023 to 5:00 p.m. to April
7, 2023. If, following the procedure described in the Business Combination Agreement, it is finally determined that there has been a
Material Reduction, the Company may terminate the Business Combination Agreement. Further, prior to the Closing, Seller
Representative is required to deliver to the Company updates to the Company Disclosure Schedules. In the event such updated Company
Disclosure Schedules set forth a fact that arises after the date of the Business Combination Agreement that results in a Material
Reduction, the procedures set forth in the Business Combination Agreement shall apply to the resolution of any such issue that may
arise.

of Company securities and the Sellers pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, and containing a proxy statement/prospectus for
the purpose of the Company soliciting proxies from our shareholders to approve the Business Combination Agreement and related matters

5 

Governing
Law 

The
Business Combination Agreement is governed by Delaware law and the parties are subject to exclusive jurisdiction of federal and state
courts located in the State of Delaware (and any appellate courts thereof). 

Other
than as specifically discussed, this Report does not assume the closing of the SVES Business Combination. 

Our
Business Strategy 

Our
business strategy has been to identify and complete our initial business combination with a target operating in the cannabis industry
that is compliant with all applicable laws and regulations within the jurisdictions in which it is located or operates, or with a company
that otherwise meets our criteria and that operates in another business, industry, or geographic location, including, but not limited
to, related industries such as consumer packaged goods, health wellness, technology, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, distribution,
logistics and brand management. 

Our
acquisition plan has been and will continue to be to leverage our management team s networks of potential transaction sources where
we believe a combination of our management team s industry relationships, knowledge and experience could effect a positive transformation
or augmentation of existing businesses or assets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed
a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships that have served as a useful source of acquisition opportunities. We have leveraged
relationships with management teams of public and private companies, investment professionals at private equity firms and other financial
sponsors, owners of private businesses, investment bankers, consultants, attorneys and accountants, which has provided us with a number
of business combination opportunities. 

Members
of our management team have communicated with their networks of relationships to articulate the parameters for our search for a target
business and a potential business combination and have pursued and reviewed potentially interesting leads, including SVES. 

Business
Combination Criteria 

We
have identified the following general criteria and guidelines which we believe have been important in evaluating prospective target businesses,
including SVES. While we utilize these criteria in evaluating business combination opportunities, including SVES, we expect that no individual
criterion will entirely determine a decision to pursue a particular opportunity, and we may decide to enter into our initial business
combination with a target business that meets some but not all of these criteria or guidelines. 

We
seek to acquire a company which: 

Has
an enterprise value of approximately 500 million to 1 billion; 

Has
a market and/or cost leadership position and would benefit from our management expertise and extensive relationships (i.e., rewards
stellar management 

Occupies
relatively fast-growing markets (i.e., top line growth 

Has
strong drivers of revenue and earnings growth and exhibits barriers to competition 

Has
the potential to generate strong and stable free cash flow; 

Is
underperforming its operating potential and underutilizing its balance sheet; and 

By
 creating strategic value offers an attractive risk-adjusted return for our stockholders. 

These
criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be
based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management
may deem relevant. 

6 

In
the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that meets some but not all of the above
criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business meets some but not all of the above criteria in our stockholder communications
related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Report, would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials
or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC, such as the SVES Registration Statement. 

Initial
Business Combination 

Nasdaq
rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the value
of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the business combination fee payable to A.G.P. and taxes payable on the interest earned
on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board
of directors engaged a fairness opinion provider, ValueScope, Inc. ValueScope ), an independent valuation consultant with
experience in the apparel industry to provide a fairness opinion. The opinion concluded that the fair market value of the Company s
equity ranges from 705 million to 782.3 million, which is in excess of the consideration paid in connection with the Business Combination.
determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently
determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking
firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider
it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial
business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if
there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target s assets or prospects. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq
rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors. Based on the valuation analysis
of our management and board of directors, we have determined that the fair market value of SVES was substantially in excess of 80 of
the funds in the trust account and that the 80 test was therefore satisfied. 

We
will have until August 15, 2023 to consummate an initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate
our initial business combination by August 15, 2023, we may, by resolution of our board if requested by our sponsor, extend the period
of time to consummate a business combination up to two times, each by an additional three months (for a total of up to 24 months to complete
a business combination), subject to the sponsor depositing additional funds into the trust account as set out below. Our stockholders
will not be entitled to vote or redeem their shares in connection with any such extension. However, our stockholders will be entitled
to vote and redeem their shares in connection with a general meeting held to approve an initial business combination or in a tender offer
undertaken in connection with such an initial business combination if we propose such a business combination during either Funded Extension
Period. If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination within the Combination Period (or any subsequently extended period
during which we must consummate our initial business combination), we will redeem 100 of our issued and outstanding public shares for
a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including
interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to 100,000 of interest
to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to applicable law and as further described
herein, and then seek to liquidate and dissolve. We anticipate structuring our initial business combination either (i) in such a way
so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100 of the equity interests or
assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100 
of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders,
or for other reasons. However, we will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires
50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient
for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company
owns or acquires 50 or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively
own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business
combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the
outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100 controlling interest in the target. However, as a result
of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own
less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100 of the equity interests
or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses
that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq s 80 of net assets test. If the initial business
combination involves more than one target business, the 80 of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions
and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder
approval, as applicable.

Our
Business Combination Process 

In
evaluating prospective business combinations, such as the SVES Business Combination, we continue to conduct a thorough due diligence
review process that encompasses, among other things, a review of historical data, meetings with management and their advisors (if applicable),
on-site inspection of facilities and assets, discussion with customers and suppliers, legal reviews and other reviews as we deem appropriate. 

We
also leverage our operational and capital allocation experience in order to: 

Assemble
a team of industry and financial experts: For each potential transaction, including the SVES Business Combination, we assemble a
team of industry and financial experts to supplement our management s efforts to identify and resolve key issues facing the company.
We construct an operating and financial plan which optimizes the potential to grow stockholder value. With extensive experience investing
in both healthy and underperforming businesses, our management will be able to demonstrate to the target business and its stakeholders
that we have the resources and expertise to lead the combined company through complex and often turbulent market conditions and provide
the strategic and operational direction necessary to grow the business in order to maximize cash flows and improve the overall strategic
prospects for the business; 

Conduct
rigorous research and analysis: Performing disciplined, bottom-up fundamental research and analysis is core to our strategy, and
we conduct extensive due diligence to evaluate the impact that a transaction may have on the target business; 

Acquire
the target company at an attractive price relative to our view of its intrinsic value: Combining rigorous bottom-up analysis as well
as input from industry and financial experts, the management team develops its view of the intrinsic value of the potential business
combination. In doing so, the management team evaluates future cash flow potential, relative industry valuation metrics and precedent
transactions to inform its view of intrinsic value, with the intention of creating a business combination at an attractive price relative
to such view; 

Implement
operating and financial structuring opportunities: Our management team has the ability to structure and execute a business combination
that will provide the combined business with a capital structure that will support growth in stockholder value and give the combined
company the flexibility needed to grow organically and/or through strategic acquisitions or divestitures. We also develop and implement
strategies and initiatives to improve the business s operating and financial performance and create a platform for growth; 

Seek
follow-on strategic acquisitions and divestitures to further grow stockholder value: The management team analyzes the strategic direction
of the company and evaluates non-core asset sales to create financial and/or operating flexibility needed for the company to engage in
organic or inorganic growth. Specifically, the management team evaluates opportunities for industry consolidation in the company s
core lines of business as well as opportunities to vertically or horizontally integrate with other industry participants; and 

Engage
A.G.P., a leading stockholder that brings deal flow and extensive understanding of capital markets and public market investors : We
are supported by A.G.P. and its team of investment banking professionals, each of whom has meaningful transaction experience, including
corporate finance, business combinations, mergers and acquisitions, equity and debt capital markets, strategic consulting and operations.
A.G.P. has developed an extensive network of contacts and corporate relationships which we believe provides us with an important source
of initial business combination opportunities. A.G.P. is a leading advisor to public company boards of directors and executives, including
technology companies, on matters of public markets capital raising, corporate strategy and M A. We believe that the significant knowhow
of A.G.P. allows us to effectively gauge target companies that possess a readiness for being public, as well as to support their executives
in the process of going public. 

8 

Following
our initial business combination, we intend to evaluate opportunities to enhance stockholder value, including developing and implementing
corporate strategies and initiatives to provide financial and operating runway such that the company can improve its profitability and
long-term value. In doing so, the management team anticipates evaluating corporate governance, opportunistically accessing capital markets
and other opportunities to enhance liquidity, identifying acquisition and divestiture opportunities and properly aligning management
and board incentives with growing stockholder value. 

We
are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers
or directors. While SVES is not affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, in the event we do not consummate the SVES
Business Combination and we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive
officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm
or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that our initial business combination is fair to our company and
our stockholders from a financial point of view. 

Our
Management Team 

Members
of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they devote as much of their time
as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any member of
our management team devotes in any time period has varied based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business
combination and the current stage of the business combination process. 

Our
management team s operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies has provided us with a substantial number
of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad
network of contacts and corporate relationships in various industries. This network has grown through the activities of our management
team sourcing, acquiring and financing businesses, our management team s relationships with sellers, financing sources and target
management teams and the experience of our management team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions. 

Status
as a Public Company 

Our
structure as a public company makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As a public company, we offer
a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a business combination or other business combination
with us. Following an initial business combination, we believe the target business would have greater access to capital and additional
means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with stockholders interests than it would as a private company.
A target business can further benefit by augmenting its profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented
employees. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of
stock in the target business for our shares of Class A common stock (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our
shares of Class A common stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. 

Although
there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a
more expeditious and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial
public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there
are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, marketing and road
show efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with an initial business combination with us. 

9 

Furthermore,
once a proposed initial business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial
public offering is always subject to the underwriters ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions,
which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Following an initial business
combination, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management
incentives consistent with stockholders interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public
company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting
talented employees. 

While
we believe that our structure and our management team s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential
target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our requirement to obtain
stockholder approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively. 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such,
we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies
that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent
registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding
executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory
vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find
our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities
may be more volatile. 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other
words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 

We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following February 15, 2027, (b)
in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer,
which means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the prior June 30 th ,
and (2) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 

Additionally,
we are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take
advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements.
We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held
by non-affiliates exceeds 250 million as of the end of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded 100 million during such
completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the prior June 30. 

Financial
Position 

With
funds available for an initial business combination as of December 31, 2022 in the amount of approximately 1,671,810, before payment
of a business combination fee of 5,031,250 and before fees and expenses associated with our initial business combination, and assuming
no redemptions, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital
for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt or leverage ratio. Because
we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing,
we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target
business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance
it will be available to us.

Effecting
Our Initial Business Combination 

We
are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we consummate our initial business combination. We intend
to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering (after redemptions) and the
private placement of the private placement units, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination
(including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of our initial
public offering or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target,
lines of credit arranged by the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with
a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the
numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 

If
our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account
are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A
common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for
maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred
in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 

We
may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial
business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the
amounts held in the trust account. In addition, we intend to target businesses larger than we could acquire with the net proceeds of
our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement units, and may as a result be required to seek additional financing
to complete such proposed initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete
such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. In the case of an initial business combination
funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the initial business
combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing.
There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately, or through loans in connection with our initial business combination.
At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds
through the sale of securities or otherwise. 

Sources
of Target Businesses 

Target
business candidates have been brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and investment
professionals. In the event that we do not consummate the SVES Business Combination, target businesses may be brought to our attention
by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us by calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target
businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read our prospectus
in connection with our initial public offering or this Report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors,
as well as our sponsor and their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through
their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or
conventions. In addition, we are supported by A.G.P. and its team of investment banking professionals, each of whom have meaningful transaction
experience, including in corporate finance, business combinations and acquisitions, equity and debt capital markets, strategic consulting
and operations. A.G.P. has developed an extensive network of contacts and corporate relationships which we believe provides us with an
important source of initial business combination opportunities. The collective experience, capability and network of our founders, directors
and officers, and A.G. P. combined with their individual and collective reputations in the investment community, has helped to create
prospective business combination opportunities. We received a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise
necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors and our sponsor and their affiliates.
We may engage the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions, in which event we may
pay a finder s fee, consulting fee, advisory fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm s length negotiation based
on the terms of the transaction. We will only pay a finder s fee, consulting fee, advisory fee or other compensation to the extent
such payment would be in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management
determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us
on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder s
fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account.
In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which our sponsor or officers
are affiliated, be paid any finder s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation
by the company prior to, or in connection with any services rendered for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion
of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). None of our sponsor, executive officers or directors,
or any of their respective affiliates, are allowed to receive any compensation, finder s fees or consulting fees from a prospective
business combination target in connection with a contemplated initial business combination. We pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total
of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support and reimburse our sponsor for any out-of-pocket
expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination. Some of our officers and directors may
enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination. The presence
or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an initial business combination
candidate. 

11 

We
are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with an initial business combination target that is affiliated with
our sponsor, officers or directors or making the initial business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership
with our sponsor, officers or directors. While SVES is not affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, in the event
we do not consummate the SVES Business Combination and we seek to complete our initial business combination with an initial business
combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors,
would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that
such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion
in any other context. 

If
any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an initial business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business
of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business
combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our officers and directors currently
have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. 

Selection
of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination 

Nasdaq
rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the value
of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the business combination fee payable to A.G.P. and taxes payable on the interest earned
on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair
market value of our initial business combination will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally
accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading multiples of comparable public
businesses or a valuation based on the financial metrics of M A transactions of comparable businesses. If our board of directors
is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent
investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.
While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value
of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular
target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target s assets or prospects. We do not intend to
purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement,
our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although
we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal
operations. 

In
any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities
of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100 of the equity interests or assets of a target business
or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be
taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq s 80 of net assets test. 

To
the extent we consummate our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early
stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will
endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess
all significant risk factors. 

In
evaluating a prospective business target, we continue to conduct a thorough due diligence review, which encompasses, among other things,
meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers and inspection of facilities,
as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us. 

The
time required to complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable
with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with
which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can
use to complete another business combination. 

12 

Lack
of Business Diversification 

For
an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely
on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with
multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate
the risks of being in a single line of business. In addition, we have focused and will continue to focus our search for an initial business
combination in a single industry. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification
may: 

subject
us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular
industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and 

cause
us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 

Limited
Ability to Evaluate the Target s Management Team 

Although
we closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business, including the management of SVES, when evaluating the desirability
of effecting our initial business combination with that business, and plan to continue to do so if the SVES Business Combination is not
consummated and we seek other business opportunities, our assessment of the target business management may not prove to be correct.
In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore,
the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The
determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time
of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with
us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent
to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience
or knowledge relating to the operations of a particular target business. 

Following
an initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business.
We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite
skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 

Stockholders
May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination 

We
may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval
if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule (as is the case in the SVES Business Combination as currently contemplated),
or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation
of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law
for each such transaction. 

Type of Transaction 
 Whether Stockholder Approval Is Required 
 
 Purchase of assets 
 No 
 
 Purchase of stock of target not involving a business combination with the company 
 No 
 
 Business combination of target into a subsidiary of the company 
 No 
 
 Business combination of the company with a target 
 Yes 

13 

Under
Nasdaq s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example: 

we
issue shares of Class A common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20 of the number of shares of our Class A common stock then
outstanding; 

any
of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5 or greater interest (or such persons collectively
have a 10 or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present
or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding common shares or voting power of 5 or more; or 

the
issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control. 

See
 SVES Business Combination above for more information on the requisite approvals needed for the SVES Business Combination. 

Permitted
Purchases of our Securities 

If
we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business
combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates
may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion
of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors
or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, they have
no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material
nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not
currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange
Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at
the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. Any such purchases
will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting
requirements. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions prior
to completion of our initial business combination. 

The
purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase
the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement
with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination,
where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce
the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection
with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination
that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our shares of Class
A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult
to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 

Our
sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsor, officers,
directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt
of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination.
To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify
and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the
trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such stockholder has already submitted a proxy with respect
to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will only purchase shares if such
purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. 

14 

Any
purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange
Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability
for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be
complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates
will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Any such purchases
will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchases are subject to such reporting
requirements. 

See
 SVES Business Combination above for more information regarding such purchases in the SVES Business Combination. 

Redemption
Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination 

We
will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the
completion of our initial business combination, such as the SVES Business Combination, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to
the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination
including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes,
divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account
was initially 10.20 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not
be reduced by the business combination fee payable to A.G.P. Our sponsor, officers, directors and initial stockholders have entered into
a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any shares of common
stock held by them, whether now or hereafter acquired, in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. 

Manner
of Conducting Redemptions 

We
will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the
completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the initial business
combination, such as with the SVES Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer, if the SVES Business Combination is not consummated.
The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed initial business combination or conduct a tender offer will
be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether
the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Under
Nasdaq rules, asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct business combinations
with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20 of our outstanding common stock or seek to
amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. If we structure an initial business combination
with a target company in a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder
vote to approve the proposed initial business combination. We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender
offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirements or we choose to seek stockholder
approval for business or other legal reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required
to comply with such rules. 

If
a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant
to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 

conduct
the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and 

file
tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial
and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange
Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 

Upon
the public announcement of our initial business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with
Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender
offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 

15 

In
the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days,
in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until
the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more
than a specified number of public shares which are not purchased by our sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we
will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least 5,000,001 either immediately
prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters fees and commissions (so that
we are not subject to the SEC s penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may
be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered
to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination. 

If,
however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder
approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 

conduct
the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation
of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and 

file
proxy materials with the SEC. 

In
the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection
therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination. 

At
the Special Meeting held on December 21, 2022, our stockholders approved the third amendment to our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to extend the date by which we must consummate our initial business combination from February 15, 2023 to August 15,
2023, or such earlier date as is determined by our board, and to provide for up to two additional three-month extensions beyond August
15, 2023 of the period of time for us to consummate an initial business combination, subject to our provision of an aggregate of 1,000
from our working capital into the trust account for each such Funded Extension Period. Upon our board s decision to extend the
date by which we must consummate our initial business combination to August 15, 2023, we were required to deposit an aggregate amount
of 10,000 from our working capital into the trust account seven calendar days before February 15, 2023. Our board has decided to implement
the extension to August 15, 2023 and such deposit was made into the trust account on January 26, 2023. 

We
filed our amended and restated certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on December 22, 2022.
In connection with the Special Meeting, stockholders holding 14,221,705 shares of Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem
such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account (approximately 10.29 per public share). 

On
February 27, 2023, we issued an aggregate of 3,593,749 shares of Class A common stock to our sponsor, A.G.P., George Syllantavos and
Anastasios Chrysostomidis, the holders of our Class B common stock, upon the conversion of an equal number of shares of Class B common
stock. These shares of class A common stock are subject to the same restrictions as applied to the Class B common stock before the conversion,
including, among other things, certain transfer restrictions, waiver of redemption rights and the obligation to vote in favor of an initial
business combination as described in the prospectus for our initial public offering. Following the conversion, our sponsor was the beneficial
owner of 3,033,905 shares of our Class A common stock and one share of our Class B common stock. The sponsor then transferred 533,525
shares of Class A common stock to certain members of the sponsor. Subsequent to those transfers, the sponsor holds 2,500,380 shares of
Class A common stock and one share of Class B common stock, as well as 653,750 shares of Class A common stock underlying private placement
units, which units were acquired by the sponsor in connection with the Company s initial public offering. 

Following
the redemptions and the conversion of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock, there are currently 153,295 public shares
outstanding and a total of 4,400,794 shares of Class A common stock and one share of Class B Common stock are outstanding, including
the 2,500,380 shares of Class A common stock and the one share of Class B common stock that are beneficially owned by our sponsor. 

16 

If
we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common
stock voted are voted in favor of the initial business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in
person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding
shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders will count toward this quorum and pursuant
to the letter agreement, our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote their founder shares, private placement shares, and
any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering (including in open market and privately negotiated transactions)
in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock
voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, because
our initial stockholders share holdings constitute approximately 56.82 of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, we
would not need any of the 153,295 outstanding public shares to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have
our initial business combination approved. We intend to give approximately 30 days (but not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days)
prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our initial business combination. These
quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, make it more likely that we will consummate our
initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or
against the proposed transaction. 

Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption)
our net tangible assets will be at least 5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination
and after payment of underwriters fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC s penny stock 
rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business
combination. For example, the proposed initial business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its
owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash
to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed initial business combination. In the event the aggregate cash
consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount
required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial business combination exceed the aggregate amount of
cash available to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A common stock
submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 

See
 SVES Business Combination above for more information on any redemptions associated with the SVES Business Combination. 

Tendering
Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights 

We
may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares
in street name, to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer
documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the initial
business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using
the DWAC System, at the holder s option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of
our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy
such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the
close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the initial business combination if we distribute proxy materials,
as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period,
it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 

There
is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through
the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker 100.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not
to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking
to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless
of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 

The
foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with
their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders vote on an initial
business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed initial business combination and check a box on the proxy card
indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the initial business combination was approved, the
company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result,
the stockholder then had an option window after the completion of the initial business combination during which he or she
could monitor the price of the company s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell
his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption
rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become option rights
surviving past the completion of the initial business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement
for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder s election to redeem is irrevocable once
the initial business combination is approved. 

17 

Any
request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the
date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered
its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect
to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed
promptly after the completion of our initial business combination. 

If
our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their
redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case,
we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 

If
our initial proposed initial business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete an initial business combination
with a different target until the end of the Combination Period. 

Ability
to Extend Time to Complete Business Combination 

If
we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination by August 15, 2023, we may extend the period of
time to consummate a business combination for up to two Funded Extension Periods without stockholder approval (for a total of up to 24
months after the consummation of our initial public offering to complete a business combination), so long as we deposit an aggregate
amount of 1,000 from our working capital into the trust account no later than the 21 month and 24 month anniversary of our IPO for each
such extension that we determine to implement. Our public stockholders will not be entitled to vote or redeem their shares in connection
with any Funded Extension Periods. In the event that we elect to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such
intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable
deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our board is not obligated to extend the time for us to complete
our initial business combination. 

Redemption
of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination 

Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have until the end of the Combination Period to complete our
initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination during the Combination Period, we will: (i)
cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days
thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust
account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income
taxes (less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption
will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions,
if any), subject to applicable law and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of
our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware
law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating
distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination by the
end of the Combination Period. 

Our
sponsor, officers, directors and initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived
their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete
our initial business combination by the end of the Combination Period. However, if our sponsor, officers or directors acquire public
shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect
to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by the end of the Combination Period. 

Our
sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100 of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by the end of the Combination Period or (ii) with respect to any other
provision relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders
with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable
in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes divided by the number of then outstanding public shares.
However, we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least 5,000,001
either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters fees and
commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC s penny stock rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised
with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement (described above),
we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. 

18 

If
we do not consummate our initial business combination by the end of the Combination Period, we expect that all costs and expenses associated
with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately
 1,71,493 of proceeds that was held outside the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for
such purpose. We will depend on sufficient interest being earned on the proceeds held in the trust account to pay any franchise and income
tax obligations we may owe. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our
plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay franchise and income taxes
on interest income earned on the trust account balance, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to 100,000
of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. 

If
we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement units, other than the
proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, and if our sponsor
did not elect to fund an extension as provided for in this Report, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our
dissolution is anticipated to be approximately 10.38. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to
the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the
actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than 10.38. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL,
our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full,
as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining
assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay
or provide for all creditors claims. 

Although
we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business
execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for
the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such
agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent
inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the
waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust
account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our
management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party
that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party s engagement would be significantly more
beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a
waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be
significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to
find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Withum, our independent registered public accounting firm, will not execute
agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. 

In
addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising
out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Our sponsor
has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us,
or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or
business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) 10.20 per public share and
(ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than
 10.20 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply
to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust
account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial
public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to
reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy
its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure
you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third
parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 

19 

In
the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) 10.20 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public
share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets,
in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy
its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors
would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect
that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to
us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the
cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent
directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations
and we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims
of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than 10.20 per public share. 

We
seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to
have all vendors, service providers (except our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other
entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies
held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial
public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. At the closing of our initial public offering,
as of February 15, 2022, we had access to up to up to 1,565,000 from the proceeds of our initial public offering, (not including amounts
held in the trust account) which is held outside of the trust account with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and
expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately 100,000) as well as expenses
incurred as a result of being a public company or in connection with identifying and conducting due diligence on a target for an initial
business combination. 

Under
the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by
them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public
shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination by the end of the Combination Period may be considered a liquidating
distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to
ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims
can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional
150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a
liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to
the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 

Furthermore,
if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event
we do not complete our initial business combination by the end of the Combination Period is not considered a liquidating distribution
under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings
that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute
of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as
in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by the end of the Combination
Period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more
than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then
on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to
pay our franchise and income taxes (less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding
public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to
receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following
such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in
each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly,
it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the end of the Combination Period and, therefore,
we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent
of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of
such date. 

20 

Because
we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such
time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within
the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be
limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as
lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our
underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which
we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust
account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any
claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent
necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) 10.20 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount
per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the
trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity
of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the
event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent
of any liability for such third-party claims. 

If
we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the
trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of
third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot
assure you we will be able to return 10.20 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an
involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed
under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. 
As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors
may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and
our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors.
We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 

Our
public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of
our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to
amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation
to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by the end of the Combination Period or (B)
with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity and (iii) the
redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination by the end of the Combination Period, subject
to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In
the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder s voting in connection
with the initial business combination alone will not result in a stockholder s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro
rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights as described above. These provisions
of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, like all provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation,
may be amended with a stockholder vote. 

21 

Competition 

In
identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, such as SVES, we have encountered and may
continue to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check
companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of
these entities are well-established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through
affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability
to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage
in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public
stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our
outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either
of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 

Employees 

We
currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote
as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time
they devote in any time period varies based on the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have
any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. 

Periodic
Reporting and Financial Information 

Our
units, Class A common stock and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act, and as a result, we have reporting obligations, including
the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange
Act, our annual reports, including this Report, contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public
accounting firm. 

We
will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials
or proxy solicitation materials, such as the SVES Registration Statement, sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target
business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, U.S. GAAP, or
IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential targets we may conduct an initial business combination
with because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal
proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular
target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements
outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While
this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 

We
are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth
company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity
to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination.
We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange
Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing
a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial
business combination. 

We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following February 15, 2027, (b)
in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer,
which means the market value of our shares of Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the prior
June 30 th , and (2) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year
period. 

22 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

As
a smaller reporting company under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include risk factors in this Report. However,
below is a partial list of material risks, uncertainties and other factors that could have a material effect on the Company and its operations: 

we
are a blank check company with no revenue or basis to evaluate our ability to select a suitable business target; 

we
may not be able to select an appropriate target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination in the prescribed
time frame, including the SVES Business Combination; 

our
expectations around the performance of a prospective target business or businesses, such as SVES, may not be realized; 

we
may not be successful in retaining or recruiting required officers, key employees or directors following our initial business combination; 

our
officers and directors may have difficulties allocating their time between the Company and other businesses and may potentially have
conflicts of interest with our business or in approving our initial business combination; 

we
may not be able to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, including the SVES Business Combination,
or reduce the number of stockholders requesting redemption; 

we
may issue our shares to investors in connection with our initial business combination, including the SVES Business Combination, at a
price that is less than the prevailing market price of our shares at that time; 

you
may not be given the opportunity to choose the initial business target or to vote on the initial business combination; 

trust
account funds may not be protected against third party claims or bankruptcy; 

our public securities potential liquidity and trading,
including the determination of the Nasdaq staff to halt trading in our public shares, units and public warrants (each as defined below)
on January 11, 2023, and the Nasdaq staff s determination to delist the Company s securities from the Nasdaq Global Market,
in a letter dated January 12, 2023; 

an
active market for our public securities may not exist and you will have limited liquidity and trading; 

the
availability to us of funds from interest income on the trust account balance may be insufficient to operate our business prior to the
business combination; 

our
financial performance following a business combination with an entity may be negatively affected by their lack an established record
of revenue, cash flows and experienced management; 

there
may be more competition to find an attractive target for an initial business combination, which could increase the costs associated with
completing our initial business combination and may result in our inability to find a suitable target; 

changes
in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and
complete an initial business combination; 

23 

we
may attempt to simultaneously complete business combinations with multiple prospective targets, which may hinder our ability to complete
our initial business combination and give rise to increased costs and risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability; 

we
have entered into a business combination marketing agreement with A.G.P. to act as an advisor to us after the initial public offering
in connection with an initial business combination. A.G.P. is entitled to a fee in connection with that business combination marketing
agreement that will be payable from the trust account only upon a completion of an initial business combination. In addition, we may
engage one or more of our underwriters or one of their respective affiliates to provide additional services to us after the initial public
offering, which may include acting as a financial advisor in connection with an initial business combination or as placement agent in
connection with a related financing transaction. These financial incentives may cause them to have potential conflicts of interest in
rendering any such additional services to us after the initial public offering, including, for example, in connection with the sourcing
and consummation of an initial business combination; 

we
may attempt to complete our initial business combination with a private company about which little information is available, which may
result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all; 

our
warrants are accounted for as derivative liabilities and are recorded at fair value upon issuance with changes in fair value each period
reported in earnings, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock or may make it more difficult for us to
consummate an initial business combination; 

since
our initial stockholders will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed (other than with
respect to any public shares they may acquire during or after our initial public offering), and because our sponsor, officers and directors
may profit substantially even under circumstances in which our public stockholders would experience losses in connection with their investment,
a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business
combination; 

changes
in laws or regulations or how such laws or regulations are interpreted or applied, or a failure to comply with any laws or regulations,
may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations; 

the
value of the founder shares following completion of our initial business combination is likely to be substantially higher than the nominal
price paid for them, even if the trading price of our common stock at such time is substantially less than 10.20 per share; 

resources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not
completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to identify and acquire or merge with another business.
If we have not completed our initial business combination within the Combination Period, our public stockholders may receive only approximately
 10.20 per share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will
expire worthless; 

in
March 2022, the SEC issued proposed rules relating to certain activities of SPACs. Certain of the procedures that we, a potential business
combination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with such proposals may increase our costs and the time needed
to complete our initial business combination and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete an initial business combination.
The need for compliance with such proposals may cause us to liquidate the funds in the trust account or liquidate the Company at an earlier
time than we might otherwise choose; 

if
we are deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we would be required to institute burdensome compliance
requirements and our activities would be severely restricted. As a result, in such circumstances, unless we are able to modify our activities
so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we may abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead
liquidate the Company; 

to
mitigate the risk that we might be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we may, at any time, 
 instruct the trustee to liquidate the investments held in the trust account and instead to hold the funds in the trust account
in an interest bearing demand deposit account until the earlier of the consummation of our initial business combination or our liquidation.
As a result, following the liquidation of investments in the trust account, we would likely receive less interest on the funds held in
the trust account, which would likely reduce the dollar amount our public stockholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation
of the Company; 

we
may not be able to complete an initial business combination with certain potential target companies if a proposed transaction with the
target company may be subject to review or approval by regulatory authorities pursuant to certain U.S. or foreign laws or regulations,
including the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States; 

recent
increases in inflation and interest rates in the United States and elsewhere could make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial
business combination; 

24 

military
conflict in Ukraine or elsewhere may lead to increased price volatility for publicly traded securities, which could make it more difficult
for us to consummate an initial business combination; 

a
1 U.S. federal excise tax may be imposed on us in connection with our redemptions of shares in connection with a business combination
or other stockholder vote pursuant to which stockholders would have a right to submit their shares for redemption; . 

there
is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 

adverse
developments affecting the financial services industry, including events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance
by financial institutions, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or our prospects. 

Our
business may be adversely impacted by these developments in ways that we cannot predict at this time, there may be additional risks that
we have not yet identified, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to avoid negative consequences directly or indirectly from any
failure of one or more banks or other financial institutions. 

We
have received a determination letter from the Nasdaq staff indicating that the Company was not in compliance with several Nasdaq continued
listing requirements and that, as a result, the Nasdaq staff had determined to delist the Company s securities from The Nasdaq
Global Market. 

On
January 12, 2023, we received a determination letter (the Determination Letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications
staff (the Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq indicating that the Company was not in compliance
with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Listing Rules set forth in (i) Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A), requiring a minimum
of 50 million Market Value of Listed Securities, (ii) Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(B), requiring a minimum 1,100,000 Publicly Held Shares,
and (iii) Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(C), requiring a minimum of 15 million in Market Value of Publicly Held Shares. In addition, the Determination
Letter stated that the Company does not comply with either of the alternative requirements for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global
Market under Listing Rules 5450(b)(1) or 5450(b)(3), or the requirements for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Listing
Rule 5550. The Determination Letter also indicated that the Staff had concerns that the Company may no longer comply with the minimum
400 Total Holders requirement of Listing Rule 5450(a)(2) due to the substantial number of shareholder redemptions and low number of shares
remaining outstanding. Additionally, the Determination Letter indicated that, while companies are normally afforded compliance periods
or the ability to submit a plan of compliance in order to be granted time to regain compliance, the Staff had determined to apply a more
stringent criteria as permitted under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5101 to delist the Company s securities from The Nasdaq Global Market.
As a result, the Determination Letter indicated that the Staff had determined to delist the Company s securities from The Nasdaq
Global Market. The Staff s determination was based on the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with Securities and
Exchange Commission (the SEC on December 28, 2022, in which the Company disclosed that 14,221,705 shares of Class A common
stock exercised their redemption rights in connection with a special meeting of stockholders held on December 21, 2022. In addition,
on January 11, 2023, the Staff determined to halt trading in the Company s securities. 

The
Company had a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel on March 2, 2023, to appeal the Staff s delisting determination. That hearing stays any suspension or delisting of the Company s securities, and the
Company s securities will continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Global Market until the hearing process concludes and the Panel
issues a written decision following the hearing. 

There
can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company s continued listing on Nasdaq.

If
Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities
exchange, we expect our securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material
adverse consequences, including: 

a limited availability
 of market quotations for our securities; 

reduced liquidity for our
 securities; 

a determination that our
 Class A common stock is a penny stock which will require brokers trading in our Class A common stock to adhere to more
 stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; 

a limited amount of news
 and analyst coverage; 

a decreased ability to
 issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future; and 

being
subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities, including in connection with our initial business combination. 

Adverse
 developments affecting the financial services industry, including events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance
 by financial institutions, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or our prospects. 
 
 The
 funds in our operating account and our trust account are held in banks or other financial institutions. Our cash held in non-interest
 bearing and interest-bearing accounts would exceed any applicable Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insurance
 limits. Should events, including limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments occur with respect to
 the banks or other financial institutions that hold our funds, or that affect financial institutions or the financial services industry
 generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks, our liquidity may be adversely affected.
 For example, on March 10, 2023, the FDIC announced that Silicon Valley Bank had been closed by the California Department of Financial
 Protection and Innovation. We cannot guarantee that the banks or other financial institutions that hold our funds will not experience
 similar issues. 
 
 In
 addition, investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result in less favorable commercial financing
 terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access
 to credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it more difficult for us to acquire financing on terms favorable to us in connection
 with a potential business combination, or at all, and could have material adverse effect. Our business may be adversely impacted
 by these developments in ways that we cannot predict at this time, there may be additional risks that we have not yet identified
 and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to avoid negative consequences directly or indirectly from any failure of one or more
 banks or other financial institutions. 

For
the complete list of risks relating to our operations, see the section titled Risk Factors contained in our (i) IPO Registration
Statement, (ii) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on March 31, 2022, (iii) Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022, and September 30, 2022, as filed with the SEC on
May 16, 2022, August 15, 2022, and November 14, 2022, respectively, and (iv) Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, as filed with
the SEC on December 5, 2022. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations
or financial condition. Additional risks could arise that may also affect our business or ability to consummate an initial business combination.
We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC.

with the requirements of the Nasdaq Listing Rules set forth in (i) Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A), requiring a minimum of 50 million Market
Value of Listed Securities, (ii) Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(B), requiring a minimum 1,100,000 Publicly Held Shares, and (iii) Listing Rule

Listing Rules 5450(b)(1) or 5450(b)(3), or the requirements for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Listing Rule 5550.
The Determination Letter also indicated that the Nasdaq staff had concerns that the Company may no longer comply with the minimum 400
Total Holders requirement of Listing Rule 5450(a)(2) due to the substantial number of stockholder redemptions in connection with our
Special Meeting and the low number of shares remaining outstanding. Additionally, the Determination Letter indicated that, while companies
are normally afforded compliance periods or the ability to submit a plan of compliance in order to be granted time to regain compliance,
the Nasdaq staff had determined to apply more stringent criteria as permitted under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5101 to delist the Company s
securities from The Nasdaq Global Market. As a result, the Determination Letter indicated that the Nasdaq staff had determined to delist

to halt trading in the Company s securities. 

The
Company requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel to appeal the Nasdaq staff s delisting determination,

the Company s securities will continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Global Market until the hearing process concludes and the Panel
issues a written decision following the hearing. At this juncture, the Company is unable to provide assurance as to if and when the trading
halt will be released and there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company s request for continued listing on Nasdaq.

Recent
Developments 

On
February 13, 2023, we entered into the Business Combination Agreement with (i) Pubco, (ii) the Merger Sub, (iii) SVES, (iv) the Sellers,
(v) the SVES Founders, (vi) our sponsor as the purchaser representative, and (vii) Timothy J. Fullum as the seller representative, as
was amended on March 20, 2023, and as may be further amended from time to time. SVES is a key intermediary connecting full-price fashion
brands with off-price retailers that are able to sell inventory that would otherwise be sold or disposed of by full-price brands at a
significant loss. At the closing of the SVES Business Combination, in accordance with the DGCL, (a) the Merger Sub will merge with and
into the Company, with the Company surviving the business combination as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco, and (b) each Seller will
contribute all of its ownership interest in each Operating Company to Pubco in exchange for aggregate consideration in the amount of
 632,000,000, to be paid in the common stock of Pubco valued at 10.00 per share of common stock and (c) each of our public warrants
will be converted into one Pubco public warrant and each of our private placement warrants will be converted into one Pubco private warrant,
in each case with such Pubco warrant having substantially the same terms and conditions as set forth in our respective warrants, except
that in each case they will represent the right to acquire shares of Pubco common stock in lieu of shares of our Class A common stock. 

On January 12, 2023, we received
a determination letter (the Determination Letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications staff (the Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq indicating that the Company was not in compliance with the continued listing requirements
of the Nasdaq Listing Rules set forth in (i) Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A), requiring a minimum of 50 million Market Value of Listed Securities,
(ii) Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(B), requiring a minimum 1,100,000 Publicly Held Shares, and (iii) Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(C), requiring a
minimum of 15 million in Market Value of Publicly Held Shares. In addition, the Determination Letter stated that the Company does not
comply with either of the alternative requirements for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market under Listing Rules 5450(b)(1) or
5450(b)(3), or the requirements for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Listing Rule 5550. The Determination Letter also
indicated that the Staff had concerns that the Company may no longer comply with the minimum 400 Total Holders requirement of Listing
Rule 5450(a)(2) due to the substantial number of shareholder redemptions and low number of shares remaining outstanding. 

The Company had a hearing
before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel on March 2, 2023, to appeal the Staff s delisting determination. That hearing stays any suspension
or delisting of the Company s securities, and the Company s securities will continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Global Market
until the hearing process concludes and the Panel issues a written decision following the hearing. 

29 

For
a full description of the Business Combination Agreement and the proposed SVES Business Combination, please see Item 1. Business. 

On February 27, 2023, we issued
an aggregate of 3,593,749 shares of Class A common stock to our sponsor, A.G.P., George Syllantavos and Anastasios Chrysostomidis, the
holders of our Class B common stock, upon the conversion of an equal number of shares of Class B common stock. These shares of class A
common stock are subject to the same restrictions as applied to the Class B common stock before the conversion, including, among other
things, certain transfer restrictions, waiver of redemption rights and the obligation to vote in favor of an initial business combination
as described in the prospectus for our initial public offering. Following the conversion, our sponsor was the beneficial owner of 3,033,905
shares of our Class A common stock and one share of our Class B common stock. The sponsor then transferred 533,525 shares of Class A common
stock to certain members of the sponsor. Subsequent to those transfers, the sponsor holds 2,500,380 shares of Class A common stock and
one share of Class B common stock, as well as 653,750 shares of Class A common stock underlying private placement units, which units were
acquired by the sponsor in connection with the Company s initial public offering. 

On March 20, 2023, the Company, the Purchaser Representative
and the Seller Representative entered into the First Amendment to the Business Combination Agreement to extend the date to conduct additional
due diligence on the Target Companies from 5:00 p.m. on March 15, 2023 to 5:00 p.m. on April 7, 2023. 

Results
of Operations 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from April 13, 2021 (inception) through December
31, 2022 relates to our formation and initial public offering and identifying a target company for an initial business combination. We
will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a business combination, at the earliest. We will generate non-operating
income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the initial public offering and placed in the trust account. 

For the year ended
December 31, 2022, we had net income of 4,752,895, which consists of interest income from investments held in trust account of
 2,049,399 and change in fair value of warrant liability of 4,356,766, offset by formation and operating costs of 1,104,757,
warrant issuance cost of 125,175 and provision for income taxes of 423,338. 

For
the period from April 13, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, we had a net loss of 7,102, which consisted solely of the formation
and operating costs. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,429,804 in our operating bank account
and working capital, excluding franchise and income tax payable net of interest income from the trust account, of 1,147,521. 

On
February 15, 2022, we consummated the initial public offering of 14,375,000 units, including 1,875,000 units pursuant to the exercise
of the underwriters over-allotment option in full, at 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of 143,750,000. 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the initial public offering, we consummated the sale of 653,750 private placement units at a price of 10.00 per
private placement units in the private placement to our sponsor, generating total gross proceeds of 6,537,500. 

Transaction
costs amounted to 3,890,326, consisting of 1,437,500 of underwriting commissions, 1,972,398 of the excess of the fair value of Class
B common stock issued to underwriter over the share subscription receivable and 480,428 of other offering costs. 

Following
the closing of our initial public offering, 146,625,000.00 from the net proceeds of the sale of the units in our initial public offering
and the sale of the private placement units was placed in the trust account maintained by Continental, as trustee. In connection with
our Special Meeting held on December 21, 2022, stockholders holding 14,221,705 public shares exercised their right to redeem such shares
for a pro rata portion of the funds in our trust account. As a result, approximately 146 million (approximately 10.29 per public share)
was removed from the trust account to pay such holders. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 1,671,810 remained in the trust account. 

In
connection with the redemptions of public shares, a total of 133,689 was deducted from our trust account in order to pay taxes prior
to the Special Meeting, which amount had later been determined to be withheld in excess and should be returned to the public stockholders.
As such, a portion of this rebate was sent to the financial institutions that had tendered share redemptions on behalf of their investor
clients ahead of the Special Meeting and the balance to the trust account. The redemption rebate payments total 132,263 0.00930008
per redeemed share), with 1,426 returned in the trust account. 

30 

We
intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust
account, to complete our initial business combination. We may withdraw interest to pay our taxes and liquidation expenses if we are unsuccessful
in completing a business combination. We may pay our franchise taxes from funds from the initial public offering held outside of the
trust account or from interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and released to us for this purpose. Our annual income tax
obligations will depend on the amount of interest and other income earned on the amounts held in the trust account reduced by our operating
expense and franchise taxes. We expect the interest earned on the amount in the trust account will be sufficient to pay our income taxes.
To the extent that our equity or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the
remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses,
make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 

Further,
our sponsor or an affiliate of the sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may
be required for Working Capital Loans. If we complete a business combination, we would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds
of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account.
In the event that a business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to
repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds from the trust account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Up to 1,500,000
of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into units at a price of 10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. The units would
be identical to the private placement units. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, no Working Capital Loans were outstanding. 

We
do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However,
if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination
are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our business
combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our business combination or because we become obligated
to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon consummation of our business combination, in which case we may issue additional
securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would
only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. If we are unable to complete our business
combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account.
In addition, following our business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order
to meet our obligations. 

Further,
we have determined that if we are unable to complete a business combination within the Combination Period, then we will (i)
cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days
thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such
redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate. The date for mandatory
liquidation and subsequent dissolution as well as our working capital deficit raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as
a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should we be required to liquidate after
the applicable extension date. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Emerging
Growth Company Status 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may
take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging
growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements,
and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any
golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

31 

Further,
Section 102(b)(1) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2021 (the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth
companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those
that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under
the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a
company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth
companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which
means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we as an
emerging growth company can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This
may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an
emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential
differences in accounting standards used. 

Use
of Estimates 

This management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The preparation
of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment.
It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the
date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or
more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We determined the more
significant accounting estimates included in our financial statements is the determination of the fair value of Derivative Financial Instruments. 

We have identified the following
as our critical accounting estimates: 

Derivative
Financial Instruments 

We evaluate our financial instruments to determine if such instruments
are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging .
For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, such as the Company s public warrants and private placement
warrants, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value on the grant date and is then re-valued at each reporting
date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including
whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative
liabilities are classified in the balance sheets as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of
the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. 

The valuation of our public
warrants are based on a traded market. Our private placement warrants are valued using a Monte Carlo options pricing model which utilizes
assumptions related to expected stock-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates
the volatility of its common stock based on projected volatility of comparable public companies that matches the expected remaining life
of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar
to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is based on management assumptions regarding the timing
and likelihood of completing a Business Combination. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates
to remain at zero. 

The estimates used to calculate
the fair value of our derivative assets and liabilities change at each balance sheet date based on our stock price and other assumptions
described above. If our assumptions change or we experience significant volatility in our stock price or interest rates, the fair value
calculated from one balance sheet period to the next could be materially different.

Common
Stock Subject to Possible Redemption 

Our
Class A common stock that was sold as part of the units in the initial public offering contains a redemption feature which allows for
the redemption of such public shares in connection with our liquidation, or if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection
with our initial business combination. In accordance with ASC Topic 480-10-S99, we classify such public shares subject to redemption
outside of permanent equity as the redemption provisions are not solely within our control. The public shares sold as part of the units
in the initial public offering were issued with other freestanding instruments (i.e., warrants) and as such, the initial carrying value
of public shares classified as temporary equity was the allocated proceeds determined in accordance with ASC Topic 470-20 Debt Debt
with Conversion and Other Options ). The public shares are subject to ASC 480-10-S99 and are currently not redeemable as the redemption
is contingent upon the occurrence of events mentioned above. According to ASC 480-10-S99-15, no subsequent adjustment is needed if it
is not probable that the instrument will become redeemable. 

Accordingly, as of
December 31, 2022, 153,295 shares of Class A common stock subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as
temporary equity, outside of the shareholders equity section of our balance sheet. The change in the carrying value of
redeemable shares of Class A common stock resulted in charges against accumulated deficit. 

In
connection with the Special Meeting on December 21, 2022, stockholders holding 14,221,705 shares of Class A common stock exercised their
right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account (approximately 10.29 per public share). Following
the redemptions, as of December 31, 2022, there were 153,295 public shares outstanding and a total of 807,045 shares of Class A common
stock were outstanding, including the 653,750 shares of Class A common stock that were beneficially owned by our sponsor. Following the
conversion of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock on February 27, 2023, and subsequent transactions, there are currently
153,295 public shares outstanding and a total of 4,400,794 shares of Class A common stock are outstanding, including the 2,500,380 shares
of Class A common stock and the one share of Class B common stock that are beneficially owned by our sponsor. 

Recent
Accounting Standards 

In
August 2020, Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20), and Derivatives
and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) ASU 2020-06 to simplify accounting
for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash
conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification
of contracts in an entity s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding
instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance,
including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We adopted ASU 2020-06 effective
as of April 13, 2021. That adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have an impact on our financial statements. 

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a
material effect on our financial statements. 

Factors
That May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations 

Our
results of operations and our ability to complete an initial business combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could
cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted
by, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, the risk of a bank failure or failures, increases
in oil prices, inflation, increases in interest rates, supply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, the ongoing
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including resurgences and the emergence of new variants, and geopolitical instability, such as the
military conflict in Ukraine. We cannot at this time fully predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration
or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete an initial business combination.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Certifying Officers, we carried out an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions.

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

As
required by SEC rules and regulations implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting
purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

(1) 
 pertain to
 the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
 of our company, 

(2) 
 provide reasonable assurance
 that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts
 and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and 

(3) 
 provide reasonable assurance
 regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material
 effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our financial
statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making these assessments, management used
the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated
Framework (2013). Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that we maintain effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. 

Management
has implemented remediation steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, we expanded and improved our
review process for complex securities and related accounting standards. We plan to further improve this process by enhancing access to
accounting literature, identification of third-party professions with whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications and consideration
of additional staff with the requisite experience and training to supplement existing accounting professionals. 

This
Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm
due to our status as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 that materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Number
and Terms of Office of Officers and Directors 

We
currently have four directors. Our board of directors is divided into two classes with only one class of directors being elected in each
year and each class (except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual meeting of stockholders) serving a two-year term.
In accordance with Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual meeting until one year after our first
fiscal year end following our listing on Nasdaq. The term of office of the first class of directors, consisting of Francis Knuettel II
and Emily Paxhia, and will expire at our first annual meeting of stockholders. The term of office of the second class of directors, consisting
of Tarek Tabsh and John Anthony Quelch, will expire at the second annual meeting of stockholders. 

Our
officers are appointed by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms
of office. Our board of directors is authorized to appoint persons to the offices set forth in our bylaws as it deems appropriate. Our
bylaws provide that our officers may consist of a Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President,
Vice Presidents, Secretary, Treasurer, Assistant Secretaries and such other offices as may be determined by the board of directors. 

38 

Committees
of the Board of Directors 

Our
board of directors has three standing committees: an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance
committee. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, the rules of Nasdaq and Rule 10A of the Exchange Act require that the audit
committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, the rules
of Nasdaq require that the compensation committee and the nominating and corporate governance committee of a listed company be comprised
solely of independent directors. Each committee operates under a charter that has been approved by our board and has the composition
and responsibilities described below. The charter of each committee is available on our website www.relativityacquisitions.com. 

Audit
Committee 

We
have established an audit committee of the board of directors. Francis Knuettel II, John Anthony Quelch and Emily Paxhia serve as members
of our audit committee, and Mr. Knuettel chairs the audit committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we
are required to have at least three members of the audit committee, all of whom must be independent. Each of Mr. Knuettel, Mr. Quelch
and Ms. Paxhia meet the independent director standard under Nasdaq listing standards and under Rule 10-A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act. 

Each
member of the audit committee is financially literate and our board of directors has determined that Mr. Knuettel qualifies as an audit
committee financial expert as defined in applicable SEC rules and has accounting or related financial management expertise. 

We
have adopted an audit committee charter, which details the principal functions of the audit committee, including: 

the
appointment, compensation, retention, replacement, and oversight of the work of the independent registered public accounting firm engaged
by us; 

pre-approving
all audit and permitted non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us, and establishing
pre-approval policies and procedures; 

setting
clear hiring policies for employees or former employees of the independent registered public accounting firm, including but not limited
to, as required by applicable laws and regulations; 

setting
clear policies for audit partner rotation in compliance with applicable laws and regulations; 

obtaining
and reviewing a report, at least annually, from the independent registered public accounting firm describing (i) the independent registered
public accounting firm s internal quality-control procedures, (ii) any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control
review, or peer review, of the audit firm, or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities within the
preceding five years respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the firm and any steps taken to deal with such issues and
(iii) all relationships between the independent registered public accounting firm and us to assess the independent registered public
accounting firm s independence; 

reviewing
and approving any related party transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC prior
to us entering into such transaction; and 

reviewing
with management, the independent registered public accounting firm, and our legal advisors, as appropriate, any legal, regulatory or
compliance matters, including any correspondence with regulators or government agencies and any employee complaints or published reports
that raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies and any significant changes in accounting standards
or rules promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. 

39 

Compensation
Committee 

We
have established a compensation committee of the board of directors. Emily Paxhia and John Anthony Quelch serve as members of our compensation
committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least two members of the compensation
committee, all of whom must be independent. Ms. Paxhia and Mr. Quelch are independent, and Ms. Paxhia chairs the compensation committee. 

We
have adopted a compensation committee charter, which details the principal functions of the compensation committee, including: 

reviewing
and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officers compensation, if
any is paid by us, evaluating our Chief Executive Officer s performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and
approving the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officer based on such evaluation; 

reviewing
and approving on an annual basis the compensation, if any is paid by us, of all of our other officers; 

reviewing
on an annual basis our executive compensation policies and plans; 

implementing
and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans; 

assisting
management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements; 

approving
all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our officers and employees; 

if
required, producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and 

reviewing,
evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors. 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, as indicated above, other than the payment to an affiliate of our sponsor of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities
and secretarial and administrative support and reimbursement of expenses, no compensation of any kind, including finders, consulting
or other similar fees, has been or will be paid to any of our existing stockholders, officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates,
prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate the consummation of an initial business combination. Accordingly, it
is likely that prior to the consummation of an initial business combination, the compensation committee will only be responsible for
the review and recommendation of any compensation arrangements to be entered into in connection with such initial business combination. 

The
charter also provides that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant,
legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such
adviser. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the
compensation committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC. 

Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committee 

We
have established a nominating and corporate governance committee of the board of directors. Francis Knuettel II and John Anthony Quelch
serve as members of our nominating and corporate governance committee. Mr. Knuettel and Mr. Quelch are independent, and Mr. Knuettel
chairs the nominating and corporate governance committee. Our nominating and corporate governance committee will recommend to the board
of directors candidates for nomination for election at the annual meeting of the stockholders. Prior to our initial business combination,
the board of directors will also consider director candidates recommended for nomination by holders of our founder shares during such
times as they are seeking proposed nominees to stand for election at an annual meeting of stockholders (or, if applicable, a special
meeting of stockholders). Prior to our initial business combination, holders of our public shares will not have the right to recommend
director candidates for nomination to our board of directors. 

40 

We
have not formally established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess.
In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, the board of directors considers educational background, diversity of
professional experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom and the ability to represent
the best interests of our stockholders. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
have adopted a Code of Conduct and Ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees. We have filed a copy of our form of the
Code of Conduct and Ethics and our audit committee and the charters of our committees as exhibits to the IPO Registration Statement and
a copy is posted on our website: www.relativityacquisitions.com. You also can review these documents by accessing our public filings
at the SEC s website at www.sec.gov . In addition, a copy of the Code of Conduct and Ethics and the charters of the committees
will be provided without charge upon request from us. If we make any amendments to our Code of Conduct and Ethics other than technical,
administrative or other non-substantive amendments, or grant any waiver, including any implicit waiver, from a provision of the Code
of Conduct and Ethics applicable to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer principal accounting officer or controller
or persons performing similar functions requiring disclosure under applicable SEC or Nasdaq rules, we will disclose the nature of such
amendment or waiver on our website. The information included on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Report or in any
other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our website are intended to be inactive textual references only. 

Item
11. Executive Compensation. 

Other
than disclosed herein, none of our officers has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. We pay an affiliate of our
sponsor a total of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. No compensation of any kind, including any finder s
fee, reimbursement, consulting fee or monies in respect of any payment of a loan, has been or will be paid by us to our sponsor, officers
and directors, or any affiliate of our sponsor or officers, prior to, or in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate,
the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, these individuals are
reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses
and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee reviews on a quarterly basis all payments that were
made to our sponsor, officers or directors, or our or their affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial business combination will
be made using funds held outside the trust account. Other than quarterly audit committee review of such payments, we do not expect to
have any additional controls in place governing our reimbursement payments to our directors and executive officers for their out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with identifying and consummating an initial business combination. 

After
the completion of our initial business combination, directors or members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting
or management fees from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in
the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders in connection with a proposed initial business
combination, such as the SVES Registration Statement. We have not established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by
the combined company to our directors or members of management. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time
of the proposed initial business combination, because the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining
officer and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid to our officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors
for determination, either by a compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent
directors on our board of directors. 

41 

We
do not intend to take any action to ensure that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the consummation
of our initial business combination, although it is possible that some or all of our officers and directors may negotiate employment
or consulting arrangements to remain with us after our initial business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or
consulting arrangements to retain their positions with us may influence our management s motivation in identifying or selecting
a target business but we do not believe that the ability of our management to remain with us after the consummation of our initial business
combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential business combination. We are not party to any
agreements with our officers and directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment. 

Item
12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters. 

The
following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of March 30, 2023 based on information
obtained from the persons named below, with respect to the beneficial ownership of common stock, by: 

each
person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5 of our outstanding common stock; 

each
of our executive officers and directors that beneficially owns our common stock; and 

all
our executive officers and directors as a group. 

In
the table below, percentage ownership is based on 4,400,795 shares of our common stock, consisting of (i) 4,400,794 shares of our Class
A common stock and (ii) one share of our Class B common stock, issued and outstanding as of March 30, 2023. On all matters to be voted
upon, holders of the shares of Class A common stock and shares of Class B common stock vote together as a single class. Currently, the
one outstanding share of Class B common stock is convertible into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. 

Unless
otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares
of common stock beneficially owned by them. The following table does not reflect record or beneficial ownership of the private placement
warrants as these warrants are not exercisable within 60 days of the date of this Report.

Item
13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. 

On
May 28, 2021, our sponsor purchased 3,750,000 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of 25,000. On December 14, 2021, our sponsor
returned to us, at no cost, an aggregate of 511,250 founder shares, which we cancelled, resulting in an aggregate of 3,238,750 founder
shares outstanding and held by our sponsor. On December 14, 2021, we issued 355,000 founder shares to A.G.P. On January 12, 2022, our
sponsor transferred 176,094 founder shares to George Syllantavos, and 28,750 founder shares to Anastasios Chrysostomidis. The total number
of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such founder shares would represent 20 of the outstanding shares
upon completion of our initial public offering (not including the private placement shares). The founder shares (including the Class
A common stock issuable upon exercise thereof) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the
holder. 

Our
sponsor purchased 653,750 private placement units at a price of 10.00 per unit, for an aggregate purchase price of 6,537,500. The private
placement units are identical to the units sold in our initial public offering except that (a) the private placement units and their
component securities will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the consummation of our initial business combination
except to permitted transferees, (b) the shares of Class A common stock included in the private placement units and underlying the private
placement warrants will be entitled to registration rights and (c) the private placement warrants are entitled to registration rights. 

If
any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an initial business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business
of any entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or
contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such other entity. Our officers and directors currently have
certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. 

43 

We
pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support.
Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. For the year ended December
31, 2022, the Company incurred and paid 105,000 of administrative service fees. For the period from April 13, 2021 (inception) through
December 31, 2021, no administrative service fees were incurred. 

Other
than the foregoing, no compensation of any kind, including any finder s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee or monies in respect
of any payment of a loan, has been or will be paid by us to our sponsor, officers and directors, or any affiliate of our sponsor or officers,
prior to, or in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate the consummation of an initial business combination (regardless
of the type of transaction that it is). However, these individuals are reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations.
Our audit committee reviews on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates
and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement
of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf. 

Prior
to the closing of our initial public offering, our sponsor agreed to loan us up to 300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses
of our initial public offering. This loan was non-interest bearing, unsecured and were due at the earlier of March 31, 2022 or the closing
of our initial public offering. This loan was repaid upon the closing of our initial public offering out of the estimated 660,000 of
offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions). As of February 15,
2022, the Company had borrowed 244,863 under the promissory note and repaid 247,910; the excess of 3,047 was recorded as due from
Sponsor. 

On
February 27, 2023, we issued an aggregate of 3,593,749 shares of Class A common stock to our sponsor, A.G.P., George Syllantavos and
Anastasios Chrysostomidis, the holders of our Class B common stock, upon the conversion of an equal number of shares of Class B common
stock. These shares of Class A common stock are subject to the same restrictions as applied to the Class B common stock before the conversion,
including, among other things, certain transfer restrictions, waiver of redemption rights and the obligation to vote in favor of an initial
business combination as described in the prospectus for our initial public offering. Following the conversion, our sponsor was the beneficial
owner of 3,033,905 shares of our Class A common stock and one share of our Class B common stock. The sponsor then transferred 533,525
shares of Class A common stock to certain members of the sponsor. Subsequent to those transfers, the sponsor holds 2,500,380 shares of
Class A common stock and one share of Class B common stock, as well as 653,750 shares of Class A common stock underlying private placement
units, which units were acquired by the sponsor in connection with the Company s initial public offering. 

In
addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate
of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required as Working Capital
Loans. If we complete an initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination
does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds
from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into private
placement-equivalent units at a price of 10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued 150,000 units
if 1,500,000 of notes were so converted), at the option of the lender. Such units would be identical to the private placement units.
The terms of such Working Capital Loans (or extension loans) by our sponsor or its affiliates, or our officers and directors, if any,
have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other
than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver
against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, no such Working Capital Loans
were outstanding. 

After
our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees
from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender
offer or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, furnished to our stockholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will
be known at the time of distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a stockholder meeting held to consider our initial
business combination, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director
compensation. 

44 

We
have entered into a registration rights agreement with respect to the private placement units and the shares of Class A common stock
and warrants included therein, as well as the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise or conversion or exercise of the
foregoing warrants, and upon conversion of the founder shares. 

Director
Independence 

Nasdaq
listing standards require that a majority of our board of directors be independent. An independent director is defined
generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship
which in the opinion of the company s board of directors, would interfere with the director s exercise of independent judgment
in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our board of directors has determined that John Anthony Quelch, Emily Paxhia and
Francis Knuettel II are independent directors as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our
independent directors have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present. 

Item
14 . Principal Accountant Fees and Services. 

The
following is a summary of fees paid or to be paid to Withum, for services rendered. 

Audit
Fees 

Audit
fees consist of fees for professional services rendered for the audit of our year-end financial statements and services that are normally
provided by Withum in connection with regulatory filings. The aggregate fees of Withum for professional services rendered for the audit
of our annual financial statements, review of the financial information included in our Forms 10-Q for the respective periods and other
required filings with the SEC for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from April 13, 2021 (inception) through December
31, 2021 totaled approximately 80,000 and 29,500, respectively. The aggregate fees of Withum related to audit services in connection
with our initial public offering totaled approximately 54,000. The above amounts include interim procedures and audit fees, as well
as attendance at audit committee meetings. 

Audit-Related
Fees 

Audit-related
fees consist of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to performance of the audit or review of our
financial statements and are not reported under Audit Fees. These services include attest services that are not required
by statute or regulation and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. During the year ended December 31,
2022 and for the period from April 13, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, we did not pay Withum any audit-related fees. 

Tax
Fees 

We
did not pay Withum for tax services, planning or advice for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from April 13, 2021 (inception)
through December 31, 2021. 

All
Other Fees 

We
did not pay Withum for any other services for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from April 13, 2021 (inception) through
December 31, 2021. 

Pre-Approval
Policy 

Our
audit committee was formed upon the consummation of our initial public offering. As a result, the audit committee did not pre-approve
all of the foregoing services, although any services rendered prior to the formation of our audit committee were approved by our board
of directors. Since the formation of our audit committee, and on a going-forward basis, the audit committee has and will pre-approve
all auditing services and permitted non-audit services to be performed for us by our auditors, including the fees and terms thereof (subject
to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in the Exchange Act which are approved by the audit committee prior to
the completion of the audit).

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors
of 

Relativity Acquisition Corp. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of Relativity Acquisition Corp. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, changes
in stockholders deficit and cash flows, for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from April 13, 2021 (inception)
through December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion,
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from April 13, 2021 (inception)
through December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, if the Company
is unable to complete a business combination by August 15, 2023 (absent any extensions of such period, pursuant to the terms described in Note 1), then the Company will cease all operations except for
the purpose of liquidating. The date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and
are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We have served as the Company's auditor since
2021.

upon conversion of loans made to the Company). The Company cannot determine at this time whether a majority of the holders of the Class
B common stock at the time of any future issuance would agree to waive such adjustment to the conversion ratio. They may waive such adjustment
due to (but not limited to) the following: (i) closing conditions which are part of the agreement for the initial Business Combination;
(ii) negotiation with Class A stockholders on structuring an initial Business Combination; or (iii) negotiation with parties providing
financing which would trigger the anti-dilution provisions of the Class B common stock. If such adjustment is not waived, the issuance
would not reduce the percentage ownership of holders of the Class B common stock, but would reduce the percentage ownership of holders
of the Class A common stock. If such adjustment is waived, the issuance would reduce the percentage ownership of holders of both classes
of the Company s common stock. Holders of founder shares may also elect to convert their shares of Class B common stock into an
equal number of shares of Class A common stock, subject to adjustment as provided above, at any time. The term equity-linked securities
