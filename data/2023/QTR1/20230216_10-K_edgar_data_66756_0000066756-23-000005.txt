Part I 

Item 1. Business 
 
 Overview. 
 
 ALLETE is a leader in the nation s clean-energy transformation. Our businesses and dedicated employees deliver sustainable energy solutions that mitigate climate change, build thriving communities, help customers reach their sustainability goals and drive value for shareholders. In 2020, ALLETE s largest business, Minnesota Power, reached a milestone of providing 50 percent renewable energy to its retail and municipal customers in Minnesota, and the Company envisions delivering 100 percent carbon-free energy to customers by 2050 a vision grounded in a steadfast commitment to climate, customers and community through its EnergyForward strategy. ALLETE Clean Energy, our second-largest business, is positioned at the heart of society s clean-energy transformation and owns, operates or is developing more than 1,300 megawatts of wind energy generation across eight states helping some of the largest companies in the country reduce their carbon footprint. 
 
 Minnesota Power s latest IRP, approved by the MPUC in an order dated January 9, 2023, outlines its clean-energy transition plans through 2035. These plans include expanding its renewable energy supply to 70 percent by 2030, achieving coal-free operations at its facilities by 2035, and investing in a resilient and flexible transmission and distribution grid. Minnesota Power has also set a target to achieve an 80 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2035 compared to 2005 levels. As part of these plans, Minnesota Power anticipates adding up to 700 MW of new wind and solar energy resources, and ceasing coal operations at Boswell Units 3 and 4 by 2030 and 2035, respectively. Minnesota Power s plans recognize that advances in technology will play a significant role in completing its transition to carbon-free energy supply, reliably and affordably. 
 
 In recent years, Minnesota Power has transformed its energy supply from more than a 95 percent reliance on coal to become a leader in the nation s clean-energy transformation. Since 2013, the company has closed or converted seven of its nine coal-fired units and added nearly 900 megawatts of renewable energy sources. Additionally, Minnesota Power has been a leader in energy conservation, surpassing the state s conservation goals each year for the past decade. 
 
 On February 7, 2023, the Minnesota Governor signed into law legislation that updates the state s renewable energy standard and requires Minnesota electric utilities to source retail sales with 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2040. The Company is evaluating the law to identify challenges and opportunities it could present. (See Regulated Operations Minnesota Legislation .) 
 
 ALLETE is also committed to earning a financial return that rewards our shareholders, allows for reinvestment in our businesses, and sustains growth. ALLETE is predominately a regulated utility through Minnesota Power, SWL P, and an investment in ATC. ALLETE s strategy is to remain predominately a regulated utility while investing in ALLETE Clean Energy and New Energy and its Corporate and Other businesses to complement its regulated businesses, balance exposure to the utility s industrial customers, and provide potential long-term earnings growth. 
 
 Regulated Operations includes our regulated utilities, Minnesota Power and SWL P, as well as our investment in ATC, a Wisconsin-based regulated utility that owns and maintains electric transmission assets in portions of Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois. Minnesota Power provides regulated utility electric service in northeastern Minnesota to approximately 150,000 retail customers. Minnesota Power also has 14 non-affiliated municipal customers in Minnesota. SWL P is a Wisconsin utility and a wholesale customer of Minnesota Power. SWL P provides regulated utility electric, natural gas and water service in northwestern Wisconsin to approximately 15,000 electric customers, 13,000 natural gas customers and 10,000 water customers. Our regulated utility operations include retail and wholesale activities under the jurisdiction of state and federal regulatory authorities . (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.) 
 
 ALLETE Clean Energy focuses on developing, acquiring, and operating clean and renewable energy projects. ALLETE Clean Energy currently owns and operates, in seven states, more than 1,200 MW of nameplate capacity wind energy generation with a majority contracted under PSAs of various durations. In addition, ALLETE Clean Energy engages in the development of wind energy facilities to operate under long-term PSAs or for sale to others upon completion. ALLETE Clean Energy currently has approximately 100 MW of wind energy facilities under contract to be sold to others.

 Industrial Customers . In 2022, industrial customers represented 52 percent of total regulated utility kWh sales. Our industrial customers are primarily in the taconite mining, paper, pulp and secondary wood products, and pipeline industries. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental responses led to a disruption of economic activity. This disruption resulted in reduced sales and revenue from industrial customers in 2020 as many industrial customers operated at reduced levels or were temporarily closed or idled during 2020. Sales to our industrial customers in 2021 were similar to levels prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022 Cliffs decided to idle all production at its Northshore mine until at least April 2023.

 Six taconite facilities served by Minnesota Power made up approximately 85 percent of 2021 iron ore pellet production in the U.S. according to data from the Minnesota Department of Revenue 2022 Mining Tax Guide. These taconite facilities are owned by Cliffs and USS Corporation. (See Large Power Customer Contracts .) Sales to taconite customers represented 4,713 million kWh, or 70 percent of total industrial customer kWh sales in 2022. Taconite, an iron bearing rock of relatively low iron content, is abundantly available in northern Minnesota and an important domestic source of raw material for the steel industry. Taconite processing plants use large quantities of electric power to grind the iron-bearing rock, and agglomerate and pelletize the iron particles into taconite pellets. 
 
 Minnesota Power s taconite customers are capable of producing approximately 41 million tons of taconite pellets annually. Taconite pellets produced in Minnesota are primarily shipped to North American steel making facilities that are part of the integrated steel industry, which continue to lead the world in environmental performance among steelmaking countries. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, steel production in the U.S. is the most energy efficient of any major steel producing country. Steel produced from these North American facilities is used primarily in the manufacture of automobiles, appliances, tubular applications for all industries, and in the construction industry. Steel is also a critical component of the clean energy transformation underway today. The demand for more renewable energy and the need for additional infrastructure to transport green energy from the point of generation to the end user both require steel. Historically, less than 10 percent of Minnesota taconite production has been exported outside of North America.

REGULATED OPERATIONS (Continued) 
 Industrial Customers (Continued) 
 
 There has been a general historical correlation between U.S. steel production and Minnesota taconite production. The American Iron and Steel Institute, an association of North American steel producers, reported that U.S. raw steel production operated at approximately 78 percent of capacity in 2022 (82 percent in 2021 and 68 percent in 2020). The World Steel Association, an association of steel producers, national and regional steel industry associations, and steel research institutes representing approximately 85 percent of world steel production, projected U.S. steel consumption in 2023 will increase by approximately 2 percent compared to 2022. 
 
 The following table reflects Minnesota Power s taconite customers production levels for the past ten years: 
 Minnesota Power Taconite Customer Production Year Tons (Millions) 2022 32 2021 39 2020 30 2019 37 2018 39 2017 38 2016 28 2015 31 2014 39 2013 37 Source: Minnesota Department of Revenue 2022 Mining Tax Guide for years 2013 - 2021. Preliminary data from the Minnesota Department of Revenue. 
 Minnesota Power s taconite customers may experience annual variations in production levels due to such factors as economic conditions, short-term demand changes or maintenance outages. We estimate that a one million ton change in Minnesota Power s taconite customers production would impact our annual earnings per share by approximately 0.04, net of expected power marketing sales at current prices. Changes in wholesale electric prices or customer contractual demand nominations could impact this estimate. Minnesota Power proactively sells power in the wholesale power markets that is temporarily not required by industrial customers to optimize the value of its generating facilities. Long-term reductions in taconite production or a permanent shut down of a taconite customer may lead Minnesota Power to file a general rate case to recover lost revenue. 
 
 In addition to serving the taconite industry, Minnesota Power serves a number of customers in the paper, pulp and secondary wood products industry, which represented 735 million kWh, or 11 percent of total industrial customer kWh sales in 2022. Minnesota Power also has an agreement to provide steam for one paper and pulp customer for use in the customer s operations. The major paper and pulp mills we serve reported operating at similar levels in 2022 compared to 2021. Verso Corporation indefinitely idled its paper mill in Duluth, Minnesota, which it subsequently sold to ST Paper in May 2021. (See Outlook Regulated Operations Industrial Customers and Prospective Additional Load Paper, Pulp and Secondary Wood Products ST Paper.) 
 
 Large Power Customer Contracts. Minnesota Power had seven Large Power Customer contracts as of December 31, 2022, each serving requirements of 10 MW or more of customer load. The customers as of December 31, 2022 consisted of six taconite facilities owned by Cliffs and USS Corporation as well as three paper and pulp mills. Certain facilities with common ownership are served under combined contracts.

REGULATED OPERATIONS (Continued) 
 Large Power Customer Contracts (Continued) 
 
 Large Power Customer contracts require Minnesota Power to have a certain amount of generating capacity available. In turn, each Large Power Customer is required to pay a minimum monthly demand charge that covers the fixed costs associated with having this capacity available to serve the customer, including a return on common equity. Most contracts allow customers to establish the level of megawatts subject to a demand charge on a three- to four-month basis and require that a portion of their megawatt needs be committed on a take-or-pay basis for at least a portion of the term of the agreement. In addition to the demand charge, each Large Power Customer is billed an energy charge for each kWh used that recovers the variable costs incurred in generating electricity. Five of the Large Power Customer contracts have interruptible service which provides a discounted demand rate in exchange for the ability to interrupt the customers during system emergencies. Minnesota Power also provides incremental production service for customer demand levels above the contractual take-or-pay levels. There is no demand charge for this service and energy is priced at an increment above Minnesota Power s cost. Incremental production service is interruptible. 
 
 All contracts with Large Power Customers continue past the contract termination date unless the required advance notice of cancellation has been given. The required advance notice of cancellation varies from two to four years. Such contracts reduce the impact on earnings that otherwise would result from significant reductions in kWh sales to such customers. Large Power Customers are required to take all of their purchased electric service requirements from Minnesota Power for the duration of their contracts. The rates and corresponding revenue associated with capacity and energy provided under these contracts are subject to change through the same regulatory process governing all retail electric rates. (See Regulatory Matters Electric Rates .) 
 
 Minnesota Power, as permitted by the MPUC, requires its taconite-producing Large Power Customers to pay weekly for electric usage based on monthly energy usage estimates. These customers receive estimated bills or make weekly prepayments based on Minnesota Power s estimate of the customer s energy usage, forecasted energy prices and fuel adjustment clause estimates. Minnesota Power s taconite producing Large Power Customers have generally predictable energy usage on a week-to-week basis and any differences that occur are trued-up the following month.

 Residential and Commercial Customers. In 2022, residential and commercial customers represented 20 percent of total regulated utility kWh sales. 
 
 Municipal Customers. In 2022, municipal customers represented 4 percent of total regulated utility kWh sales. 
 
 Minnesota Power s wholesale electric contracts with 14 non-affiliated municipal customers in Minnesota have termination dates ranging from 2029 through 2037, with a majority of contracts expiring in 2029. One of these wholesale contracts includes a termination clause requiring a three-year notice to terminate. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.) 
 
 Other Power Suppliers. The Company also enters into off-system sales with Other Power Suppliers. These sales are at market based prices into the MISO market on a daily basis or through bilateral agreements of various durations. 
 
 Our PSAs are detailed in Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies, with additional disclosure provided in the following paragraphs. 
 
 Minnkota Power PSA. Minnesota Power has a PSA with Minnkota Power where Minnesota Power is selling a portion of its entitlement from Square Butte to Minnkota Power, resulting in Minnkota Power s net entitlement increasing and Minnesota Power s net entitlement decreasing until Minnesota Power s share is eliminated at the end of 2025. Of Minnesota Power s 50 percent output entitlement, it sold approximately 32 percent to Minnkota Power in 2022 (28 percent in 2021 and in 2020). Minnkota Power s net entitlement increases to approximately 37 percent in 2023, 41 percent in 2024, 46 percent in 2025 and 50 percent in 2026. (See Power Supply Long-Term Purchased Power .) 
 
 Silver Bay Power PSA . Minnesota Power has a PSA with Silver Bay Power through 2031 to supply the full energy requirements for Silver Bay Power. Silver Bay Power supplies approximately 90 MW of load to Northshore Mining, an affiliate of Silver Bay Power. 
 
 Hibbing Public Utilities . In April 2022, Minnesota Power entered into a new long-term Power Purchase and Market Energy Service Agreement with Hibbing Public Utilities for the period of June 1, 2022, through May 31, 2027. The agreement replaced the previous wholesale electric contract between Hibbing Public Utilities and Minnesota Power. 

Seasonality 
 
 The operations of our industrial customers, which make up a large portion of our electric sales, are not typically subject to significant seasonal variations. (See Electric Sales / Customers. As a result, Minnesota Power is generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations in electric sales; however, Minnesota Power and SWL P electric and natural gas sales to other customers may be affected by seasonal differences in weather. In general, peak electric sales occur in the winter and summer months with fewer electric sales in the spring and fall months. Peak sales of natural gas generally occur in the winter months. Additionally, our regulated utilities have historically generated fewer sales and less revenue when weather conditions are milder in the winter and summer. 

Power Supply 
 
 In order to meet its customers electric requirements, Minnesota Power utilizes a mix of its own generation and purchased power. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 50 percent of Minnesota Power s power supply for its retail and municipal customers in Minnesota was provided by renewable energy sources. This was enabled by the completion of the 250 MW Nobles 2 wind energy facility in December 2020 and the GNTL in June 2020, which is used to deliver 250 MW of hydroelectric energy from Manitoba Hydro. Minnesota Power s remaining operating coal-fired facilities are Boswell Units 3 and 4, which Minnesota Power plans to cease coal operations at by 2030 and 2035, respectively. (See Regulatory Matters .) The following table reflects Minnesota Power s generating capabilities as of December 31, 2022, and total electrical supply for 2022. Minnesota Power had an annual net peak load of 1,556 MW on January 7, 2022.

 Power Supply (Continued) 
 
 Fuel . Minnesota Power purchases low-sulfur, sub-bituminous coal from the Powder River Basin region located in Montana and Wyoming. Coal consumption in 2022 for electric generation at Minnesota Power s coal-fired generating stations was 2.7 million tons (2.7 million tons in 2021; 2.2 million tons in 2020). As of December 31, 2022, Minnesota Power had coal inventories of 0.8 million tons (0.4 million tons as of December 31, 2021). Minnesota Power has coal supply agreements providing for the purchase of a significant portion of its coal requirements through December 2023. In 2023, Minnesota Power expects to obtain coal under these coal supply agreements and in the spot market. Minnesota Power continues to explore other future coal supply options and believes that adequate supplies of low-sulfur, sub-bituminous coal will continue to be available. 
 
 Minnesota Power also has coal transportation agreements in place for the delivery of a significant portion of its coal requirements through December 2024. The costs of fuel and related transportation costs for Minnesota Power s generation are recoverable from Minnesota Power s utility customers through the fuel adjustment clause.

 Long-Term Purchased Power . Minnesota Power has contracts to purchase capacity and energy from various entities, including output from certain coal, wind, hydro and solar generating facilities. 
 
 Our PPAs are detailed in Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies, with additional disclosure provided in the following paragraph. 
 
 Square Butte PPA. Under the PPA with Square Butte that extends through 2026, Minnesota Power is entitled to 50 percent of the output of Square Butte s 455 MW coal-fired generating unit. (See Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.) BNI Energy mines and sells lignite coal to Square Butte. This lignite supply is sufficient to provide fuel for the anticipated useful life of the generating unit. Square Butte s cost of lignite consumed in 2022 was approximately 2.05 per MBtu 1.94 per MBtu in 2021; 1.75 per MBtu in 2020). (See Electric Sales / Customers Minnkota Power PSA .) 
 
 Manitoba Hydro. Minnesota Power has two long-term PPAs with Manitoba Hydro. The first PPA provides for Minnesota Power to purchase 250 MW of capacity and energy from Manitoba Hydro through May 2035. The second PPA provides for Minnesota Power to purchase up to 133 MW of energy from Manitoba Hydro through June 2040. A third PPA, which expired in April 2022 was an energy-only agreement, which primarily consisted of surplus hydro energy on Manitoba Hydro s system that was delivered to Minnesota Power on a non-firm basis. 

Transmission and Distribution 
 
 We have electric transmission and distribution lines of 500 kV (232 miles), 345 kV (241 miles), 250 kV (466 miles), 230 kV (715 miles), 161 kV (43 miles), 138 kV (8 miles), 115 kV (1,376 miles) and less than 115 kV (6,416 miles). We own and operate 162 substations with a total capacity of 10,116 megavoltamperes. Some of our transmission and distribution lines interconnect with other utilities. 
 
 Great Northern Transmission Line. As a condition of the 250 MW long-term PPA entered into with Manitoba Hydro, construction of additional transmission capacity was required. As a result, Minnesota Power constructed the GNTL, an approximately 220 mile 500-kV transmission line between Manitoba and Minnesota s Iron Range that was proposed by Minnesota Power and Manitoba Hydro in order to strengthen the electric grid, enhance regional reliability and promote a greater exchange of sustainable energy. In June 2020, Minnesota Power placed the GNTL into service with project costs of approximately 310 million incurred by Minnesota Power. Total project costs, including those costs contributed by a subsidiary of Manitoba Hydro, totaled approximately 660 million. The 250 MW PPA with Manitoba Hydro commenced when the GNTL was placed into service.

 Investment in ATC 
 
 Our wholly-owned subsidiary, ALLETE Transmission Holdings, owns approximately 8 percent of ATC, a Wisconsin-based utility that owns and maintains electric transmission assets in portions of Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois. We account for our investment in ATC under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2022, our equity investment in ATC was 165.4 million 154.5 million as of December 31, 2021). (See Note 6. Equity Investments.) 
 
 ATC s authorized return on equity is 10.02 percent, or 10.52 percent including an incentive adder for participation in a regional transmission organization, based on a 2020 FERC order which is subject to various outstanding legal challenges related to the return on equity calculation and refund period ordered by the FERC. On August 9, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated and remanded the 2020 FERC order back to the FERC. As a result of this decision, ATC recorded a reserve in the third quarter of 2022 for anticipated refunds to its customers for approximately 31 million of which our share was approximately 2.4 million pre-tax. We cannot predict the return on equity the FERC will ultimately authorize in the remanded proceeding. 
 
 In addition, the FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in April 2021 proposing to limit the 50 basis point incentive adder for participation in a regional transmission organization to only the first three years of membership in such an organization. If this proposal is adopted, our equity in earnings from ATC would be reduced by approximately 1 million pre-tax annually. 
 
 ATC s most recent 10-year transmission assessment, which covers the years 2022 through 2031, identifies a need for between 5.1 billion and 6.2 billion in transmission system investments. These investments by ATC, if undertaken, are expected to be funded through a combination of internally generated cash, debt and investor contributions. As opportunities arise, we plan to make additional investments in ATC through general capital calls based upon our pro rata ownership interest in ATC. 

Properties 
 
 Our Regulated Operations businesses own office and service buildings, an energy control center, repair shops, electric plants, transmission facilities and storerooms in various localities in Minnesota, Wisconsin and North Dakota. All of the electric plants are subject to mortgages, which collateralize the outstanding first mortgage bonds of Minnesota Power and SWL P. Most of the generating plants and substations are located on real property owned by Minnesota Power or SWL P, subject to the lien of a mortgage, whereas most of the transmission and distribution lines are located on real property owned by others with appropriate easement rights or necessary permits from governmental authorities. WPPI Energy owns 20 percent of Boswell Unit 4. WPPI Energy has the right to use our transmission line facilities to transport its share of Boswell generation. (See Note 3. Jointly-Owned Facilities and Assets.) 

Regulatory Matters 
 
 We are subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory authorities and other organizations. Regulatory matters and proceedings are detailed in Note 4. Regulatory Matters, with a summary included in the following paragraphs. 
 
 Electric Rates. All rates and contract terms in our Regulated Operations are subject to approval by applicable regulatory authorities. Minnesota Power and SWL P design their retail electric service rates based on cost of service studies under which allocations are made to the various classes of customers as approved by the MPUC or the PSCW. Nearly all retail sales include billing adjustment clauses, which may adjust electric service rates for changes in the cost of fuel and purchased energy, recovery of current and deferred conservation improvement program expenditures and recovery of certain transmission, renewable and environmental investments. 
 
 Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. The MPUC has regulatory authority over Minnesota Power s retail service area in Minnesota, retail rates, retail services, capital structure, issuance of securities and other matters. Minnesota Power s current retail rates through 2021 were based on a 2018 MPUC retail rate order that allows for a 9.25 percent return on common equity and a 53.81 percent equity ratio. The resolution of Minnesota Power s 2020 general rate case did not change the allowed return on equity or equity ratio. (See 2020 Minnesota General Rate Case .) As authorized by the MPUC, Minnesota Power also recognizes revenue under cost recovery riders for transmission and renewable investments.

REGULATED OPERATIONS (Continued) 
 Regulatory Matters (Continued) 
 
 2020 Minnesota General Rate Case. In November 2019, Minnesota Power filed a retail rate increase request with the MPUC seeking an average increase of approximately 10.6 percent for retail customers. 
 
 In April 2020, Minnesota Power filed a request with the MPUC that proposed a resolution of Minnesota Power s 2020 general rate case. Key components of our proposal included removing the power marketing margin credit in base rates and reflecting actual power marketing margins in the fuel adjustment clause effective May 1, 2020; refunding to customers interim rates collected through April 2020; increasing customer rates 4.1 percent compared to the 5.8 percent increase reflected in interim rates; and a provision that Minnesota Power would not file another rate case until at least November 1, 2021, unless certain events occur. In a June 2020 order, the MPUC approved Minnesota Power s petition and proposal to resolve and withdraw the general rate case. Effective May 1, 2020, customer rates were set at an increase of 4.1 percent with the removal of the power marketing margin credit from base rates. Actual power marketing margins are now reflected in the fuel adjustment clause. Reserves for interim rates of 11.7 million were recorded in the second quarter of 2020 and refunded in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. 
 
 2022 Minnesota General Rate Case . On November 1, 2021, Minnesota Power filed a retail rate increase request with the MPUC seeking an average increase of approximately 18 percent for retail customers. The rate filing seeks a return on equity of 10.25 percent and a 53.81 percent equity ratio. On an annualized basis, the requested final rate increase would generate approximately 108 million in additional revenue. In orders dated December 30, 2021, the MPUC accepted the filing as complete and authorized an annual interim rate increase beginning January 1, 2022, with approximately 80 million expected to be collected in cash and approximately 8 million of interim rates for residential customers deferred with a final determination on recovery at the end of the rate case. 
 
 At a hearing on January 23, 2023, the MPUC made determinations regarding Minnesota Power s general rate case including allowing a return on common equity of 9.65 percent and a 52.50 percent equity ratio. Upon commencement of final rates, we expect additional revenue from base rates of approximately 60 million and an additional 10 million in revenue recognized under cost recovery riders on an annualized basis, subject to final written order and reconsideration. Final rates are expected to commence in the third quarter of 2023; interim rates will be collected through this period with reserves recorded as necessary. As a result of the MPUC s determinations made on January 23, 2023, Minnesota Power has recorded a reserve for an interim rate refund of approximately 18 million pre-tax as of December 31, 2022, which is subject to MPUC approval of Minnesota Power s refund calculation. In addition, Minnesota Power recorded a charge of approximately 8 million pre-tax to write-off the deferred portion of residential customer interim rates. Minnesota Power also recorded additional revenue of approximately 9 million pre-tax for an increase in expected recoveries under its cost recovery riders. 
 
 Minnesota Power Land Sales . In August 2020, Minnesota Power filed a petition with the MPUC for approval to sell land that surrounds several reservoirs on its hydroelectric system and is no longer required to maintain its operations. The land has an estimated value of approximately 100 million, and Minnesota Power proposed to credit ratepayers the net proceeds from the sales in a future rate case or through its renewable resources rider to mitigate future rate increases. In an order dated November 18, 2021, the MPUC authorized the land sales and directed the net proceeds to be refunded to ratepayers subject to certain conditions and required compliance filings. 
 
 2021 Integrated Resource Plan. On February 1, 2021, Minnesota Power filed its latest IRP, which was approved by the MPUC in an order dated January 9, 2023. The approved IRP, which reflects a joint agreement reached with various stakeholders, outlines Minnesota Power s clean-energy transition plans through 2035. These plans include expanding its renewable energy supply, achieving coal-free operations at its facilities by 2035, and investing in a resilient and flexible transmission and distribution grid. As part of these plans, Minnesota Power anticipates adding up to 700 MW of new wind and solar energy resources, and ceasing coal operations at Boswell Units 3 and 4 by 2030 and 2035, respectively. Minnesota Power s plans recognize that advances in technology will play a significant role in completing its transition to carbon-free energy supply, reliably and affordably. Minnesota Power is expected to file its next IRP by March 1, 2025. 
 
 Minnesota Power has a vision to deliver 100 percent carbon-free energy to customers by 2050, continuing its commitment to climate, customers and communities through its EnergyForward strategy. This vision builds on Minnesota Power s achievement, in 2020, of now providing 50 percent renewable energy to its customers.

REGULATED OPERATIONS (Continued) 
 Regulatory Matters (Continued) 
 
 Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. The PSCW has regulatory authority over SWL P s retail sales of electricity, natural gas and water, issuances of securities and other matters. SWL P s retail rates through 2022 were based on a December 2018 order by the PSCW that allowed for a return on equity of 10.4 percent and a 55.0 percent equity ratio. 
 
 In 2022, SWL P filed a rate increase request with the PSCW seeking an average increase of 3.6 percent for retail customers. The filing sought an overall return on equity of 10.4 percent and a 55 percent equity ratio. On an annualized basis, the requested final rate increase would have generated an estimated 4.3 million in additional revenue. In an order dated December 20, 2022, the PSCW approved an annual increase of 3.3 million reflecting a return on equity of 10.0 percent and 55 percent equity ratio. Final rates went into effect January 1, 2023. 
 
 North Dakota Public Service Commission. The NDPSC has jurisdiction over site and route permitting of generation and transmission facilities in North Dakota. 
 
 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The FERC has jurisdiction over the licensing of hydroelectric projects, the establishment of rates and charges for transmission of electricity in interstate commerce, electricity sold at wholesale (including the rates for Minnesota Power s municipal and wholesale customers), natural gas transportation, certain accounting and record keeping practices, certain activities of our regulated utilities and the operations of ATC. FERC jurisdiction also includes enforcement of NERC mandatory electric reliability standards. Violations of FERC rules are subject to enforcement action by the FERC including financial penalties up to 1 million per day per violation. 

Regional Organizations 
 
 Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. Minnesota Power, SWL P and ATC are members of MISO, a regional transmission organization. While Minnesota Power and SWL P retain ownership of their respective transmission assets, their transmission networks are under the regional operational control of MISO. Minnesota Power and SWL P take and provide transmission service under the MISO open access transmission tariff. In cooperation with stakeholders, MISO manages the delivery of electric power across 15 states and the Canadian province of Manitoba. 
 
 North American Electric Reliability Corporation. The NERC has been certified by the FERC as the national electric reliability organization. The NERC ensures the reliability of the North American bulk power system. The NERC oversees six regional entities that establish requirements, approved by the FERC, for reliable operation and maintenance of power generation facilities and transmission systems. Minnesota Power is subject to these reliability requirements and can incur significant penalties for non compliance. 
 
 Midwest Reliability Organization (MRO). Minnesota Power and ATC are members of the MRO, one of the six regional entities overseen by the NERC. The MRO's primary responsibilities are to: ensure compliance with mandatory reliability standards by entities which own, operate or use the interconnected, international bulk power system; conduct assessments of the grid's ability to meet electricity demand in the region; and analyze regional system events. The MRO region spans the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and all or parts of 16 states. 

Minnesota Legislation 
 
 Renewable and Carbon-Free Energy Requirements. On February 7, 2023, the Minnesota Governor signed into law legislation that updates the state s renewable energy standard and requires Minnesota electric utilities to source retail sales with 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2040. The law increases the renewable energy standard from 25 percent renewable by 2025 to 55 percent renewable by 2035, and requires investor-owned Minnesota utilities to provide 80 percent carbon-free energy by 2030, 90 percent carbon-free energy by 2035 and 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2040. The law utilizes renewable energy credits as the means to demonstrate compliance with both the carbon-free and renewable energy standards, includes an off ramp provision that enables the MPUC to protect reliability and customer costs through modification or delay of either the renewable energy standard, the carbon-free standard, or both, and streamlines development and construction of wind energy projects and transmission in Minnesota. The Company is evaluating the law to identify challenges and opportunities it could present. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, approximately 50 percent of Minnesota Power s power supply for its retail and municipal customers in Minnesota was provided by renewable energy sources. Minnesota Power s plans include expanding its renewable energy supply to 70 percent renewable energy by 2030. (See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Outlook EnergyForward.) 
 ALLETE, Inc. 2022 Form 10-K

REGULATED OPERATIONS (Continued) 
 Minnesota Legislation (Continued) 
 
 Minnesota Solar Energy Standard. Minnesota law requires at least 1.5 percent of total retail electric sales, excluding sales to certain customers, to be generated by solar energy. At least 10 percent of the 1.5 percent mandate must be met by solar energy generated by or procured from solar photovoltaic devices with a nameplate capacity of 40 kW or less and community solar garden subscriptions. Minnesota Power has met both parts of the solar mandate to date. 

Competition 
 
 Retail electric energy sales in Minnesota and Wisconsin are made to customers in assigned service territories. As a result, most retail electric customers in Minnesota do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier. Large energy users of 2 MW and above that are located outside of a municipality are allowed to choose a supplier upon MPUC approval. Minnesota Power served seven Large Power Customers under contracts of at least 10 MW in 2022, none of which have engaged in a competitive rate process. (See Electric Sales / Customers. No other large commercial or small industrial customers in Minnesota Power s service territory have sought a provider outside Minnesota Power s service territory. Retail electric and natural gas customers in Wisconsin do not have the ability to choose their energy supplier. In both states, however, electricity may compete with other forms of energy. Customers may also choose to generate their own electricity, or substitute other forms of energy for their manufacturing processes. 
 
 In 2022, 4 percent of total regulated utility kWh sales were to municipal customers in Minnesota. These customers have the right to seek an energy supply from any wholesale electric service provider upon contract expiration. Minnesota Power s wholesale electric contract with the Nashwauk Public Utilities Commission was extended in 2020 and is effective through December 31, 2037. Minnesota Power s wholesale electric contracts with 13 other non-affiliated municipal customers are effective through 2029. (See Electric Sales / Customers. 
 
 The FERC has continued with its efforts to promote a competitive wholesale market through open-access electric transmission and other means. As a result, our electric sales to Other Power Suppliers and our purchases to supply our retail and wholesale load are made in a competitive market. 

Franchises 
 
 Minnesota Power holds franchises to construct and maintain an electric distribution and transmission system in 95 cities. The remaining cities, villages and towns served by Minnesota Power do not require a franchise to operate. SWL P serves customers under electric, natural gas or water franchises in 1 city and 14 villages and towns. 

ALLETE CLEAN ENERGY 
 
 ALLETE Clean Energy focuses on developing, acquiring, and operating clean and renewable energy projects. ALLETE Clean Energy currently owns and operates, in seven states, more than 1,200 MW of nameplate capacity wind energy generation with a majority contracted under PSAs of various durations. In addition, ALLETE Clean Energy engages in the development of wind energy facilities to operate under long-term PSAs or for sale to others upon completion. ALLETE Clean Energy currently has approximately 100 MW of wind energy facilities under contract to be sold to others. (See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Outlook ALLETE Clean Energy.) 
 
 ALLETE Clean Energy believes the market for renewable energy in North America is robust, driven by several factors including environmental regulation, tax incentives such as the extension of production tax credit and investment tax credits, societal expectations and continual technology advances. State renewable portfolio standards, state or federal regulations to limit GHG emissions and the extension of production tax credit and investment tax credits are examples of environmental regulation or public policy that we believe will drive renewable energy development.

ALLETE CLEAN ENERGY (Continued) 
 
 ALLETE Clean Energy s strategy includes the safe, reliable, optimal and profitable operation of its existing facilities. This includes a strong safety culture, the continuous pursuit of operational efficiencies at existing facilities and cost controls. ALLETE Clean Energy generally acquires facilities in liquid power markets and its strategy includes the exploration of PSA extensions upon expiration of existing contracts, production tax credit requalification of existing facilities or the sale of facilities. 
 
 ALLETE Clean Energy manages risk by having a diverse portfolio of assets, which includes PSA expiration, technology and geographic diversity. The current operating portfolio is subject to typical variations in seasonal wind with higher wind resources typically available in the winter months. The majority of its planned maintenance leverages this seasonality and is performed during lower wind periods. ALLETE Clean Energy s current operating portfolio is as follows: 
 
 Region Wind Energy Facility Capacity MW PSA MW PSA Expiration East Armenia Mountain 101 100 2024 Midwest Lake Benton 104 100 2028 Storm Lake I 108 100 2027 Storm Lake II 77 Merchant 90 n/a PSA 10 2032 Other 17 100 2028 South Caddo 303 Merchant 27 n/a PSA 1 66 2034 PSA 2 7 2034 Diamond Spring 303 PSA 1 58 2035 PSA 2 25 2032 PSA 3 16 2035 West Condon 50 100 (a) Glen Ullin 106 100 2039 South Peak 80 100 2035 
 (a) The PSA for Condon expired in 2022, and Condon is currently selling energy pursuant to a month-to-month agreement while the parties negotiate an agreement on a new PSA. 
 
 The majority of ALLETE Clean Energy s wind operations are located on real property owned by others with easement rights or necessary consents of governmental authorities. One of ALLETE Clean Energy s wind energy facilities is encumbered by liens against its assets securing financing. ALLETE Clean Energy s Glen Ullin, South Peak, Diamond Spring and Caddo wind energy facilities are subject to tax equity financing structures. (See Note 1. Operations and Significant Accounting Policies.)

 Our subsidiary, ALLETE South Wind, owns a 49 percent equity interest in Nobles 2, the entity that owns and operates a 250 MW wind energy facility in southwestern Minnesota pursuant to a 20-year PPA with Minnesota Power. As of December 31, 2022, our equity investment in Nobles 2 was 157.3 million 163.5 million at December 31, 2021). (See Note 6. Equity Investments.) 

South Shore Energy 
 
 South Shore Energy, ALLETE s non-rate regulated, Wisconsin subsidiary, is developing NTEC, an approximately 600 MW proposed combined-cycle natural gas-fired generating facility to be built in Superior, Wisconsin, which will be jointly owned by Dairyland Power Cooperative, Basin and South Shore Energy. Minnesota Power is expected to purchase approximately 20 percent of the facility's output starting in 2027 pursuant to a capacity dedication agreement. Construction of NTEC is subject to obtaining additional permits from local, state and federal authorities. The total project cost is estimated to be approximately 700 million, of which South Shore Energy s portion is expected to be approximately 150 million. South Shore Energy s portion of NTEC project costs incurred through December 31, 2022, is approximately 7 million. 

BNI Energy 
 
 BNI Energy is a supplier of lignite coal in North Dakota, producing approximately 4 million tons annually and has an estimated 650 million tons of lignite coal reserves. Two electric generating cooperatives, Minnkota Power and Square Butte, consume virtually all of BNI Energy s production of lignite under cost-plus fixed fee coal supply agreements extending through December 31, 2037. (See Item 1. Business Regulated Operations Power Supply Long-Term Purchased Power and Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.) The mining process disturbs and reclaims between 200 and 250 acres per year. Laws require that the reclaimed land be at least as productive as it was prior to mining. As of December 31, 2022, BNI Energy s total reclamation liability is estimated at million, which is included in Other Non-Current Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at its present value. These costs are included in the cost-plus fixed fee contract, for which an asset reclamation cost receivable was included in Other Non-Current Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The asset reclamation obligation is guaranteed by surety bonds and a letter of credit. (See Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.) 

ALLETE Properties 
 
 ALLETE Properties represents our legacy Florida real estate investment. ALLETE Properties major project in Florida is Town Center at Palm Coast, which consists of approximately 300 acres of land as well as various residential units and non-residential square footage. In addition to the Town Center at Palm Coast project, ALLETE Properties has approximately 500 acres of other land available for sale. (See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Outlook Corporate and Other ALLETE Properties.) 
 
 Seller Financing. ALLETE Properties occasionally provides seller financing to qualified buyers. As of December 31, 2022, outstanding finance receivables were 10.5 million, net of reserves, with maturities through 2027. These finance receivables accrue interest at market-based rates and are collateralized by the financed properties. 
 
 Regulation. A substantial portion of our development properties in Florida are subject to federal, state and local regulations, and restrictions that may impose significant costs or limitations on our ability to develop the properties. Much of our property is vacant land and some is located in areas where development may affect the natural habitats of various protected wildlife species or in sensitive environmental areas such as wetlands. 

Non-Rate Base Generation and Miscellaneous 
 
 Corporate and Other also includes other business development and corporate expenditures, unallocated interest expense, a small amount of non-rate base generation, land holdings in Minnesota, and earnings on cash and investments. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, non-rate base generation consists of 29 MW of natural gas and hydro generation at Rapids Energy Center in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, which is primarily dedicated to the needs of one customer, UPM Blandin.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
 
 Our businesses are subject to regulation of environmental matters by various federal, state and local authorities. A number of regulatory changes to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and various waste management requirements have been promulgated by both the EPA and state authorities over the past several years. Minnesota Power s facilities are subject to additional requirements under many of these regulations. Minnesota Power is reshaping its generation portfolio, over time, to reduce its reliance on coal, has installed cost-effective emission control technology, and advocates for sound science and policy during rulemaking implementation. 
 
 We consider our businesses to be in substantial compliance with currently applicable environmental regulations and believe all necessary permits have been obtained. We anticipate that with many state and federal environmental regulations and requirements finalized, or to be finalized in the near future, potential expenditures for future environmental matters may be material and require significant capital investments. Minnesota Power has evaluated various environmental compliance scenarios using possible outcomes of environmental regulations to project power supply trends and impacts on customers. 
 
 We review environmental matters on a quarterly basis. Accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies. Accruals are adjusted as assessment and remediation efforts progress, or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. Accruals for environmental liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at undiscounted amounts and exclude claims for recoveries from insurance or other third parties. Costs related to environmental contamination treatment and cleanup are expensed unless recoverable in rates from customers. (See Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.) 

HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
 
 The Company s key human capital management objectives are to attract, recognize and retain high quality talent, align with strategic business objectives and support the Company s values. To support these objectives, the Company s programs are designed to develop talent; reward and support employees through competitive compensation programs and benefit plans; enhance the Company s culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging, safe and inclusive; and acquire talent and leverage internal opportunities to create a high-performing, diverse workforce. Our management, the ALLETE Board of Directors Executive Compensation and Human Capital Committee, and our Board of Directors as a whole play key roles in reviewing and overseeing our human capital practices. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, ALLETE had 1,494 employees, of which 1,467 were full-time. We also respect employees freedom of association and their right to collectively organize. As of December 31, 2022, Minnesota Power and SWL P have an aggregate of 484 employees covered under collective bargaining agreements, of which most are members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 31. The current labor agreements with IBEW Local 31 expire on April 30, 2023 for Minnesota Power and January 31, 2024 for SWL P. BNI Energy has 127 employees that are members of IBEW Local 1593. The current labor agreement with IBEW Local 1593 expires on March 31, 2023. 
 
 ALLETE s Human Rights Statement confirms our commitment to the advancement and protection of human rights, consistent with U.S. human rights laws and the general principles in the International Labour Organization Conventions. 
 
 Integrity . Integrity is a foundational, shared value at ALLETE, is important to ALLETE s business and operations, and enables our success. The Company has a written Code of Business Conduct that applies to all of our employees, directors of ALLETE, contractors, vendors, and others who do business with or on behalf of ALLETE. 
 
 Health and Safety . The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Our journey to Zero Injury starts with a culture that is open and transparent. We encourage all employees to report injuries, near misses, and good catches, so that we can learn and share with others throughout the Company in an effort to improve safety performance. Leaders have regular safety conversations with employees, where hazard identification and controls are discussed to ensure work is being performed safely. Conversations are documented and the data is collected and analyzed for trends. To monitor progress, the Company uses leading and lagging indicators to analyze injury trends, safety participation and other data to make better decision on safety practices.

HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT (Continued) 
 
 Talent Attraction, Retention and Development. For more than a century, ALLETE has been successful because of our ability to attract and retain high-quality people who demonstrate our shared values. We engage in workforce planning, and succession planning, while building a robust talent pipeline and monitoring turnover. 
 
 We recognize and support the growth and development of our employees and offer opportunities to participate in internal and external learning programs. Our internal talent development programs provide employees with the resources they need to develop proficiency in their role, help achieve their career goals and build leadership skills. We are focusing initiatives on programs to expand the diversity of new hires and updating on-the-job trainings including apprenticeships and scholarships aimed at bridging opportunity gaps as we recognize the importance of a strong talent pipeline. In addition to role specific training, targeted training also includes respect in the workplace, cyber awareness, safety, integrity and leadership development. 
 
 Compensation and Benefits. Our competitive compensation package gives employees flexibility, choices and opportunities. Competitive compensation is important for the Company to attract and retain a qualified workforce to successfully manage our business and achieve our business objectives. We also strive to ensure pay equity amongst diverse employees performing equal or substantially similar work. Periodically, we review the median pay of our male and female employees as well as employees from diverse backgrounds. 
 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion . Increasing diversity enriches our workforce culture at ALLETE. Our employees are operating in an increasingly diverse society. In order to be accountable to our employees and stakeholders, we strive to have a workforce that reflects the diversity of the communities we serve, promotes inclusivity and is equitable. 
 
 At ALLETE, we want to ensure that we have a workplace culture where we treat each other with fairness, dignity and respect. The Company has a respect in the workplace initiative, which includes education as well as ongoing discussions focused on building respectful relationships and managing bias. We continue our efforts in crafting a framework to strengthen ALLETE s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the areas of: workforce, supply chain, communications, customers, and ALLETE as a community citizen. ALLETE continues to take tangible steps toward advancing diversity, equity and inclusion by continuing to raise awareness, furthering intentional external relationships/partnerships, increasing supplier diversity, focus on underrepresented groups through grants/scholarships and other Company and employee giving. 
 
 Yellow Ribbon Program . ALLETE and its subsidiaries are dedicated to supporting veterans, military members and their families. An employee effort grew out of that spirit of commitment to veterans and led the state of Minnesota to designate ALLETE/Minnesota Power and ALLETE Clean Energy as Yellow Ribbon Companies. The mission of ALLETE s Yellow Ribbon Program is to contribute to the Company s unique culture by proactively recruiting and retaining the best and supporting an environment in which military-connected employees can thrive.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 The risks and uncertainties discussed below could materially affect our business operations, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and should be carefully considered by stakeholders. The risks and uncertainties in this section are not the only ones we face; additional risks and uncertainties that we are not presently aware of, or that we currently consider immaterial, may also affect our business operations, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Accordingly, the risks described below should be carefully considered together with other information set forth in this report and in future reports that we file with the SEC. 
 
 Regulated Operations Risks 
 
 Our results of operations could be negatively impacted if our taconite, paper and pipeline customers experience an economic downturn, incur work stoppages, fail to compete effectively, experience decreased demand, fail to economically obtain raw materials, fail to renew or obtain necessary permits, or experience a decline in prices for their product. 
 
 Minnesota Power s Large Power Customers (see Item 1. Business Regulated Operations Electric Sales / Customers) and Silver Bay Power accounted for 29 percent of our 2022 consolidated operating revenue (32 percent in 2021 and 29 percent in 2020) and 36 percent of Regulated Operations operating revenue (37 percent in 2021 and 34 percent in 2020). Minnesota Power s taconite customers, which are currently owned by only two entities at the end of 2022, accounted for approximately 26 percent of consolidated operating revenue and 32 percent of Regulated Operations operating revenue in 2022. These customers are involved in cyclical industries that by their nature are adversely impacted by economic downturns and are subject to strong competition in the marketplace. The North American paper and pulp industry also faces declining demand due to the impact of electronic substitution for print and changing customer needs. As a result, certain paper and pulp customers have reduced their existing operations or idled facilities in recent years and have pursued or are pursuing product changes in response to declining demand. Additionally, the taconite industry could be impacted by changing technology in the steel industry such as the adoption of electric arc furnaces for steelmaking, which could result in declining demand for taconite and the electricity used during its production. 
 
 Minnesota Power also serves two pipeline customers that accounted for 2 percent of our 2022 consolidated operating revenue (2 percent in 2021 and in 2020) and 2 percent of Regulated Operations revenue in 2022 (2 percent in 2021 and 3 percent in 2020). These customers are involved in an industry that is seeing increased environmental pressure for construction of new or expanded pipeline infrastructure for the transportation of fossil fuels. Changes in regulatory rulings or permit proceedings could result in changes to operations of the pipeline network in our service territory. 
 
 Accordingly, if our industrial customers experience an economic downturn, incur a work stoppage (including strikes, lock-outs or other events), fail to compete effectively, experience decreased demand, fail to economically obtain raw materials, fail to renew or obtain necessary permits, or experience a decline in demand or prices for their product, there could be adverse effects on their operations and, consequently, this could have a negative impact on our results of operations as we are unable to remarket at similar prices the energy that would otherwise have been sold to such customers. 
 
 We may not be able to successfully implement our strategic objectives of growing load at our utilities if current or potential industrial or municipal customers are unable to successfully implement expansion plans, including the inability to obtain necessary governmental permits and approvals. 
 
 As part of our long-term strategy, we pursue new wholesale and retail loads in and around our service territories. Currently, there are several companies in northeastern Minnesota that are in the process of developing natural resource-based projects that represent long-term growth potential and load diversity for our Regulated Operations businesses. These projects may include construction of new facilities and restarts of old facilities, both of which require permitting and approvals to be obtained before the projects can be successfully implemented. If a project does not obtain any necessary governmental (including environmental) permits and approvals or if these customers are unable to successfully implement expansion plans, our long-term strategy and thus our results of operations could be adversely impacted. 

ALLETE, Inc. 2022 Form 10-K

Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued) 
 Regulated Operations Risks (Continued) 
 
 Our businesses, investments and customers are subject to an extensive legal and regulatory framework under federal and state laws as well as regulations imposed by other organizations that may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. 
 
 Our businesses, investments and customers are subject to an extensive legal and regulatory framework imposed under federal and state law including regulations administered by the FERC, MPUC, MPCA, PSCW, NDPSC and EPA as well as regulations administered by other organizations including the NERC. These laws and regulations relate to allowed rates of return, capital structure, financings, rate and cost structure, acquisition and disposal of assets and facilities, construction and operation of generation, transmission and distribution facilities (including the ongoing maintenance and reliable operation of such facilities), recovery of purchased power costs and capital investments, approval of integrated resource plans and present or prospective wholesale and retail competition, renewable portfolio standards that require utilities to obtain specified percentages of electric supply from eligible renewable generation sources, among other things. Energy policy initiatives at the state or federal level could increase or accelerate renewable and carbon-free energy standards or incentives for distributed generation, municipal utility ownership, or local initiatives could introduce generation or distribution requirements that could change the current integrated utility model. (See Item 1. Business Regulated Operations Minnesota Legislation.) Our transmission systems and electric generation facilities are subject to the NERC mandatory reliability standards, including cybersecurity standards. Compliance with these standards may lead to increased operating costs and capital expenditures which are subject to regulatory approval for recovery. If it was determined that we were not in compliance with these mandatory reliability standards or other statutes, rules and orders, we could incur substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 These laws and regulations significantly influence our operations and may affect our ability to recover costs from our customers. We are required to have numerous permits, licenses, approvals and certificates from the agencies and other organizations that regulate our business. We believe we have obtained the necessary permits, licenses, approvals and certificates for our existing operations and that our business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, we are unable to predict the impact on our operating results from the future regulatory activities of any of these agencies and other organizations. Changes in regulations, timing of approvals, the adoption of new regulations or the expansion of jurisdiction by these agencies and other organizations could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 
 
 Our ability to obtain rate adjustments to maintain reasonable rates of return depends upon regulatory action under applicable statutes and regulations, and we cannot provide assurance that rate adjustments will be obtained or reasonable authorized rates of return on capital will be earned. Minnesota Power and SWL P, from time to time, file general rate cases with, or otherwise seek cost recovery authorization from, federal and state regulatory authorities. If Minnesota Power and SWL P do not receive an adequate amount of rate relief in general rate cases, including if rates are reduced, if increased rates are not approved or recovered on a timely basis, if fuel adjustment clause recoveries or cost recovery for other items are not granted at the requested level, or costs are otherwise unable to be recovered through rates, we may experience an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We are unable to predict the impact on our business and results of operations from future legislation or regulatory activities of any of these agencies or organizations. 
 
 Our regulated operations present certain environmental risks that could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations, including effects of environmental laws and regulations, physical risks associated with climate change and initiatives designed to reduce the impact of GHG emissions. 
 
 We are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of our past, present and future operations, including air quality, water quality and usage, waste management, reclamation, hazardous wastes, avian mortality and natural resources. These laws and regulations, or new laws and regulations that may be passed, can result in increased capital expenditures and increased operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations, particularly with regard to laws relating to emissions, coal ash and water discharge at generating facilities. 
 
 These laws and regulations could restrict the output of some existing facilities, limit the use of some fuels in the production of electricity, require the installation of additional pollution control equipment, require participation in environmental emission allowance trading, and lead to other environmental considerations and costs, which could have an adverse impact on our business, operations and results of operations. 

ALLETE, Inc. 2022 Form 10-K

Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued) 
 Regulated Operations Risks (Continued) 
 
 These laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Violations of these laws and regulations could expose us to regulatory and legal proceedings, disputes with, and legal challenges by, governmental authorities and private parties, as well as potential significant civil fines criminal penalties and other sanctions. 
 
 Existing environmental regulations may be revised and new environmental regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us. Revised or additional regulations which result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from customers, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 
 There is significant uncertainty regarding if and when new laws, regulations or administrative policies will be adopted to reduce or limit GHG and the impact any such laws or regulations would have on us. In 2022, our operating coal-fired generating facilities consisted of the 352 MW Boswell Unit 3 and the 468 MW Boswell Unit 4. (See Outlook EnergyForward.) Any future limits on GHG emissions at the federal or state level, or action taken by regulators, before these facilities are retired or become coal-free may require us to incur significant capital expenditures and increases in operating costs, or could result in early closure of coal-fired generating facilities, stranded assets, an impairment of assets, denial of full recovery of decommissioning costs in excess of amounts previously collected, or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations, particularly if resulting expenditures and costs are not fully recoverable from customers. 
 
 Our regulated operations may be adversely impacted by the physical and financial risks associated with climate change. See Entity-wide Risks for additional discussion of risks related to GHG and climate change. 
 
 We cannot predict the amount or timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of uncertainty as to applicable regulations or requirements. There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties. Violations of certain environmental statutes, rules and regulations could expose ALLETE to third party disputes and potentially significant monetary penalties, as well as other sanctions for non compliance. 
 
 The operation and maintenance of our regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities are subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 The operation of generating facilities involves many risks, including start-up operational risks, breakdown or failure of facilities, the dependence on a specific fuel source, inadequate fuel supply, availability of fuel transportation, and the impact of unusual or adverse weather conditions or other natural events, as well as the risk of performance below expected levels of output or efficiency. A significant portion of our facilities contain older generating equipment, which, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures to continue operating at peak efficiency. Generation, transmission and distribution facilities and equipment are also likely to require periodic upgrades and improvements due to changing environmental standards and technological advances. We could be subject to costs associated with any unexpected failure to produce or deliver power, including failure caused by breakdown, forced outage or limited availability of fuel or fuel transportation, as well as the repair of damage to facilities due to breakdown, storms, natural disasters, wars, sabotage, terrorist acts and other catastrophic events. This could also lead to requiring additional purchased power to meet requirements of serving our retail load, which for Minnesota Power is subject to recovery under the fuel adjustment clause. Should these costs be denied or are otherwise unable to be recovered, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted. 
 
 Our ability to successfully and timely complete capital repairs or improvements to existing regulated facilities or other capital projects is contingent upon many variables. 
 
 We expect to incur significant capital expenditures in making capital repairs or improvements to our existing electric generation and transmission facilities and in the development and construction of new electric generation and transmission facilities. Should any such efforts be unsuccessful, not completed in a timely manner or if there are increases in the costs for or limited availability of key materials, supplies, labor and services, we could be subject to additional costs or impairments, and projects may be delayed or canceled which could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operation and cash flows.

Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued) 
 Regulated Operations Risks (Continued) 
 
 Our regulated electric operations may not have access to adequate and reliable transmission and distribution facilities necessary to deliver electricity to our customers. 
 
 We depend on our own transmission and distribution facilities, as well as facilities owned by other utilities, to deliver the electricity sold to our customers, and to other energy suppliers. If transmission capacity is inadequate or transmission and distribution facilities we rely on are damaged, our ability to sell and deliver electricity may be limited. We may have to forgo sales or may have to buy more expensive wholesale electricity that is available in a capacity-constrained area. The ability to restore adequate capacity or repair damaged infrastructure may be impacted by the availability of key materials, supplies, labor and services, which if unavailable may prolong the impact of capacity constraints or damaged facilities. In addition, any infrastructure failure or damage that interrupts or impairs delivery of electricity to our customers could negatively impact the satisfaction of our customers, which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 
 
 The price of electricity may be volatile and fuel may be volatile and availability may be limited. 
 
 Volatility in market prices for electricity and volatility and limited availability of fuel could adversely impact our financial position and results of operations and may result from: 
 
 severe or unexpected weather conditions and natural disasters; 
 seasonality; 
 changes in electricity usage; 
 transmission or transportation constraints, inoperability or inefficiencies; 
 availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources; 
 changes in supply and demand for energy; 
 changes in power production capacity; 
 outages at our generating facilities or those of our competitors; 
 availability of fuel and transportation of fuel; 
 changes in production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite, coal, crude oil and refined products; 
 wars, sabotage, terrorist acts or other catastrophic events; and 
 federal, state, local and foreign energy, environmental, or other regulation and legislation. 
 
 Volatility in market prices for our fuel and purchase power costs impacts our sales to retail, municipal and Other Power Suppliers. Fluctuations in our fuel and purchased power costs related to our retail and municipal customers are passed on to customers through the fuel adjustment clause; however, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted if increased fuel adjustment clause rates are not approved or recovered on a timely basis, if cost recovery is not granted at the requested level, or costs are otherwise unable to be recovered through the fuel adjustment clause. 
 
 Wholesale prices for electricity have also declined in recent years primarily due to the extension of renewable tax credits and additional renewable generation commencing operations. If there are reductions in demand from current customers, we lose retail customers, or we lose municipal customers that do not renew existing contracts, we will market any available power to Other Power Suppliers in an effort to mitigate any earnings impact. Sales to Other Power Suppliers are sold at market-based prices into the MISO market on a daily basis or through bilateral agreements of various durations. Due to wholesale prices for electricity being below our rates for retail and municipal customers, we do not expect that our power marketing efforts would fully offset the reduction in earnings resulting from the lower demand from existing customers or the loss of customers.

 Regulated Operations Risks (Continued) 
 
 Demand for energy may decrease. 
 
 Our results of operations are impacted by the demand for energy in our service territories, our municipal customers and other power suppliers. There could be lower demand for energy due to a loss of customers as a result of economic conditions, customers constructing or installing their own generation facilities, higher costs and rates charged to customers, eligible municipal and other power suppliers choosing an alternative energy provider, or loss of service territory or franchises. Further, energy conservation and technological advances that increased energy efficiency may temporarily or permanently reduce the demand for energy products. In addition, we are impacted by state and federal regulations requiring mandatory conservation measures, which reduce the demand for energy products. Continuing technology improvements and regulatory developments may make customer and third party-owned generation technologies such as rooftop solar systems, WTGs, microturbines and battery storage systems more cost effective and feasible for certain customers. If customers utilize their own generation, demand for energy from us would decline. There may not be future economic growth opportunities that would enable us to replace the lost energy demand from these customers. Therefore, a decrease in demand for energy could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 ALLETE Clean Energy / Corporate and Other Risks 
 
 The inability to successfully manage and grow our businesses could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 The Company's strategy includes adding customers, new geographies, and growth through acquisitions or project development with long-term PSAs in place for the output or to be sold upon completion. This strategy depends, in part, on the Company s ability to successfully identify and evaluate acquisition or development opportunities and consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms. The Company may compete with other companies for these acquisition and development opportunities, which may increase the Company s cost of making acquisitions and the Company may be unsuccessful in pursuing these acquisition opportunities. Other companies may be able to pay more for acquisitions and may be able to identify, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of assets than the Company s financial or human resources permit. New laws and regulations promoting renewable energy generation may result in increased competition. Our ALLETE Clean Energy business is experiencing return pressures from increased competition, and lower forward price curves, as a growing amount of investment capital is being directed into wind energy generation opportunities. In addition, current and potential new project developments at our businesses can be negatively affected by a lower ALLETE stock price, which may result in such projects not being accretive, or otherwise unable to satisfy our financial objectives criteria to proceed. Additionally, tax law changes may adversely impact the economic characteristics of potential acquisitions or investments. If the Company is unable to execute its strategy of growth through acquisitions, project development for others, or the addition of new customers and geographies, it may impede our long-term objectives and business strategy. 
 
 Acquisitions are subject to uncertainties. If we are unable to successfully integrate and manage the acquisition of New Energy, or future acquisitions and strategic investments, this could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Our actual results may also differ from our expectations due to factors such as the ability to obtain timely regulatory or governmental approvals, integration and operational issues and the ability to retain management and other key personnel. 
 
 Our results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in governmental incentives or policies that support renewable energy or changes in taxes, tariffs, duties or other assessments on renewable energy or the equipment necessary to generate and deliver it. 
 
 Any reductions or modifications to, or the elimination of, governmental incentives or policies that support renewable energy, or the imposition of additional or increased sourcing of components subject to taxes, tariffs, duties or other assessments on renewable energy or the equipment necessary to generate and deliver it, could result in, among other items, the lack of a satisfactory market for the development or financing of new renewable energy projects and reduced project returns on current or future projects.

Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued) 
 ALLETE Clean Energy / Corporate and Other Risks (Continued) 
 
 The U.S. government currently imposes antidumping and countervailing duties on certain imported photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules from China and Taiwan. Such duties can change over time pursuant to annual reviews conducted by the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC). In March 2022, the U.S. DOC launched an investigation into alleged circumvention of these duties by imports of certain PV cells and modules assembled and completed in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. In June 2022, the U.S. President declared an emergency with respect to threats to electricity generation capacity and authorized the U.S. Secretary of Commerce to consider permitting the importation of certain PV products from those four countries free of antidumping and countervailing duties for 24 months, or until the emergency has terminated. The U.S. DOC has issued final regulations designed to implement that moratorium in the event that it finds circumvention in its ongoing inquiries. We cannot predict what further actions the U.S. DOC will take with respect to these circumvention inquiries. Our operating results could be adversely impacted if the U.S. DOC makes circumvention determinations that result in duties assessed on future purchases made by our businesses after the moratorium ends. 
 
 The generation of electricity from wind and solar energy facilities depends heavily on suitable meteorological conditions. 
 
 Although our electric generation facilities are located in diverse geographic regions to reduce the potential impact that may be caused by unfavorable weather in a particular region, suitable meteorological conditions are variable and difficult to predict. If wind or solar conditions are unfavorable or meteorological conditions are unsuitable, electricity generation and revenue from wind and solar energy facilities may be substantially below our expectations. The electricity produced, production tax credits received, and revenues generated by a wind or solar energy facility are highly dependent on suitable wind conditions and associated weather conditions, which are variable and beyond our control. We base our decisions about which wind and solar projects to build or acquire as well as our electricity generation estimates, in part, on the findings of long-term wind and other meteorological studies conducted on the project site and its region; however, the unpredictable nature of wind and solar conditions, weather and meteorological conditions can result in material deviations from these studies and our expectations. Furthermore, components of our systems could be damaged by severe weather, such as hailstorms, lightning or tornadoes. In addition, replacement and spare parts for key components may be difficult or costly to acquire or may be unavailable. Unfavorable wind and solar conditions, weather or changes to meteorological patterns could impair the effectiveness of our electric generation facility assets, reduce their output beneath their rated capacity or require shutdown of key equipment, impeding operation of our wind energy facilities or lead to an impairment of assets. 
 
 The construction, operation and maintenance of our electric generation facilities or investment in facilities are subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 The construction and operation of generating facilities involves many risks, including the performance by key contracted suppliers and maintenance providers; increases in the costs for or limited availability of key materials, supplies, labor and services; start-up operations risks; breakdown or failure of facilities; curtailment of facilities by counterparties; the dependence on the availability of wind resources; or the impact of unusual, adverse weather conditions or other natural events, as well as the risk of performance below expected levels of output or efficiency. Some of our facilities contain older generating equipment, which even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures to continue operating at peak efficiency. We could be subject to costs associated with any unexpected failure to produce and deliver power, including failure caused by breakdown or forced outage, as well as the repair of damage to facilities due to storms, natural disasters, wars, sabotage, terrorist acts and other catastrophic events. 
 
 The price of electricity may be volatile, which may impact results of operations at ALLETE Clean Energy wind energy facilities under contracts with customer and industrial (C I) customers. 
 
 Unusual, adverse weather conditions or other natural events and different settlement prices between hub and node can cause volatility in market prices for electricity and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. ALLETE Clean Energy s power sales agreements with C I customers at its Diamond Spring and Caddo wind energy facilities are contracts for differences where power is delivered to the market, a fixed price is paid by the customers to ALLETE Clean Energy, and differences between the market price and the fixed price are paid to or received from the customers. Certain contracts also settle with the market at the hub price whereas ALLETE Clean Energy settles with the customer at the node price which can vary significantly based on multiple factors. These settlement provisions can result in an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows when market prices are volatile.

Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued) 
 ALLETE Clean Energy / Corporate and Other Risks (Continued) 
 
 As contracts with counterparties expire, we may not be able to replace them with agreements on similar terms or divest the related assets at a profit. 
 
 ALLETE Clean Energy is party to PSAs that expire in various years between 2024 and 2039. These PSA expirations are prior to the end of the estimated useful lives of the respective wind energy facilities. If, for any reason, ALLETE Clean Energy is unable to enter into new agreements with existing or new counterparties on similar terms once the current agreements expire, sell energy in the wholesale market resulting in similar revenue, or enter into a contract to sell the facility at a profit, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected, which includes potential impairment of property, plant and equipment. 
 
 Counterparties to turbine and other generation supply, service and maintenance, or power sale agreements may not fulfill their obligations. 
 
 Our businesses are party to turbine and other generation supply agreements, service and maintenance agreements, and PSAs under various durations with a limited number of creditworthy counterparties. If, for any reason, any of the counterparties under these agreements do not fulfill their related contractual obligations, and we are unable to mitigate non-performance by a key supplier or maintenance provider or remarket PSA energy resulting in similar revenue, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
 
 ALLETE has a significant amount of goodwill. A determination that goodwill has been impaired could result in a significant non-cash charge to earnings. 
 
 We had approximately 155 million of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022 related to New Energy. If we change our business strategy, fail to deliver on our projected results or if market or other conditions adversely affect the operations of New Energy, we may be required to record an impairment charge. Declines in projected operating cash flows at New Energy could also result in an impairment charge. An impairment charge would result in a non-cash charge to earnings that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 
 BNI Energy may be adversely impacted by its exposure to customer concentration, and environmental laws and regulations. 
 
 BNI Energy sells lignite coal to two electric generating cooperatives, Minnkota Power and Square Butte, and could be adversely impacted if these customers were unable or unwilling to fulfill their related contractual obligations, or change the way in which they operate their generating facilities. In addition, BNI Energy and its customers may be adversely impacted by existing or new environmental laws and regulations which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, insurance companies have decreased the available coverage for policy holders in the mining industry, impacting the availability of coverage, and leading to higher deductibles and premiums. 
 
 Real estate market conditions where our legacy Florida real estate investment is located may deteriorate. 
 
 The Company s strategy related to the real estate assets of ALLETE Properties incorporates the possibility of a bulk sale of its entire portfolio, in addition to sales over time, however, adverse market conditions could impact the timing of land sales, which could result in little to no sales, while still incurring operating expenses such as community development district assessments and property taxes, resulting in net operating losses at ALLETE Properties. Furthermore, weak market conditions could put the properties at risk for an impairment charge. An impairment charge would result in a non-cash charge to earnings that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 
 Entity-wide Risks 
 
 We could be materially adversely affected by health epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks. 
 
 Health epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks, as well as the related federal and state government responses, can have widespread impacts on the economy and on our employees, customers, contractors and suppliers, such as those experienced from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. There may be uncertainty regarding the length of time an epidemic, pandemic or other outbreak will last, how they will evolve, or the extent and duration of any measures attempted to try and contain them.

Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued) 
 Entity-wide Risks (Continued) 
 
 A disruption of economic activity or an extended disruption of economic activity may lead to adverse impacts on our taconite, paper, pulp and secondary wood products, and pipeline customers operations including reduced production or the temporary idling or indefinite shutdown of facilities, which would result in lower sales and revenue from these customers. A disruption in capital markets could lead to increased borrowing costs or adversely impact our ability to access capital markets or other financing sources, which would adversely affect our ability to maintain our businesses or to implement our business plans. An epidemic, pandemic or other outbreak may also result in a disruption to our supply chains which could adversely impact our operations and capital projects resulting in project and operational delays, project cancellations, lower returns on projects and cost increases. 
 
 Despite any efforts made to mitigate the impacts on the Company of an epidemic, pandemic or other outbreak, their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our control, including their duration and severity as well as governmental and third-party actions taken to contain their spread and mitigate their public health effects. As a result, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of an epidemic, pandemic or other outbreak, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and whether it will have a material impact on our liquidity, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 We rely on access to financing sources and capital markets. If we do not have access to capital on acceptable terms or are unable to obtain capital when needed, our ability to execute our business plans, make capital expenditures or pursue other strategic actions that we may otherwise rely on for future growth would be adversely affected. 
 
 We rely on access to financing sources and the capital markets, on acceptable terms and at reasonable costs, as sources of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by our cash flows from operations. Rising interest rates, inflation and market disruptions or a downgrade of our credit ratings may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to access and finance in the capital markets or to access other financing sources such as tax equity financing. Such disruptions or causes of a downgrade could include but are not limited to: weakening of the Company s cash flow metrics; a loss of, or a reduction in sales to, our taconite, paper and pipeline customers if we are unable to offset the related lost margins; weaker operating performance; adverse regulatory outcomes; disproportionate increase in the contribution to net income from ALLETE Clean Energy and our Corporate and Other businesses as compared to that from our Regulated Operations; deteriorating economic or capital market conditions; or volatility in commodity prices. 
 
 If we are not able to access capital on acceptable terms in sufficient amounts and when needed, or at all, the ability to maintain our businesses or to implement our business plans would be adversely affected. This would include our ability to make the significant capital expenditures planned in order to achieve Minnesota Power s clean-energy transition plans. (See Item 7. Capital Requirements.) 
 
 A deterioration in general economic conditions, an inflationary environment or supply chain disruptions may have adverse impacts on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 If economic conditions deteriorate, we experience an inflationary environment or supply chains are disrupted on a national, regional or global level, it may have a negative impact on our customers and the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. This impact may include volatility and unpredictability in the demand for the products and services offered by our businesses, the loss of existing customers, tempered growth strategies, customer production cutbacks, customer bankruptcies and increases in costs for or limited availability of key materials, supplies, labor and services for our operations and capital projects. An uncertain economy could also adversely affect expenses including pension costs, interest costs, and uncollectible accounts, or lead to reductions in the value of certain real estate and other investments. 
 
 Our utility infrastructure and generating facilities, ongoing and future capital and development projects, and other operations require components, supplies, materials, labor and services sourced from suppliers or providers who, in turn, may source components from their suppliers. A shortage of key components, supplies, materials, labor or services in which an alternative supplier or provider is not identified could significantly impact project plans or our operations. Such impacts could include project delays, including potential for project cancellation, lower project returns, increased costs or the inability to provide service to customers, which could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued) 
 Entity-wide Risks (Continued) 
 
 Our businesses, investments and customers are subject to extensive state and federal legislation and regulation, compliance with which could have an adverse effect on our businesses. 
 
 Our businesses, investments and customers are subject to, and affected by, extensive state and federal legislation and regulation. If it was determined that our businesses failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or be required to implement additional compliance measures or actions, the cost of which could be material. Adoption of new laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices by federal and state agencies, or changes to or a failure to comply with current laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices and their interpretations, could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 The inability to attract and retain a qualified workforce including, but not limited to, executive officers, key employees and employees with specialized skills, could have an adverse effect on our operations. 
 
 The success of our business heavily depends on the leadership of our executive officers and key employees to implement our business strategy. The inability to maintain a qualified workforce, including, but not limited to, executive officers, key employees and employees with specialized skills, may negatively affect our ability to service our existing or new customers, or successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives. Personnel costs may increase due to competitive pressures, inflation or terms of collective bargaining agreements with union employees. 
 
 Market performance and other changes could decrease the value of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets, which may result in significant additional funding requirements and increased annual expenses. 
 
 The performance of the capital markets impacts the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. We have significant obligations to these plans and the trusts hold significant assets. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below our projected rates of return. A decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets would increase the funding requirements under our benefit plans if asset returns do not recover. Additionally, our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements. Our pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs are generally recoverable in our electric rates as allowed by our regulators or through our cost-plus fixed fee coal supply agreements at BNI Energy; however, there is no certainty that regulators will continue to allow recovery of these rising costs in the future. 
 
 We are exposed to significant reputational risk. 
 
 The Company could suffer negative impacts to its reputation as a result of operational incidents, violations of corporate compliance policies, regulatory violations, operations that produce or enable the production of GHG emissions or other events which may result in negative customer perception, increased regulatory oversight, and negative consequences to our credit ratings and ability to access capital, each of which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 We are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change and other catastrophic events, such as natural disasters and acts of war. 
 
 Catastrophic events at or near Company facilities and equipment on which the Company depends upon or that otherwise impact the Company such as fires, wildfires, including the impact to Company facilities and operations or potential liability if caused by Company equipment, earthquakes, explosions, and floods, severe weather, such as ice storms, hailstorms, or tornadoes or similar occurrences, as well as acts of war, could adversely affect the Company s facilities, operations, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Although the Company has contingency plans and employs crisis management to respond and recover operations in the event of a severe disruption resulting from a catastrophic event, these measures may not be successful. Furthermore, despite these measures, if a catastrophic event were to occur, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued) 
 Entity-wide Risks (Continued) 
 
 The scientific community generally accepts that emissions of GHG are linked to global climate change. Physical risks of climate change, such as more frequent, longer duration or more extreme weather events, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, increased risk of wildfires, changes to ground and surface water availability, and other related phenomena, could affect some, or all, of our operations. Severe weather or other natural disasters could be destructive, which could result in increased costs or limit the availability of key materials, supplies, labor and services used in our operations or to respond to damaged facilities. An extreme weather event can also directly affect our capital assets, causing disruption in service to customers due to facility outages, downed wires and poles or damage to other operating equipment. 
 
 Climate-related risks that could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations include effects of environmental- or economic-based laws, regulations, incentives or initiatives designed to reduce the quantity or impact of GHG emissions, the ability of our regulated businesses to obtain rate adjustments to recover costs and investments to implement clean-energy transition plans, or disruptions to the economy or energy markets caused by climate change. This includes the risk of laws or regulations that create mandates that do not allow for a transition that protects the safety, reliability or affordability of energy for our customers, are implemented before cost-effective technology is developed and regulatory policy is established, or require the electric sector to decarbonize faster than other sectors and ahead of our current goal to deliver 100 percent carbon-free energy to customers by 2050. Additionally, restrictions on land use, wildlife impacts, and other environmental regulations could affect the siting, construction and operation of new or existing generation and transmission facilities needed to transition to lower-carbon generation sources. 
 
 These all have the potential to adversely affect our business and operations. 
 
 We are vulnerable to acts of terrorism or cybersecurity attacks. 
 
 Our operations may be targets of terrorist activities or cybersecurity attacks, which could disrupt our ability to provide utility service at our regulated utilities, develop or operate our renewable energy projects at ALLETE Clean Energy, or operate our other businesses. The impacts may also impair the fulfillment of critical business functions, negatively impact our reputation, subject us to litigation or increased regulation, or compromise sensitive, confidential and other data. 
 
 There have been cybersecurity attacks on U.S. energy infrastructure in the past and there may be such attacks in the future. Our generation, transmission and distribution facilities, information technology systems and other infrastructure facilities and systems could be direct targets of, or otherwise be materially adversely affected by such activities. Hacking, computer viruses, terrorism, theft and sabotage could impact our systems and facilities, or those of third parties on which we rely, which may disrupt our operations. 
 
 Our businesses require the continued operation of sophisticated custom-developed, purchased, and leased information technology systems and network infrastructure as well as the collection and retention of personally identifiable information of our customers, shareholders and employees. Although we maintain security measures designed to prevent cybersecurity incidents and protect our information technology and control systems, network infrastructure and other assets, our technology systems, or those of third parties on which we rely, may be vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism as well as other causes. If those technology systems fail or are breached and not recovered in a timely manner, we may be unable to perform critical business functions including effectively maintaining certain internal controls over financial reporting, our reputation may be negatively impacted, we may become subject to litigation or increased regulation, and sensitive, confidential and other data could be compromised. If our business were impacted by terrorist activities or cybersecurity attacks, such impacts could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties we face. 
 
 We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties we face. The occurrence of these risks and uncertainties, if not fully covered by insurance, could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

 Entity-wide Risks (Continued) 
 
 Government challenges to our tax positions, as well as tax law changes and the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of our operations and business decisions, could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. 
 
 We are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and our ongoing operations in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities. The obligations, which include income taxes and taxes other than income taxes, involve complex matters that ultimately could be litigated. We also estimate our ability to use tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards and tax credits that are recorded as deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. A disallowance of some or all of these tax benefits could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 We are currently utilizing, and plan to utilize in the future, our carryforwards and tax credits to reduce our income tax obligations. If we cannot generate enough taxable income in the future to utilize all of our carryforwards and tax credits before they expire, we may incur adverse charges to earnings. 
 
 If federal or state tax authorities deny any deductions or tax credits, negatively change existing tax laws or policies, or fail to extend or renew policies beneficial to the Company, such as those for renewable energy production tax credits, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted.

2022 Financial Overview 
 
 The following net income discussion summarizes a comparison of the year ended December 31, 2022 to the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 
 Net income attributable to ALLETE in 2022 was 189.3 million, or 3.38 per diluted share, compared to 169.2 million, or 3.23 per diluted share, in 2021. Net income in 2022 included higher earnings at Minnesota Power resulting from the implementation of interim rates on January 1, 2022, net of interim rate reserves, and also included net income of 7.8 million from New Energy, which was acquired in April 2022. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings from ALLETE Clean Energy reflecting challenges under the Caddo and Diamond Spring wind energy facilities power sales agreements and additional losses related to the sale of the Northern Wind project. Net income in 2021 included South Shore Energy s sale of a portion of its interest in NTEC to Basin Electric Cooperative and the resulting recognition of an approximately 8.5 million after-tax gain, or 0.16 per share, related to prior development costs and risks incurred. Net income in 2021 also included an approximately 5 million after-tax, or 0.10 per share, negative impact related to ALLETE Clean Energy s Diamond Spring wind energy facility due to an extreme winter storm event in the southwest United States in February 2021. Earnings per share dilution in 2022 was 0.23 due to additional shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Regulated Operations net income attributable to ALLETE was 149.9 million in 2022, compared to 129.1 million in 2021. Net income at Minnesota Power was higher than 2021 primarily due to the implementation of interim rates on January 1, 2022, net of interim rate reserves. This increase was partially offset by higher costs under a PPA with Manitoba Hydro, higher operating and maintenance expense, and lower kWh sales to industrial customers. Our after-tax equity earnings in ATC were lower than 2021 primarily due to period over period changes in ATC s estimate of a refund liability related to the appeals court decision on MISO return on equity complaints. (See Note 6. Equity Investments.) 
 
 ALLETE Clean Energy net income attributable to ALLETE was 16.3 million in 2022 compared to 26.3 million in 2021. Net income in 2022 reflected challenges under the Caddo and Diamond Spring wind energy facilities power sales agreements resulting from extreme market volatility and transmission congestion in the Southwest Power Pool. Net income in 2022 also included additional losses related to the sale of the Northern Wind project. Net income in 2021 included an approximately 5 million after-tax negative impact related to ALLETE Clean Energy s Diamond Spring wind energy facility due to an extreme winter storm event in the southwest United States in February 2021. 
 
 Corporate and Other net income attributable to ALLETE was 23.1 million in 2022 compared to 13.8 million in 2021. Net income in 2022 reflects net income from New Energy of 7.8 million, which included a 8.3 million after-tax expense as a result of purchase price accounting related to projects under development at the time of acquisition. Net income in 2022 also reflects higher earnings from our investment in Nobles 2 due to higher wind resources in 2022, higher land sales at ALLETE Properties, earnings from Minnesota solar projects placed into service in 2022 and lower income taxes. These increases were partially offset by transaction costs of 2.7 million after-tax related to the acquisition of New Energy, and higher other expenses compared to 2021. Net income in 2021 included South Shore Energy s sale of a portion of its interest in NTEC to Basin which resulted in the recognition of an approximately 8.5 million after-tax gain related to prior development costs and risks incurred.

 Operating Revenue Utility increased 31.4 million from 2021 primarily due to the implementation of interim rates at Minnesota Power on January 1, 2022, as well as increased recoveries under the Minnesota conservation improvement program and higher gas sales. These increases were partially offset by lower revenue from kWh sales and lower fuel adjustment clause recoveries. 
 
 Interim retail rate revenue of 85.5 million was collected in 2022, which was partially offset by an interim rate refund reserve of approximately 18 million due to the regulatory outcome of the MPUC s decision in Minnesota Power s 2022 general rate case. In addition, Minnesota Power recorded a charge of approximately 8 million pre-tax to write off the deferred portion of residential customer interim rates. Minnesota Power also recorded additional revenue of approximately 9 million pre-tax for an increase in expected recoveries under its cost recovery riders. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.) 
 
 Conservation improvement program recoveries increased 5.9 million from 2021 primarily due to an increase in related expenditures. (See Operating Expenses - Operating and Maintenance.) 
 
 Gas sales at SWL P increased 4.6 million as a result of colder weather and higher gas prices in 2022 compared to 2021. (See Fuel, Purchased Power and Gas Utility.) 
 
 Lower kWh sales reduced revenue 27.4 million from 2021 reflecting lower sales to industrial customers and other power suppliers, partially offset by higher sales to residential and commercial customers as well as higher pricing on sales to other power suppliers. Sales to residential and commercial customers increased from 2021 primarily due to colder weather in 2022 compared to 2021. Sales to industrial customers decreased primarily due to lower sales to taconite customers resulting from less taconite production in 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting Cliffs Northshore mine being temporarily idled in 2022. (See Outlook - Customers - Northshore Mining.) Sales to other power suppliers, which are sold at market-based prices into the MISO market on a daily basis or through PSAs of various durations, decreased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to additional kWh sales made in 2021 to mitigate the uncertainty of customers energy needs and potential load loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

 Revenue from electric sales to taconite customers accounted for 32 percent of regulated operating revenue in 2022 (33 percent in 2021). Revenue from electric sales to paper, pulp and secondary wood product customers accounted for 5 percent of regulated operating revenue in 2022 (5 percent in 2021). Revenue from electric sales to pipelines and other industrial customers accounted for 10 percent of regulated operating revenue in 2022 (9 percent in 2021). 
 
 Fuel adjustment clause revenue decreased 24.1 million primarily due to lower kWh sales, partially offset by higher fuel and purchased power costs attributable to retail and municipal customers. (See Fuel, Purchased Power and Gas Utility.) Fuel adjustment clause revenue in 2021 also reflected a 5 million charge recorded in 2021 resulting from the MPUC s decision to order refunds in Minnesota Power s fuel adjustment clause filing covering the period July 2018 through December 2019. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.) 
 
 Operating Expenses increased 5.5 million from 2021. 
 
 Operating and Maintenance expense increased 23.3 million, or 11 percent, from 2021 primarily due to higher conservation improvement program expenses, professional services and materials purchased for generation facilities, labor expenses and higher vegetation management expenses. These increases were partially offset by lower pension and other postretirement benefit expenses. In addition, 2022 included rate case-related expenses for Minnesota Power s rate case. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.) 
 
 Transmission Services Utility expense increased 1.4 million, or 2 percent, from 2021 primarily due to higher MISO-related expense. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization expense increased 1.2 million, or 1 percent, from 2021 primarily due to a higher plant in service balance in 2022. 
 
 Fuel, Purchased Power and Gas Utility expense decreased 16.9 million, or 3 percent, from 2021 primarily due to lower energy purchases due to lower kWh sales, partially offset by higher purchased power prices and fuel prices. Fuel and purchased power expense related to our retail and municipal customers is recovered through the fuel adjustment clause. 
 
 Taxes Other than Income Taxes decreased 3.5 million, or 6 percent, from 2021 primarily due to lower property tax expense resulting from an updated estimate of taxable market values and rates in 2022. 
 
 Equity Earnings decreased 2.0 million from, or 9 percent, 2021 primarily due to period over period changes in ATC s estimate of a refund liability related to the appeals court decision on MISO return on equity complaints. (See Note 6. Equity Investments.) 
 
 Other Income increased 3.9 million from 2021 primarily due to lower pension and other postretirement plan non-service credits. (See Note 1. Operations and Significant Accounting Policies.)

 Operating and Maintenance expense increased 5.8 million, or 14 percent, from 2021 primarily due to operating and maintenance expenses related to the Caddo wind energy facility, which commenced operations in December 2021. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization expense increased 9.4 million, or 19 percent, from 2021 primarily due to additional property, plant and equipment in service related to the Caddo wind energy facility, which commenced operations in December 2021. 
 
 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased 3.6 million from 2021 primarily due to higher property tax expense related to the Caddo wind energy facility, which commenced operations in December 2021. 
 
 Other Income increased 10.5 million from 2021 primarily due to a gain on removal of the PSA liability for the Northern Wind project upon decommissioning of the wind energy facilities. (See Cost of Sales Non-utility and Outlook ALLETE Clean Energy.) 
 
 Net Loss Attributable to Non-Controlling Interest increased 22.6 million from 2021 reflecting net losses attributable to non-controlling interest for the Caddo wind energy facility as well as higher net losses attributable to non-controlling interests for the Glen Ullin and Diamond Spring wind energy facilities resulting from higher wind resources and a higher PTC value in 2022 compared to 2021. 
 
 Corporate and Other 
 
 Operating Revenue increased 88.7 million, or 85 percent, from 2021 reflecting revenue from New Energy, which was acquired in April 2022, higher revenue at BNI Energy which operates under cost-plus fixed fee contracts, as a result of higher expenses in 2022 compared to 2021 and higher land sales at ALLETE Properties compared to 2021. 
 
 Net Income Attributable to ALLETE was 23.1 million in 2022 compared to 13.8 million in 2021. Net income in 2022 reflects net income from New Energy of 7.8 million, which included a 8.3 million after-tax expense as a result of purchase price accounting related to projects under development at the time of acquisition. Net income in 2022 also reflects higher earnings from our investment in Nobles 2 due to higher wind resources in 2022, higher land sales at ALLETE Properties, earnings from Minnesota solar projects placed into service in 2022 and lower income taxes. These increases were partially offset by transaction costs of 2.7 million after-tax related to the acquisition of New Energy, and higher other expenses compared to 2021. Net income in 2021 included South Shore Energy s sale of a portion of its interest in NTEC to Basin which resulted in the recognition of an approximately 8.5 million after-tax gain related to prior development costs and risks incurred. 
 
 Income Taxes Consolidated 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the effective tax rate was a benefit of 31.2 percent (benefit of 24.3 percent for the year ended December 31, 2021). The effective tax rate for 2022 was a lower benefit primarily due to lower production tax credits, higher pre-tax income and higher net losses attributable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries. (See Note 11. Income Tax Expense.) 
 
 2021 Compared to 2020 
 
 The comparison of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 is included in Management's Discussion in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. We have identified an immaterial prior period error with respect to the recognition of a non-cash impairment expense for our Northern Wind operating assets in 2020, and the prior period results have been revised accordingly for comparability. See Note 1. Operations and Significant Accounting Policies for additional information. 

ALLETE, Inc. 2022 Form 10-K

Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make various estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates and assumptions may be revised, which may have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. These policies are discussed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a regular basis. We believe the following policies are most critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations. 
 
 Regulatory Accounting. Our regulated utility operations are subject to accounting standards for the effects of certain types of regulation. These standards require us to reflect the effect of regulatory decisions in our financial statements. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred as they are probable for recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities represent obligations to make refunds to customers and amounts collected in rates for which the related costs have not yet been incurred. The Company assesses quarterly whether regulatory assets and liabilities meet the criteria for probability of future recovery or deferral. This assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment and recent rate orders to other regulated entities under the same jurisdiction. If future recovery or refund of costs becomes no longer probable, the assets and liabilities would be recognized in current period net income or other comprehensive income. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.) 
 
 Pension and Postretirement Health and Life Actuarial Assumptions. We account for our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations in accordance with the accounting standards for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. These standards require the use of several important assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and mortality assumptions, among others, in determining our obligations and the annual cost of our pension and other postretirement benefits. In establishing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we determine the long-term historical performance of each asset class and adjust these for current economic conditions while utilizing the target allocation of our plan assets to forecast the expected long-term rate of return. Our pension asset allocation as of December 31, 2022, was approximately 46 percent equity securities, 50 percent fixed income and 4 percent real estate. Our postretirement health and life asset allocation as of December 31, 2022, was approximately 66 percent equity securities, and 34 percent fixed income. Equity securities consist of a mix of market capitalization sizes with domestic and international securities. In 2022, we used weighted average expected long-term rates of return of 6.00 percent in our actuarial determination of our pension expense and 5.41 percent in our actuarial determination of our other postretirement expense. The actuarial determination uses an asset smoothing methodology for actual returns to reduce the volatility of varying investment performance over time. We review our expected long-term rate of return assumption annually and will adjust it to respond to changing market conditions. A one-quarter percent decrease in the expected long-term rate of return would increase the annual expense for pension and other postretirement benefits by approximately 2.2 million, pre-tax. 
 
 The discount rate is computed using a bond matching study which utilizes a portfolio of high quality bonds that produce cash flows similar to the projected costs of our pension and other postretirement plans. In 2022, we used weighted average discount rates of 3.28 percent and 3.09 percent in our actuarial determination of our pension and other postretirement expense, respectively. We review our discount rates annually and will adjust them to respond to changing market conditions. A one-quarter percent decrease in the discount rate would increase the annual expense for pension and other postretirement benefits by approximately 1.0 million, pre-tax. 
 
 The mortality assumptions used to calculate our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of December 31, 2022, considered a modified PRI-2012 mortality table and MP-2021 mortality projection scale. (See Note 12. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans.) 
 
 Valuation of Business Combinations and Resulting Goodwill. When we acquire a business, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination requires us to make significant estimates. These estimates may include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows to present value, the assessment of the asset s life cycle, and the consideration of legal, technical, regulatory, economic and competitive risks. 

ALLETE, Inc. 2022 Form 10-K

Critical Accounting Policies (Continued) 
 
 Goodwill. Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair value of the net assets of the acquired businesses. In accordance with GAAP, goodwill is not amortized. The Company assesses whether there has been an impairment of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at the reporting unit level. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment test are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value. The fair value of the New Energy reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow model, using significant assumptions which included a discount rate of 14 percent, cash flow forecasts through 2027, industry average gross margins, and a terminal growth rate of 3.5 percent. Any forecast contains a degree of uncertainty, and changes in the forecasted cash flows and other assumptions could significantly increase or decrease the calculated fair value of New Energy. The results of our annual impairment test are discussed in Note 1. Operations and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7. Fair Value in this Form 10-K. Goodwill was 154.9 million as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. We review our long-lived assets for indicators of impairment in accordance with the accounting standards for property, plant and equipment on a quarterly basis. 
 
 In accordance with the accounting standards for property, plant and equipment, if indicators of impairment exist, we test our long-lived assets for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Cash flows are assessed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. The undiscounted future net cash flows are impacted by trends and factors known to us at the time they are calculated and our expectations related to: management s best estimate of future sales prices; holding period and timing of sales; method of disposition; and future expenditures necessary to maintain the operations. 
 
 Taxation. We are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and our ongoing operations to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income taxes and taxes other than income taxes. Judgments related to income taxes require the recognition in our financial statements of the largest tax benefit of a tax position that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained on audit. Tax positions that do not meet the more-likely-than-not criteria are reflected as a tax liability in accordance with the accounting standards for uncertainty in income taxes. We record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to the extent it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
 
 We are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions. We make assumptions and judgments each reporting period to estimate our income tax assets, liabilities, benefits and expenses. Judgments and assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections. Our assumptions and judgments include the application of tax statutes and regulations, and projections of future federal taxable income, state taxable income, and state apportionment to determine our ability to utilize NOL and credit carryforwards prior to their expiration. Significant changes in assumptions regarding future federal and state taxable income or a change in tax rates could require new or increased valuation allowances which could result in a material impact on our results of operations.

Outlook 
 
 ALLETE is an energy company committed to earning a financial return that rewards our shareholders, allows for reinvestment in our businesses, and sustains growth. The Company has a long-term objective of achieving consolidated earnings per share growth within a range of 5 percent to 7 percent. 
 
 ALLETE is predominately a regulated utility through Minnesota Power, SWL P, and an investment in ATC. ALLETE s strategy is to remain predominately a regulated utility while investing in ALLETE Clean Energy, New Energy and its Corporate and Other businesses to complement its regulated businesses, balance exposure to the utility s industrial customers, and provide potential long-term earnings growth. ALLETE expects net income from Regulated Operations to be approximately 75 percent of total consolidated net income in 2023. ALLETE expects its businesses to generally provide regulated, contracted or recurring revenues, and to support sustained growth in net income and cash flow. 
 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law. We believe our businesses will benefit from certain provisions of the legislation including from the extension and transferability of production tax credits and investment tax credits, among others. We do not anticipate any impact from the new alternative minimum tax. We will continue to assess the impact of the legislation as additional implementation guidance becomes available. 
 
 Minnesota Carbon-Free Legislation. On February 7, 2023, the Minnesota Governor signed into law legislation that updates the state s renewable energy standard and requires Minnesota electric utilities to source retail sales with 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2040. The law increases the renewable energy standard from 25 percent renewable by 2025 to 55 percent renewable by 2035, and requires investor-owned Minnesota utilities to provide 80 percent carbon-free energy by 2030, 90 percent carbon-free energy by 2035 and 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2040. The law utilizes renewable energy credits as the means to demonstrate compliance with both the carbon-free and renewable standards, includes an off-ramp provision that enables the MPUC to protect reliability and customer costs through modification or delay of either the renewable energy standard, the carbon-free standard, or both, and streamlines development and construction of wind energy projects and transmission in Minnesota. The Company is evaluating the law to identify challenges and opportunities it could present. 

Regulated Operations. Minnesota Power s long-term strategy is to be the leading electric energy provider in northeastern Minnesota by providing safe, reliable and cost-competitive electric energy, while complying with environmental permit conditions and renewable energy requirements. Keeping the cost of energy production competitive enables Minnesota Power to effectively compete in the wholesale power markets and minimizes retail rate increases to help maintain customer viability. As part of maintaining cost competitiveness, Minnesota Power intends to reduce its exposure to possible future carbon and GHG legislation by reshaping its generation portfolio, over time, to reduce its reliance on coal. Minnesota Power has a goal of delivering 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2050. (See EnergyForward .) We will monitor and review proposed environmental regulations and may challenge those that add considerable cost with limited environmental benefit. Minnesota Power will continue to pursue customer growth opportunities and cost recovery rider approvals for transmission, renewable and environmental investments, as well as work with regulators to earn a fair rate of return. 

Regulatory Matters. Entities within our Regulated Operations segment are under the jurisdiction of the MPUC, FERC, PSCW and NDPSC. See Note 4. Regulatory Matters for discussion of regulatory matters within these jurisdictions. 
 
 2022 Minnesota General Rate Case . On November 1, 2021, Minnesota Power filed a retail rate increase request with the MPUC seeking an average increase of approximately 18 percent for retail customers. The rate filing seeks a return on equity of 10.25 percent and a 53.81 percent equity ratio. On an annualized basis, the requested final rate increase would generate approximately 108 million in additional revenue. In orders dated December 30, 2021, the MPUC accepted the filing as complete and authorized an annual interim rate increase beginning January 1, 2022, with approximately 80 million expected to be collected in cash and approximately 8 million of interim rates for residential customers deferred with a final determination on recovery at the end of the rate case.

Outlook (Continued) 
 Regulatory Matters (Continued) 
 
 At a hearing on January 23, 2023, the MPUC made determinations regarding Minnesota Power s general rate case including allowing a return on common equity of 9.65 percent and a 52.50 percent equity ratio. Upon commencement of final rates, we expect additional revenue from base rates of approximately 60 million and an additional 10 million in revenue recognized under cost recovery riders on an annualized basis, subject to final written order and reconsideration. Final rates are expected to commence in the third quarter of 2023; interim rates will be collected through this period with reserves recorded as necessary. As a result of the MPUC s determinations made on January 23, 2023, Minnesota Power has recorded a reserve for an interim rate refund of approximately 18 million pre-tax as of December 31, 2022, which is subject to MPUC approval of Minnesota Power s refund calculation. In addition, Minnesota Power recorded a charge of approximately 8 million pre-tax to write-off the deferred portion of residential customer interim rates. Minnesota Power also recorded additional revenue of approximately 9 million pre-tax for an increase in expected recoveries under its cost recovery riders. Minnesota Power plans to file its next rate case in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 
 Minnesota Power Land Sales . In August 2020, Minnesota Power filed a petition with the MPUC for approval to sell land that surrounds several reservoirs on its hydroelectric system and is no longer required to maintain its operations. The land has an estimated value of approximately 100 million, and Minnesota Power proposed to credit ratepayers the net proceeds from the sales in a future rate case or through its renewable resources rider to mitigate future rate increases. In an order dated November 18, 2021, the MPUC authorized the land sales and directed the net proceeds to be refunded to ratepayers subject to certain conditions and required compliance filings. 
 
 2022 Wisconsin General Rate Case. In 2022, SWL P filed a rate increase request with the PSCW seeking an average increase of 3.6 percent for retail customers. The filing sought an overall return on equity of 10.4 percent and a 55 percent equity ratio. On an annualized basis, the requested final rate increase would have generated an estimated 4.3 million in additional revenue. In an order dated December 20, 2022, the PSCW approved an annual increase of 3.3 million reflecting a return on equity of 10.0 percent and 55 percent equity ratio. Final rates went into effect January 1, 2023. 

Industrial Customers and Prospective Additional Load 
 
 Industrial Customers . Electric power is one of several key inputs in the taconite mining, paper, pulp and secondary wood products, pipeline and other industries. Approximately 52 percent of our regulated utility kWh sales in 2022 (47 percent in 2021 and 47 percent in 2020) were made to our industrial customers. We expect industrial sales of approximately 6.5 million MWh in 2023 (6.7 million MWh in 2022 and 7.2 million in 2021). (See Item 1. Business Regulated Operations Electric Sales / Customers.) 
 
 Taconite . Minnesota Power s taconite customers are capable of producing up to approximately 41 million tons of taconite pellets annually. Taconite pellets produced in Minnesota are primarily shipped to North American steel making facilities that are part of the integrated steel industry, which continue to lead the world in environmental performance among steelmaking countries. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, steel production in the U.S. is the most energy efficient of any major steel producing country. Steel produced from these North American facilities is used primarily in the manufacture of automobiles, appliances, tubular applications for all industries, and in the construction industry. Steel is also a critical component of the clean energy transformation underway today. Meeting the demand for more renewable energy and the need for additional infrastructure to transport green energy from the point of generation to the end user both require steel. Historically, less than 10 percent of Minnesota taconite production has been exported outside of North America. 
 
 There has been a general historical correlation between U.S. steel production and Minnesota taconite production. The American Iron and Steel Institute, an association of North American steel producers, reported that U.S. raw steel production operated at approximately 78 percent of capacity in 2022 (82 percent in 2021 and 68 percent in 2020). The World Steel Association, an association of steel producers, national and regional steel industry associations, and steel research institutes representing approximately 85 percent of world steel production, projected U.S. steel consumption in 2023 will increase by approximately 2 percent compared to 2022.

Outlook (Continued) 
 Industrial Customers and Prospective Additional Load (Continued) 
 
 Minnesota Power s taconite customers may experience annual variations in production levels due to such factors as economic conditions, short-term demand changes or maintenance outages. We expect taconite production from our taconite customers of approximately 33 million tons in 2023. We estimate that a one million ton change in Minnesota Power s taconite customers production would impact our annual earnings per share by approximately 0.04, net of expected power marketing sales at current prices. Changes in wholesale electric prices or customer contractual demand nominations could impact this estimate. Minnesota Power proactively sells power in the wholesale power markets that is temporarily not required by industrial customers to optimize the value of its generating facilities. Long-term reductions in taconite production or a permanent shut down of a taconite customer may lead Minnesota Power to file a general rate case to recover lost revenue. 
 
 USS Corporation . USS Corporation has announced plans to invest approximately 150 million to construct a system dedicated to producing direct reduced-grade (DR-grade) pellets at its Keetac plant. USS Corporation broke ground on the project in the third quarter of 2022, which is expected to be completed and producing DR-grade pellets in 2024. This will enable the existing pelletizing plant to not only create DR-grade pellets for use as a feedstock for a direct reduced iron (DRI) or hot briquetted iron (HBI) process that ultimately supplies electric arc furnace steelmaking but also maintains the optionality to continue producing blast furnace-grade pellets. USS Corporation s Minntac and Keetac plants are large power industrial customers of Minnesota Power. USS Corporation has the capability to produce approximately 15 million and 5 million tons annually at its Minntac and Keetac plants, respectively. 
 
 Cleveland-Cliffs, Inc. (Cliffs) . In 2020, Cliffs announced that it had completed the previously announced acquisition of substantially all of the operations of ArcelorMittal USA LLC and its subsidiaries. Cliffs had stated that upon closure of the acquisition, Cliffs would be the largest flat-rolled steel producer and the largest iron ore pellet producer in North America. The acquisition included ArcelorMittal s Minorca mine in Virginia, Minnesota, and its ownership share of Hibbing Taconite in Hibbing, Minnesota, which are both large industrial customers of Minnesota Power. Cliffs is Minnesota Power s largest customer. The acquisition has increased customer concentration risk for the Company and could lead to further capacity consolidation for both steel blast furnaces and related Minnesota iron ore production. 
 
 Cliffs completed construction of a hot briquetted iron production plant in Toledo, Ohio, in 2020, which has utilized direct reduced-grade pellets from Northshore Mining. In October 2021, Cliffs indicated it plans to move direct reduced-grade pellet production to its Minorca mine and that Northshore Mining would become a swing facility due to the higher royalty rates at that mine. (See Northshore Mining.). 
 
 Northshore Mining . On February 11, 2022, Cliffs announced that with the use of additional scrap in its basic oxygen furnaces, its iron ore needs are not as high as before. In determining where to adjust production, Cliffs decided to idle all production at its Northshore mine until at least April 2023. Cliffs has also indicated that going forward it will be limiting the tonnage of iron ore pellets sold to third parties. Northshore Mining has the capability to produce approximately 6 million tons annually. Minnesota Power has a PSA through 2031 with Silver Bay Power, which provides the majority of the electric service requirements for Northshore Mining. (See Cliffs.) 
 
 Silver Bay Power . In 2016, Minnesota Power and Silver Bay Power entered into a PSA through 2031. Silver Bay Power supplies approximately 90 MW of load to Northshore Mining, an affiliate of Silver Bay Power, which had previously been served predominately through self-generation by Silver Bay Power. Starting in 2016, Minnesota Power supplied Silver Bay Power with at least 50 MW of energy and Silver Bay Power had the option to purchase additional energy from Minnesota Power as it transitioned away from self-generation. In 2019, Silver Bay Power ceased self-generation and Minnesota Power began supplying the full energy requirements for Silver Bay Power. 
 
 Hibbing Taconite. Hibbing Taconite is a joint venture between subsidiaries of Cliffs (85.3 percent ownership) and USS Corporation (14.7 percent ownership). The joint venture is managed by Cliffs and is also a Large Power Customer of Minnesota Power. Hibbing Taconite has the capability of producing 8 million tons of taconite annually. Hibbing Taconite has proven mineral reserves to support its operations through 2026; and is actively seeking additional mineral reserves to operate beyond its currently stated mine life.

 Industrial Customers and Prospective Additional Load (Continued) 
 
 Minnesota Sulfate Wild Rice Water Quality Standard . On April 29, 2021, the EPA identified rivers and lakes in Minnesota in which wild rice grows that have sulfate levels that exceed Minnesota s sulfate limit for wild rice waters. On September 1, 2021, three additional wild rice waters with sulfate levels that exceed Minnesota s sulfate limit were identified. The EPA directed the MPCA to add these rivers and lakes to its list of impaired waters which can be used to set limits in discharge permits for industrial activities such as mining. Minnesota Power s taconite customers could be adversely impacted if they are required to significantly reduce sulfate discharges. 
 
 Paper, Pulp and Secondary Wood Products . The North American paper and pulp industry continues to face declining demand due to the impact of electronic substitution for print and changing customer needs. As a result, certain paper and pulp customers have reduced their existing operations in recent years and have pursued or are pursuing product changes in response to the declining demand. The resulting reduction in production capacity outside of Minnesota for certain paper grades has solidified our paper customers operations, at least for the near term, and as such we expect operating levels in 2023 at the major paper and pulp mills we serve to be at similar levels as in 2022. 
 
 ST Paper . In May 2021, ST Paper announced it had completed the purchase of the Duluth Mill from Verso Corporation. ST Paper is completing a project at the Duluth Mill to produce tissue. In January 2022, Minnesota Power entered into an electric service agreement with ST Paper that would begin Large Power Customer service with a minimum term of six years upon start-up of operations, which is anticipated in 2023. A petition for approval of the electric service agreement was approved by the MPUC in May 2022. Upon start-up of operations, ST Paper will become a Large Power Customer as we expect to serve requirements of at least 10 MW of customer load. 
 
 Pipeline and Other Industries. 
 
 Cenovus Energy . In 2018, a fire at Cenovus Energy s refinery in Superior, Wisconsin, which was owned by Husky Energy at that time, disrupted operations at the facility. Under normal operating conditions, SWL P provides approximately 14 MW of average monthly demand to the refinery in addition to water service. The facility remains at minimal operations, and the refinery is expected to resume normal operations in 2023. 
 
 Prospective Additional Load. Minnesota Power is pursuing new wholesale and retail loads in and around its service territory. Currently, several companies in northeastern Minnesota continue to progress in the development of natural resource-based projects that represent long-term growth potential and load diversity for Minnesota Power. We cannot predict the outcome of these projects. 

EnergyForward. Minnesota Power is executing EnergyForward , its strategy assuring reliability, protecting affordability and further improving environmental performance. The plan includes completed and planned investments in wind, solar, natural gas and hydroelectric power, construction of additional transmission capacity, the installation of emissions control technology and the idling and retirement of certain coal-fired generating facilities. Minnesota Power has a vision to deliver 100 percent carbon-free energy to customers by 2050, continuing its commitment to climate, customers and communities through its EnergyForward strategy. This vision builds on Minnesota Power s recent achievement of now providing 50 percent renewable energy to its customers. 
 
 2021 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). On February 1, 2021, Minnesota Power filed its latest IRP, which was approved by the MPUC in an order dated January 9, 2023. The approved IRP, which reflects a joint agreement reached with various stakeholders, outlines Minnesota Power s clean-energy transition plans through 2035. These plans include expanding its renewable energy supply, achieving coal-free operations at its facilities by 2035, and investing in a resilient and flexible transmission and distribution grid. As part of these plans, Minnesota Power anticipates adding up to 700 MW of new wind and solar energy resources, and ceasing coal operations at Boswell Units 3 and 4 by 2030 and 2035, respectively. Minnesota Power s plans recognize that advances in technology will play a significant role in completing its transition to carbon-free energy supply, reliably and affordably. Minnesota Power is expected to file its next IRP by March 1, 2025. 
 
 In recent years, Minnesota Power has transformed its energy supply from more than a 95 percent reliance on coal to become a leader in the nation s clean-energy transformation. Since 2013, the company has closed or converted seven of its nine coal-fired units and added nearly 900 megawatts of renewable energy sources. Additionally, Minnesota Power has been a leader in energy conservation, surpassing the state s conservation goals each year for the past decade.

 Nemadji Trail Energy Center (NTEC). In 2017, Minnesota Power submitted a resource package to the MPUC which included requesting approval of a natural gas capacity dedication and other affiliated-interest agreements for NTEC, an approximately 600 MW proposed combined-cycle natural gas-fired generating facility to be built in Superior, Wisconsin, which will be jointly owned by Dairyland Power Cooperative, Basin and South Shore Energy, ALLETE s non-rate regulated, Wisconsin subsidiary. Minnesota Power is expected to purchase approximately 20 percent of the facility's output starting in 2025 pursuant to the capacity dedication agreement. 

Renewable Energy. Minnesota Power continues to execute its renewable energy strategy and recently reached its goal of supplying 50 percent of its energy by renewable energy sources. Minnesota Power also has a goal of delivering 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2050. (See EnergyForward .) 
 
 Minnesota Power has approved cost recovery riders for certain renewable investments and expenditures as well as investments and expenditures related to compliance with the Minnesota Solar Energy Standard. The cost recovery riders allow Minnesota Power to charge retail customers on a current basis for the costs of certain renewable and solar investments and expenditures plus a return on the capital invested. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.) 
 
 Wind Energy . Minnesota Power s wind energy facilities consist of Bison (497 MW) located in North Dakota, and Taconite Ridge (25 MW) located in northeastern Minnesota. Minnesota Power also has two long-term wind energy PPAs with an affiliate of NextEra Energy, Inc. to purchase the output from Oliver Wind I (50 MW) and Oliver Wind II (48 MW) located in North Dakota. 
 
 Minnesota Power uses the 465-mile, 250-kV DC transmission line that runs from Center, North Dakota, to Duluth, Minnesota, to transport wind energy from North Dakota while gradually phasing out coal-based electricity delivered to its system over this transmission line from Square Butte s lignite coal-fired generating unit. Minnesota Power is currently pursuing a modernization and capacity upgrade of its DC transmission system to continue providing reliable operations and additional system capabilities. 
 
 Nobles 2 PPA . Minnesota Power has a long-term PPA with Nobles 2 that provides for Minnesota Power to purchase the energy and associated capacity from a 250 MW wind energy facility in southwestern Minnesota through 2040. The agreement provides for the purchase of output from the facility at fixed energy prices. There are no fixed capacity charges, and Minnesota Power will only pay for energy as it is delivered. (See Corporate and Other Investment in Nobles 2 .) 
 
 Manitoba Hydro . Minnesota Power has two long-term PPAs with Manitoba Hydro. The first PPA provides for Minnesota Power to purchase 250 MW of capacity and energy from Manitoba Hydro through May 2035. The second PPA provides for Minnesota Power to purchase up to 133 MW of energy from Manitoba Hydro through June 2040. (See Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.) 
 
 Solar Energy . Minnesota Power s solar energy supply consists of Camp Ripley, a 10 MW solar energy facility at the Camp Ripley Minnesota Army National Guard base and training facility near Little Falls, Minnesota, and a community solar garden in northeastern Minnesota, which is comprised of a 1 MW solar array owned and operated by a third party with the output purchased by Minnesota Power and a 40 kW solar array that is owned and operated by Minnesota Power. SWL P also plans to construct a 470 kW solar array in 2023 as part of a community solar garden in Superior, Wisconsin, which was approved by the PSCW in October 2020. 
 
 In June 2020, Minnesota Power filed a proposal with the MPUC to accelerate its plans for purchasing solar energy from approximately MW of solar energy projects in Minnesota which was approved in a June 2021 order. These solar energy projects will be constructed and owned through an ALLETE subsidiary with an estimated investment of million. Construction of these solar energy projects commenced in 2022 and will be operational in 2023. 

Transmission . We continue to make investments in transmission opportunities that strengthen or enhance the transmission grid or take advantage of our geographical location between sources of renewable energy and end users. These include the GNTL, investments to enhance our own transmission facilities, investments in other transmission assets (individually or in combination with others) and our investment in ATC.

Outlook (Continued) 
 Transmission (Continued) 
 
 North Plains Connector Development Agreement. ALLETE and Grid United LLC, an independent transmission company, have signed a memorandum of understanding to explore transmission opportunities, with plans to execute a North Plains Connector development agreement in the first half of 2023. The project is a new, approximately 385-mile high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission line from central North Dakota, to Colstrip, Montana that will be the first transmission connection between three regional U.S. electric energy markets MISO, the Western Interconnection and the Southwest Power Pool. This new link, open to all sources of electric generation, would create 3,000 MW of transfer capacity between the middle of the country and the West Coast, easing congestion on the transmission system, increasing resiliency and reliability in all three energy markets, and enabling fast sharing of renewable energy across a vast area with diverse weather patterns. The project is expected to cost approximately 2.5 billion. ALLETE expects to pursue at least 35 percent ownership and would oversee the line s operation. The companies expect project permitting to start in 2023 as they work toward an in-service date of 2029, pending regulatory approvals. 
 
 Duluth Loop Reliability Project . On October 21, 2021, Minnesota Power submitted an application for a certificate of need for the Duluth Loop Reliability Project. This transmission project was proposed to enhance reliability in and around Duluth, Minnesota. The project includes the construction of a new 115-kV transmission line; construction of an approximately one-mile extension of an existing 230-kV transmission line; and upgrades to several substations. A certificate of need and route permit are expected in first quarter of 2023. The Duluth Loop Reliability Project is expected to be completed and in service by 2025, subject to MPUC approval, with an estimated cost of 50 million to 70 million. 
 
 MISO Long Range Transmission Plan . Minnesota Power and Great River Energy announced on July 25, 2022, their intent to build a 150-mile, 345-kV transmission line, connecting northern Minnesota to central Minnesota to support continued reliability in the Upper Midwest. Great River Energy, a wholesale electric power cooperative, and Minnesota Power filed a Notice of Intent to Construct, Own and Maintain the transmission line with the MPUC on August 1, 2022. This joint project is part of a portfolio of transmission projects approved on July 25, 2022, by MISO, as part of the first phase of its Long Range Transmission Plan. Planning for the 970 million transmission line is in its early stages with the route anticipated to generally follow existing rights of way in an established power line corridor. The two utilities expect to seek a combined Certificate of Need and Route Permit from the MPUC. The MPUC will determine the final route as well as cost recovery for Minnesota Power s approximately 50 percent estimated share of the project. Subject to regulatory approvals, the transmission line is expected to be in service in 2030. 
 
 Investment in ATC. ATC s most recent 10-year transmission assessment, which covers the years 2022 through 2031, identifies a need for between 5.1 billion and 6.2 billion in transmission system investments. These investments by ATC, if undertaken, are expected to be funded through a combination of internally generated cash, debt and investor contributions. As opportunities arise, we plan to make additional investments in ATC through general capital calls based upon our pro rata ownership interest in ATC. 

ALLETE Clean Energy. 
 
 ALLETE Clean Energy will pursue growth through acquisitions or project development. ALLETE Clean Energy is targeting acquisitions of existing operating portfolios which have a mix of long-term PSAs in place and/or available for repowering and recontracting. Further, ALLETE Clean Energy will evaluate actions that will lead to the addition of complimentary clean energy products and services. At this time, ALLETE Clean Energy is focused on actions that will optimize its clean energy project portfolio of operating and development projects, which may include recontracting, repowering, entering into partnerships and divestitures along with continued acquisitions or development of new projects including wind, solar, energy storage or storage ready facilities across North America. 
 
 Portions of our ALLETE Clean Energy business are experiencing return pressures that are impacting our earnings per share growth from increased competition, and lower forward price curves, as a growing amount of investment capital is being directed into wind generation opportunities. In addition, current and potential new project developments can be negatively affected by a lower ALLETE stock price, which may result in such projects not being accretive, or otherwise unable to satisfy our financial objectives criteria to proceed. In response to these market pressures, we are actively evaluating additional growth opportunities to deliver more comprehensive clean energy solutions for customers at ALLETE Clean Energy, which may include wind, solar, storage solutions, and related energy infrastructure investments and services. We believe that the renewable energy industry is entering a new phase of growth and that we are well-positioned to serve customers and drive future growth at ALLETE. ALLETE Clean Energy will continue to optimize its existing wind energy facility portfolio, seek development of its remaining safe harbor inventory of tax credit qualified turbines, and explore other renewable energy opportunities to expand its service offerings to further enhance its growth and profitability.

 ALLETE Clean Energy (Continued) 
 
 In May 2021, ALLETE Clean Energy announced that it acquired the rights to the approximately 92 MW Red Barn wind development project and the approximately 68 MW Whitetail renewable development project in southwestern Wisconsin. ALLETE Clean Energy also signed an asset sale agreement for the completed Red Barn wind project with Wisconsin Public Service Corporation and Madison Gas and Electric Company. At a hearing in January 2022, the PSCW approved the sale of the Red Barn wind project, which is expected to close in 2023, subject to completion of construction and receipt of permits. 
 
 ALLETE Clean Energy manages risk by having a diverse portfolio of assets, which includes PSA expiration, technology and geographic diversity. The current operating portfolio is subject to typical variations in seasonal wind with higher wind resources typically available in the winter months. The majority of its planned maintenance leverages this seasonality and is performed during lower wind periods. ALLETE Clean Energy s current operating portfolio is as follows: 
 
 Region Wind Energy Facility Capacity MW PSA MW PSA Expiration East Armenia Mountain 101 100 2024 Midwest Lake Benton 104 100 2028 Storm Lake I 108 100 2027 Storm Lake II 77 Merchant 90 n/a PSA 1 10 2032 Other 17 100 2028 South Caddo 303 Merchant 27 n/a PSA 1 66 2034 PSA 2 7 2034 Diamond Spring 303 PSA 1 58 2035 PSA 2 25 2032 PSA 3 16 2035 West Condon 50 100 (a) Glen Ullin 106 100 2039 South Peak 80 100 2035 
 (a) The PSA for Condon expired in 2022, and Condon is currently selling energy pursuant to a month-to-month agreement while the parties negotiate an agreement on a new PSA. 
 
 Non-cash amortization to revenue recognized by ALLETE Clean Energy relates to the amortization of differences between contract prices and estimated market prices on assumed PSAs. As part of wind energy facility acquisitions, ALLETE Clean Energy assumed various PSAs that were above or below estimated market prices at the time of acquisition; the resulting differences between contract prices and estimated market prices are amortized to revenue over the remaining PSA term. Non-cash amortization is expected to be approximately 5 million in 2023, 6 million annually in 2024 through 2027, and decreasing thereafter through 2032.

 South Shore Energy. South Shore Energy, ALLETE s non-rate regulated, Wisconsin subsidiary, is developing NTEC, an approximately 600 MW proposed combined-cycle natural gas-fired generating facility to be built in Superior, Wisconsin, which will be jointly owned by Dairyland Power Cooperative, Basin and South Shore Energy. Minnesota Power is expected to purchase approximately 20 percent of the facility's output starting in 2027 pursuant to a capacity dedication agreement. Construction of NTEC is subject to obtaining additional permits from local, state and federal authorities. The total project cost is estimated to be approximately 700 million, of which South Shore Energy s portion is expected to be approximately 150 million. South Shore Energy s portion of NTEC project costs incurred through December 31, 2022, is approximately 7 million. 

BNI Energy. In 2022, BNI Energy sold 3.7 million tons of coal (3.9 million tons in 2021) and anticipates 2023 sales will be higher than 2022. BNI Energy operates under cost-plus fixed fee agreements extending through December 31, 2037. 

ALLETE Properties. Our strategy incorporates the possibility of a bulk sale of the entire ALLETE Properties portfolio. Proceeds from a bulk sale would be strategically deployed to support growth initiatives at our Regulated Operations and ALLETE Clean Energy. ALLETE Properties also continues to pursue sales of individual parcels over time and will continue to maintain key entitlements and infrastructure. 

Income Taxes 
 
 ALLETE s aggregate federal and multi-state statutory tax rate is approximately 28 percent for 2022. ALLETE also has tax credits and other tax adjustments that reduce the combined statutory rate to the effective tax rate. These tax credits and adjustments historically have included items such as production tax credits, excess deferred taxes, non-controlling interests in subsidiaries, as well as other items. The annual effective rate can also be impacted by such items as changes in income before income taxes, state and federal tax law changes that become effective during the year, business combinations, tax planning initiatives and resolution of prior years tax matters. We expect our effective tax rate to be a benefit of approximately 5 percent for 2023 primarily due to federal production tax credits as a result of wind energy generation and non-controlling interests in subsidiaries. We also expect that our effective tax rate will be lower than the combined statutory rate over the next 10 years due to production tax credits attributable to our wind energy generation.

We also have other credit facility agreements in place that provide the ability to issue up to 252.0 million in standby letters of credit. As of December 31, 2022, we had 245.4 million outstanding in standby letters of credit under these agreements. 
 
 In addition, as of December 31, 2022, we had 2.9 million original issue shares of our common stock available for issuance through Invest Direct and 2.1 million original issue shares of common stock available for issuance through a distribution agreement with Lampert Capital Markets. (See Securities. The amount and timing of future sales of our securities will depend upon market conditions and our specific needs. 

Securities . We entered into a distribution agreement with Lampert Capital Markets, in 2008, as amended most recently in 2020, with respect to the issuance and sale of up to an aggregate of 13.6 million shares of our common stock, without par value, of which 2.1 million shares remain available for issuance as of December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, no shares of common stock were issued under this agreement (0.8 million shares for net proceeds of 51.0 million in 2021; none in 2020). 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we issued 0.3 million shares of common stock through Invest Direct, the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the Retirement Savings and Stock Ownership Plan, resulting in net proceeds of 16.2 million (0.3 million shares for net proceeds of 18.9 million in 2021; 0.4 million shares for net proceeds of 18.1 million in 2020). See Note 10. Common Stock and Earnings Per Share for additional detail regarding ALLETE s equity securities. 
 
 On April 5, 2022, ALLETE issued and sold approximately 3.7 million shares of ALLETE common stock. Net proceeds of approximately 224 million were received from the sale of shares. Proceeds were used primarily to fund the acquisition of New Energy and capital investments at ALLETE Clean Energy. 

Financial Covenants . See Note 8. Short-Term and Long-Term Debt for information regarding our financial covenants. 
 
 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. Management considers various factors when making funding decisions, such as regulatory requirements, actuarially determined minimum contribution requirements and contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions for the defined benefit pension plans. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we made no contributions to the defined benefit pension plans. On January 17, 2023, we contributed 6.5 million in cash to the defined benefit pension plans. We do not expect to make any further contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2023, and we do not expect to make any contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2023. (See Note 10. Common Stock and Earnings Per Share and Note 12. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans.) 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements . Off-balance sheet arrangements are discussed in Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies. 

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments . ALLETE has contractual obligations and other commitments that will need to be funded in the future, in addition to its capital expenditure programs. Material contractual obligations and other commitments are as follows: 
 
 Long-Term Debt. ALLETE has material long-term debt obligations, including long-term debt due within one year. These obligations include the principal amount of bonds, notes and loans which are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, plus interest. (See Note 8. Short-Term and Long Term Debt.) 
 
 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. Pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations include the current estimate of future benefit payments. Pension contributions are dependent on several factors including realized asset performance, future discount rate and other actuarial assumptions, Internal Revenue Service and other regulatory requirements, and contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions for the pension plans. Funding for the other postretirement benefit plans is impacted by realized asset performance, future discount rate and other actuarial assumptions, and utility regulatory requirements. Our obligations are estimates and will change based on actual market performance, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations. (See Note 12. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans.)

Liquidity and Capital Resources (Continued) 
 
 Operating Lease Obligations . ALLETE has certain operating lease obligations for the minimum payments required under various lease agreements which are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. (See Note 1. Operations and Significant Accounting Policies.) 
 
 Easement Obligations . ALLETE has easement obligations for the minimum payments required under our land easement agreements at our wind energy facilities. (See Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.) 
 
 PPA Obligations. PPA obligations represent our Square Butte, Manitoba Hydro and other PPAs. (See Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.) 
 
 Other Purchase Obligations. ALLETE has other purchase obligations covering our minimum purchase commitments under coal supply and rail contracts, and long-term service agreements for wind energy facilities. (See Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.) 

Credit Ratings . Access to reasonably priced capital markets is dependent in part on credit and ratings. Our securities have been rated by S P and by Moody s. Rating agencies use both quantitative and qualitative measures in determining a company s credit rating. These measures include business risk, liquidity risk, competitive position, capital mix, financial condition, predictability of cash flows, management strength and future direction. Some of the quantitative measures can be analyzed through a few key financial ratios, while the qualitative ones are more subjective. Our current credit ratings are listed in the following table: 
 
 Credit Ratings S P Moody s Issuer Credit Rating BBB Baa1 Commercial Paper A-2 P-2 First Mortgage Bonds (a) A2 
 (a) Not rated by S P. 
 
 The disclosure of these credit ratings is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our securities. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 

Common Stock Dividends . ALLETE is committed to providing a competitive dividend to its shareholders while at the same time funding its growth. ALLETE s long-term objective is to maintain a dividend payout ratio similar to our peers and provide for future dividend increases. Our targeted payout range is between 60 percent and 70 percent. In 2022, we paid out 77 percent (78 percent in 2021; 78 percent in 2020) of our per share earnings in dividends. On February 3, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of 0.6775 per share, which is payable on March 1, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 15, 2023.

Capital Requirements 
 
 ALLETE s projected capital expenditures for the years 2023 through 2027 are presented in the following table. Actual capital expenditures may vary from the projections due to changes in forecasted plant maintenance, regulatory decisions or approvals, future environmental requirements, base load growth, capital market conditions or executions of new business strategies. Projected capital expenditures exclude amounts for projects that will be sold to third parties upon completion.

 (a) These capital expenditures are part of Minnesota Power s clean-energy transition plans, which include its vision to deliver 100 percent carbon-free energy to customers by 2050, as detailed in Minnesota Power s latest IRP, which was approved by the MPUC in January 2023. These capital expenditures are dependent on successful requests for proposal by Minnesota Power. (See Outlook EnergyForward.) 
 (b) Capital expenditures in 2023 do not include costs related to ALLETE Clean Energy s project to develop and sell the 92 MW Red Barn project as these projects will be sold upon completion. (See Outlook ALLETE Clean Energy.) 
 (c) Our portion of estimated capital expenditures for construction of NTEC, an approximately 600 MW proposed combined-cycle natural gas-fired generating facility to be built in Superior, Wisconsin, which will be jointly owned by Dairyland Power Cooperative, Basin and South Shore Energy. 
 (d) These amounts do not include any capital expenditures related to the North Plains Connector Development Agreement. (See Outlook Transmission.) 
 
 We are well positioned to meet our financing needs due to adequate operating cash flows, available additional working capital and access to capital markets. We will finance capital expenditures from a combination of internally generated funds, debt and equity issuance proceeds. We intend to maintain a capital structure with capital ratios near current levels. (See Capital Structure. 

Environmental and Other Matters 
 
 Our businesses are subject to regulation of environmental matters by various federal, state and local authorities. A number of regulatory changes to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and various waste management requirements have been promulgated by both the EPA and state authorities over the past several years. Minnesota Power s facilities are subject to additional requirements under many of these regulations. Minnesota Power is reshaping its generation portfolio, over time, to reduce its reliance on coal, has installed cost-effective emission control technology, and advocates for sound science and policy during rulemaking implementation. (See Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.) 

Market Risk 
 
 Securities Investments. 
 
 Available-for-Sale Securities. As of December 31, 2022, our available-for-sale securities portfolio consisted primarily of securities held in other postretirement plans to fund employee benefits.

Market Risk (Continued) 
 
 INTEREST RATE RISK 
 
 We are exposed to risks resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable rate debt. We manage our interest rate risk by varying the issuance and maturity dates of our fixed rate debt, limiting the amount of variable rate debt, and continually monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. We may also enter into derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to mitigate interest rate exposure. The following table presents the long-term debt obligations and the corresponding weighted average interest rate as of December 31, 2022: 
 
 Expected Maturity Date Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total Fair Value Long-Term Debt Fixed Rate Millions 91.9 87.3 216.1 79.4 81.7 1,154.4 1,710.8 1,564.4 Average Interest Rate 5.9 4.4 3.4 3.4 5.7 4.0 4.1 Variable Rate Millions 7.5 170.0 40.8 218.3 218.3 Average Interest Rate 7.8 4.8 4.2 4.8 
 
 Interest rates on variable rate long-term debt are reset on a periodic basis reflecting prevailing market conditions. Based on the variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would impact the amount of pre-tax interest expense by 2.2 million. This amount was determined by considering the impact of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase to the average variable interest rate on the variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 COMMODITY PRICE RISK 
 
 Our regulated utility operations incur costs for power and fuel (primarily coal and related transportation) in Minnesota, and power and natural gas purchased for resale in our regulated service territory in Wisconsin. Minnesota Power s exposure to price risk for these commodities is significantly mitigated by the current ratemaking process and regulatory framework, which allows recovery of fuel costs in excess of those included in base rates or distribution of savings in fuel costs to ratepayers. SWL P s exposure to price risk for natural gas is significantly mitigated by the current ratemaking process and regulatory framework, which allows the commodity cost to be passed through to customers. We seek to prudently manage our customers exposure to price risk by entering into contracts of various durations and terms for the purchase of power and coal and related transportation costs (Minnesota Power) and natural gas (SWL P). 
 
 POWER MARKETING 
 
 Minnesota Power s power marketing activities consist of: (1) purchasing energy in the wholesale market to serve its regulated service territory when energy requirements exceed generation output; and (2) selling excess available energy and purchased power. From time to time, Minnesota Power may have excess energy that is temporarily not required by retail and municipal customers in our regulated service territory. Minnesota Power actively sells any excess energy to the wholesale market to optimize the value of its generating facilities. 
 
 We are exposed to credit risk primarily through our power marketing activities. We use credit policies to manage credit risk, which includes utilizing an established credit approval process and monitoring counterparty limits.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, evaluations were performed, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, on the effectiveness of the design and operation of ALLETE s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act). Based upon those evaluations, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide assurance that information required to be disclosed in ALLETE s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the Internal Control Integrated Framework (framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. 
 
 On April 15, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of New Energy. As a result, management has excluded New Energy from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting. New Energy is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues represent 1 percent and 5 percent, respectively, of the related Consolidated Financial Statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 Changes in Internal Controls 
 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of ALLETE, Inc. 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of ALLETE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 As described in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded New Energy from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2022. We have also excluded New Energy from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. New Energy is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent 1 and 5 , respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
 ALLETE, Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 
 67 

expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Accounting for the Effects of Regulatory Matters 
 As described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s regulated utility operations are subject to accounting standards for the effects of certain types of regulation. As of December 31, 2022, there was 467 million of regulatory assets and 550 million of regulatory liabilities recorded. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred as they are probable for recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities represent obligations to make refunds to customers and amounts collected in rates for which the related costs have not yet been incurred. Management assesses quarterly whether regulatory assets and liabilities meet the criteria for probability of future recovery or deferral. As disclosed by management, these standards require the Company to reflect the effect of regulatory decisions in its financial statements. This assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment and recent rate orders to other regulated entities under the same jurisdiction. If future recovery or refund of costs becomes no longer probable, the assets and liabilities would be recognized in current period net income or other comprehensive income. 
 The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Company s accounting for the effects of regulatory matters is a critical audit matter is the significant judgment by management in determining the recoverability of costs; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the recoverability of costs. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s implementation of new regulatory orders, changes to existing regulatory orders, and assessing the recoverability of costs. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating (i) the reasonableness of management s assessment of impacts arising from correspondence with regulators and changes in laws and regulations, (ii) management s judgments related to the recoverability of regulatory assets and the establishment of regulatory liabilities, and (iii) the sufficiency of the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Testing the regulatory assets and liabilities involved considering the provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders, other regulatory correspondence, and application of relevant regulatory precedents.

 Business Segments. reportable segments: Regulated Operations and ALLETE Clean Energy. Our segments were determined in accordance with the guidance on segment reporting. We measure performance of our operations through budgeting and monitoring of contributions to consolidated net income by each business segment. 
 
 Regulated Operations includes our regulated utilities, Minnesota Power and SWL P, as well as our investment in ATC, a Wisconsin-based regulated utility that owns and maintains electric transmission assets in portions of Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois. Minnesota Power provides regulated utility electric service in northeastern Minnesota to approximately retail customers. Minnesota Power also has non-affiliated municipal customers in Minnesota. SWL P is a Wisconsin utility and a wholesale customer of Minnesota Power. SWL P provides regulated utility electric, natural gas and water service in northwestern Wisconsin to approximately electric customers, natural gas customers and water customers. Our regulated utility operations include retail and wholesale activities under the jurisdiction of state and federal regulatory authorities . 
 
 ALLETE Clean Energy focuses on developing, acquiring, and operating clean and renewable energy projects. ALLETE Clean Energy currently owns and operates, in seven states, more than MW of nameplate capacity wind energy generation with a majority contracted under PSAs of various durations. In addition, ALLETE Clean Energy also engages in the development of wind energy facilities to operate under long-term PSAs or for sale to others upon completion.

 South Shore Energy, ALLETE s non-rate regulated, Wisconsin subsidiary, is developing NTEC, an approximately MW proposed combined-cycle natural gas-fired generating facility to be built in Superior, Wisconsin, which will be jointly owned by Dairyland Power Cooperative, Basin and South Shore Energy. Minnesota Power is expected to purchase approximately percent of the facility's output starting in 2027 pursuant to a capacity dedication agreement. Construction of NTEC is subject to obtaining additional permits from local, state and federal authorities. The total project cost is estimated to be approximately million, of which South Shore Energy s portion is expected to be approximately million. South Shore Energy s portion of NTEC project costs incurred through December 31, 2022, is approximately million. 
 
 BNI Energy mines and sells lignite coal to North Dakota mine-mouth generating units, of which is Square Butte. In 2022, Square Butte supplied percent MW) of its output to Minnesota Power under long-term contracts. (See Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.) 
 
 ALLETE Properties represents our legacy Florida real estate investment. Our strategy incorporates the possibility of a bulk sale of the entire ALLETE Properties portfolio.

 Concentration of Credit Risk. We are subject to concentration of credit risk primarily as a result of accounts receivable. Minnesota Power sells electricity to Large Power Customers. Receivables from these customers totaled million as of December 31, 2022 million as of December 31, 2021). Minnesota Power does not obtain collateral to support utility receivables, but monitors the credit standing of major customers. In addition, Minnesota Power, as permitted by the MPUC, requires its taconite-producing Large Power Customers to pay weekly for electric usage based on monthly energy usage estimates, which allows us to closely manage collection of amounts due. Minnesota Power s taconite customers, which are currently owned by entities at the end of 2022, accounted for approximately percent of Regulated Operations operating revenue and approximately percent of consolidated operating revenue in 2022 percent of Regulated Operations operating revenue and percent of consolidated operating revenue in 2021 and percent of Regulated Operations operating revenue and percent of consolidated operating revenue in 2020).

 million and million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.) Minnesota Power s latest IRP also includes the retirement of Taconite Harbor. As of December 31, 2022, Taconite Harbor had a net book value of approximately million. We do not expect to record any impairment charge as a result of these operating changes at Taconite Harbor and Boswell. In addition, we expect to be able to continue depreciating these assets for at least their established remaining useful lives; however, we are unable to predict the impact of regulatory outcomes resulting in changes to their established remaining useful lives. 
 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. 

ALLETE, Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 
 77 

We continue to monitor changes in the broader energy markets along with wind resource expectations that could indicate impairment at ALLETE Clean Energy wind energy facilities upon contract expirations. A decline in energy prices or lower wind resource expectations could result in a future impairment. 
 
 In 2022 and 2021 there were triggering events that indicated an impairment for our property, plant, and equipment at certain ALLETE Clean Energy wind energy facilities with expiring PSAs for which a recoverability test was performed indicating that the undiscounted cash flows adequately supported the property, plant and equipment book values. As a result, impairment was recorded in 2022 and 2021. In 2020, there were indicators of impairment for ALLETE Clean Energy s Northern Wind project. See Immaterial Revision to Prior Period . 
 
 Immaterial Revision to Prior Period. If the net book value would have been calculated correctly in the recoverability test, an million after-tax impairment expense would have been recognized in the fourth quarter of 2020. We evaluated the effects of this error on our previously-issued consolidated financial statements in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic (ASC) 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, ASC 250-10-S99-1, Assessing Materiality, and ASC 250-10-S99-2, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, and concluded that no prior period is materially misstated. Accordingly, we have revised our consolidated financial statements for the impacted prior periods herein.

 Goodwill. 
 
 As of the date of our annual goodwill impairment testing in 2022, the Company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment of goodwill for impairment, proceeding directly to the two-step impairment test for the New Energy reporting unit. In performing Step 1 of the impairment test, we compared the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill. If the carrying value including goodwill were to exceed the fair value of a reporting unit, Step 2 of the impairment test would be performed. Step 2 of the impairment test requires the carrying value of goodwill to be reduced to its fair value, if lower, as of the test date. 
 
 For Step 1 of the impairment test, we estimated the reporting unit's fair value using standard valuation techniques, including techniques which use estimates of projected future results and cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit. Such techniques generally include a terminal value that utilizes a growth rate on debt-free cash flows. These cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance. Our annual impairment test in 2022 indicated that the estimated fair value of New Energy exceeded its carrying value, and therefore no impairment existed. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow model, using significant assumptions which included a discount rate of percent, cash flow forecasts through 2027, industry average gross margins, and a terminal growth rate of percent.

non-affiliated municipal customers in Minnesota under long-term wholesale electric contracts. One of these wholesale electric contracts include a termination clause requiring a three-year notice to terminate. These contracts have termination dates ranging through 2037, with a majority of contracts expiring in 2029. Performance obligations with these customers are satisfied at the time energy is delivered to an agreed upon municipal substation or meter. 
 
 Industrial includes sales recognized from contracts with customers in the taconite mining, paper, pulp and secondary wood products, pipeline and other industries. Industrial sales accounted for approximately percent of total regulated utility kWh sales for the year ended December 31, 2022. Within industrial revenue, Minnesota Power had Large Power Customer contracts, each serving requirements of MW or more of customer load as of December 31, 2022. These contracts automatically renew past the contract term unless a four -year written notice is given. Large Power Customer contracts have earliest termination dates ranging from 2026 through 2029. We satisfy our performance obligations for these customers at the time energy is delivered to an agreed upon customer substation. Revenue is accrued for energy provided but not yet billed at period end. Based on current contracts with industrial customers, we expect to recognize minimum revenue for the fixed contract components of approximately million per annum through 2026, million in 2027, and million in total thereafter, which reflects the termination notice period in these contracts. When determining minimum revenue, we assume that customer contracts will continue under the contract renewal provision; however, if long-term contracts are renegotiated and subsequently approved by the MPUC or there are changes within our industrial customer class, these amounts may be impacted. Contracts with customers that contain variable pricing or quantity components are excluded from the expected minimum revenue amounts. 
 
 Other Power Suppliers includes the sale of energy under a long-term PSA with customer as well as MISO market and liquidation sales. The expiration date of this PSA is 2028. Performance obligations with these customers are satisfied at the time energy is delivered to an agreed upon delivery point defined in the contract (generally the MISO pricing node). The current contract with customer contains variable pricing components that prevent us from estimating future minimum revenue. 
 
 Other Revenue includes all remaining individually immaterial revenue streams for Minnesota Power and SWL P, and is comprised of steam sales to paper and pulp mills, wheeling revenue and other sources. Revenue for steam sales to customers is recognized at the time steam is delivered and simultaneously consumed. Revenue is recognized at the time each performance obligation is satisfied. 
 
 CIP Financial Incentive months following the end of the annual period in which it is recognized. CIP financial incentives are recognized in the period in which the MPUC approves the filing, which is typically mid-year.

These customers receive estimated bills based on Minnesota Power s estimate of the customers energy usage, forecasted energy prices and fuel adjustment clause estimates. Minnesota Power s taconite-producing Large Power Customers have generally predictable energy usage on a weekly basis and any differences that occur are trued-up the following month. Due to the timing difference of revenue recognition from the timing of invoicing and payment, the taconite-producing Large Power Customers receive credit for the time value of money; however, we have determined that our contracts do not include a significant financing component as the period between when we transfer the service to the customer and when they pay for such service is minimal.

million of assets recognized for costs incurred to obtain contracts with our customers million as of December 31, 2021). Management determined the amount of costs to be recognized as assets based on actual costs incurred and paid to obtain and fulfill these contracts to provide goods and services to our customers. Assets recognized to obtain contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the contract term as a non-cash reduction to revenue. We recognized million of non-cash amortization for the year ended December 31, 2022 million for the year end December 31, 2021). 
 
 Unamortized Discount and Premium on Debt. 
 
 Tax Equity Financings. Certain subsidiaries of ALLETE have entered into tax equity financings that include forming limited liability companies (LLC) with third-party investors for certain wind projects. Tax equity financings have specific terms that dictate distributions of cash and the allocation of tax attributes among the LLC members, who are divided into two categories: the sponsor and third-party investors. ALLETE subsidiaries are the sponsors in these tax equity financings. The distributions of cash and allocation of tax attributes in these financings generally differ from the underlying ownership percentage interests in the related LLC, with a disproportionate share of tax attributes (including accelerated depreciation and production tax credits) allocated to third-party investors in order to achieve targeted after-tax rates of return, or target yield, from project operations, and a disproportionate share of cash distributions made to the sponsor. 
 
 The target yield and other terms vary by tax equity financing. Once the target yield has been achieved, a flip point is recognized. In addition, tax equity financings typically provide that cash distributions can be temporarily increased to the third-party investors in order to meet cumulative distribution thresholds. After the flip point, tax attributes and cash distributions are both typically disproportionately allocated to the sponsor. 
 
 Tax equity financings include affirmative and negative covenants that are similar to what a project lender would require in a project financing, such as financial reporting, insurance, maintenance and prudent operator standards. Most covenants are no longer applicable once the flip point occurs and any other obligations of the third-party investor have been eliminated. 
 
 The third-party investors portions of equity ownership in tax equity LLCs are recorded as non-controlling interest in subsidiaries on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and earnings allocated to third-party investors are recorded as net loss attributable to non-controlling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
 Non-Controlling Interest in Subsidiaries. Non-controlling interest in subsidiaries represents the portion of equity ownership, net income (loss), and comprehensive income (loss) in subsidiaries that is not attributable to equity holders of ALLETE. These amounts as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, related to the tax equity financings for ALLETE Clean Energy s MW Glen Ullin, MW South Peak, MW Diamond Spring and MW Caddo wind energy facilities as well as ALLETE s equity investment in the MW Nobles 2 wind energy facility.

 Income Taxes. 
 
 Due to the effects of regulation on Minnesota Power and SWL P, certain adjustments made to deferred income taxes are, in turn, recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. Tax credits are recorded when earned unless there is a requirement to defer the benefit and amortize it over the book depreciable lives of the related property. The requirement to defer and amortize tax credits only applies to federal credits related to public utility property. In accordance with GAAP for uncertainty in income taxes, we are required to recognize in our financial statements the largest tax benefit of a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained on audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position as of the reporting date. The term more likely than not means more than percent likely. (See Note 11. Income Tax Expense.)

 Minnesota Retail Rates. Minnesota Power s retail rates through 2021 were based on a 2018 MPUC retail rate order that allowed for a percent return on common equity and a percent equity ratio. The resolution of Minnesota Power s 2020 general rate case did not change the allowed return on equity or equity ratio. (See 2020 Minnesota General Rate Case .) 
 
 2020 Minnesota General Rate Case. In November 2019, Minnesota Power filed a retail rate increase request with the MPUC seeking an average increase of approximately percent for retail customers. In December 2019 orders, the MPUC accepted the filing as complete and authorized an annual interim rate increase of million beginning January 1, 2020. 
 
 In April 2020, Minnesota Power filed a request with the MPUC that proposed a resolution of Minnesota Power s 2020 general rate case. Key components of our proposal included removing the power marketing margin credit in base rates and reflecting actual power marketing margins in the fuel adjustment clause effective May 1, 2020; refunding to customers interim rates collected through April 2020; increasing customer rates percent compared to the percent increase reflected in interim rates; and a provision that Minnesota Power would not file another rate case until at least November 1, 2021, unless certain events occur. In a June 2020 order, the MPUC approved Minnesota Power s petition and proposal to resolve and withdraw the general rate case. Effective May 1, 2020, customer rates were set at an increase of percent with the removal of the power marketing margin credit from base rates. Actual power marketing margins are now reflected in the fuel adjustment clause. Reserves for interim rates of million were recorded in the second quarter of 2020 and refunded in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. 
 
 2022 Minnesota General Rate Case . On November 1, 2021, Minnesota Power filed a retail rate increase request with the MPUC seeking an average increase of approximately percent for retail customers. The rate filing seeks a return on equity of percent and a percent equity ratio. On an annualized basis, the requested final rate increase would generate approximately million in additional revenue. In orders dated December 30, 2021, the MPUC accepted the filing as complete and authorized an annual interim rate increase beginning January 1, 2022, with approximately million expected to be collected in cash and approximately million of interim rates for residential customers deferred with a final determination on recovery at the end of the rate case. 
 
 At a hearing on January 23, 2023, the MPUC made determinations regarding Minnesota Power s general rate case including allowing a return on common equity of percent and a percent equity ratio. Upon commencement of final rates, we expect additional revenue from base rates of approximately million and an additional million in revenue recognized under cost recovery riders on an annualized basis, subject to final written order and reconsideration. Final rates are expected to commence in the third quarter of 2023; interim rates will be collected through this period with reserves recorded as necessary. As a result of the MPUC s determinations made on January 23, 2023, Minnesota Power has recorded a reserve for an interim rate refund of approximately million pre-tax as of December 31, 2022, which is subject to MPUC approval of Minnesota Power s refund calculation. In addition, Minnesota Power recorded a charge of approximately million pre-tax to write-off the deferred portion of residential customer interim rates. Minnesota Power also recorded additional revenue of approximately million pre-tax for an increase in expected recoveries under its cost recovery riders. 
 
 FERC-Approved Wholesale Rates. Minnesota Power has wholesale contracts with non-affiliated municipal customers in Minnesota and SWL P. Two of the wholesale contracts include a termination clause requiring a -year notice to terminate. 
 
 Minnesota Power s wholesale electric contract with the Nashwauk Public Utilities Commission is effective through December 31, 2037. The wholesale electric service contract with SWL P is effective through February 28, 2026. Under the agreement with SWL P, no termination notice has been given. The rates included in these contracts are set each July 1 based on a cost-based formula methodology, using estimated costs and a rate of return that is equal to Minnesota Power s authorized rate of return for Minnesota retail customers. The formula-based rate methodology also provides for a yearly true-up calculation for actual costs incurred.

other municipal customers were extended in January 2022 and are effective through 2029. These contracts are based on fixed prices for capacity and energy. The base energy charge for each year is adjusted annually for updated fuel and purchased power costs. 
 
 Transmission Cost Recovery Rider . Minnesota Power has an approved cost recovery rider in place to charge retail customers on a current basis for certain transmission investments and expenditures, including a return on the capital invested. Current customer billing rates are based on an MPUC order dated December 27, 2022, which provisionally approved Minnesota Power s latest transmission factor filing submitted on October 31, 2022. 
 
 Renewable Cost Recovery Rider . Minnesota Power has an approved cost recovery rider in place to charge retail customers on a current basis for the costs of certain renewable investments and expenditures, including a return on the capital invested. Current customer billing rates for the renewable cost recovery rider were approved by the MPUC in a 2020 order. On February 2, 2022, Minnesota Power submitted its latest renewable factor filing, which included a request to recover a regulatory asset of million related to the recognition of production tax credits due to a metering error at Bison. The filing was approved in an order dated January 24, 2023 authorizing Minnesota Power to include updated billing rates on customer bills for recovery of the regulatory asset. 
 
 Solar Cost Recovery Rider . Minnesota Power has an approved cost recovery rider in place to charge retail customers on a current basis for solar costs related to investments and expenditures for meeting the state of Minnesota s solar energy standard. Current customer billing rates for the solar cost recovery rider were approved by the MPUC in an order dated August 31, 2022. 
 
 Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Petition . In April 2021, Minnesota Power filed a petition seeking approval to install and own DC fast charger stations for electric vehicles across its service territory, implement accompanying rates for those stations, and track and recover investments and expenses for the project. In an October 2021 order, the MPUC approved Minnesota Power s petition. 
 
 Fuel Adjustment Clause . In 2020, Minnesota Power filed its fuel adjustment forecast for 2021, which was approved by the MPUC in a December 2020 order, subject to the annual prudence review and true-up filing in 2022. During 2021, Minnesota Power incurred higher fuel and purchased power costs than those forecasted in its May 2020 filing, which resulted in the recognition of an approximately million regulatory asset through December 31, 2021. Minnesota Power submitted its annual true-up filing and a significant events filing in March 2022 requesting recovery of these under-collected fuel adjustment clause recoveries. The MPUC approved recovery of the regulatory asset in an order dated July 5, 2022; recovery of the regulatory asset will continue through mid-2023. 
 
 Minnesota Power also incurred higher fuel and purchased power costs in 2022 than those factored in its fuel adjustment forecast filed in May 2021 for 2022, which resulted in the recognition of an approximately million regulatory asset as of December 31, 2022. Minnesota Power filed a significant events filing in June 2022 requesting to increase rates from August 2022 through December 2022 in order to recover the under-collected fuel adjustment clause recoveries that were expected for 2022. No parties objected to the request and higher rates were implemented in August 2022. Minnesota Power will request recovery of the remaining regulatory asset as part of its annual true-up filing expected to be submitted to the MPUC in March 2023. 
 
 In 2020, Minnesota Power filed its FAC report covering the period July 2018 through December 2019. In a 2020 order, the MPUC referred the review of Minnesota Power s forced outage costs during the period of the report, which totaled approximately million, to an administrative law judge (ALJ) for a contested case hearing to recommend to the MPUC if any of those costs should be returned to customers. On August 11, 2021, the ALJ recommended that Minnesota Power refund approximately million to ratepayers. Minnesota Power submitted exceptions to the ALJ s report to the MPUC stating that it disagreed with the ALJ s recommendation and that no refund should be made as the Company operated its facilities in accordance with good utility practice. At a hearing on January 13, 2022, the MPUC agreed with the ALJ s recommendation and ordered the refund of approximately million to ratepayers, which was recorded as a reserve as of December 31, 2021, and refunded to customers in 2022. 
 
 Wisconsin Retail Rates. SWL P s retail rates through 2022 were based on a December 2018 order by the PSCW that allowed for a return on equity of percent and a percent equity ratio.

percent for retail customers. The filing sought an overall return on equity of percent and a percent equity ratio. On an annualized basis, the requested final rate increase would have generated an estimated million in additional revenue. In an order dated December 20, 2022, the PSCW approved an annual increase of million reflecting a return on equity of percent and percent equity ratio. Final rates went into effect January 1, 2023. 
 
 Integrated Resource Plan. On February 1, 2021, Minnesota Power filed its latest IRP, which was approved by the MPUC in an order dated January 9, 2023. The approved IRP, which reflects a joint agreement reached with various stakeholders, outlines Minnesota Power s clean-energy transition plans through 2035. These plans include expanding its renewable energy supply, achieving coal-free operations at its facilities by 2035, and investing in a resilient and flexible transmission and distribution grid. As part of these plans, Minnesota Power anticipates adding up to MW of new wind and solar energy resources, and ceasing coal operations at Boswell Units 3 and 4 by 2030 and 2035, respectively. Minnesota Power s plans recognize that advances in technology will play a significant role in completing its transition to carbon-free energy supply, reliably and affordably. Minnesota Power is expected to file its next IRP by March 1, 2025. 
 
 Conservation Improvement Program. Minnesota requires electric utilities to spend a minimum of percent of gross operating revenues, excluding revenue received from exempt customers, from service provided in the state on energy CIPs each year. 
 
 On April 1, 2022, Minnesota Power submitted its 2021 consolidated filing detailing Minnesota Power s CIP program results and proposed CIP financial incentive, which was approved by the MPUC in an order dated July 5, 2022. As a result, Minnesota Power recognized revenue of million in 2022 for the approved CIP financial incentive million in 2021 and million in 2020). CIP financial incentives are recognized in the period in which the MPUC approves the filing. 
 
 In 2020, Minnesota Power submitted its CIP triennial filing for 2021 through 2023 to the MPUC and Minnesota Department of Commerce, which outlines Minnesota Power s CIP spending and energy-saving goals for those years. Minnesota Power s CIP investment goal is million for 2023. 
 
 MISO Return on Equity Complaint. MISO transmission owners, including ALLETE and ATC, have an authorized return on equity of percent, or percent including an incentive adder for participation in a regional transmission organization based on a 2020 FERC order which is subject to various outstanding legal challenges related to the return on equity calculation and refund period ordered by the FERC. On August 9, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated and remanded the 2020 FERC order back to the FERC. We cannot predict the return on equity the FERC will ultimately authorize in the remanded proceeding. (See Note 6. Equity Investments.) 
 
 Minnesota Solar Energy Standard. Minnesota law requires at least percent of total retail electric sales, excluding sales to certain customers, to be generated by solar energy. At least percent of the percent mandate must be met by solar energy generated by or procured from solar photovoltaic devices with a nameplate capacity of 40 kW or less and community solar garden subscriptions. Minnesota Power has met both parts of the solar mandate to date. 
 
 In June 2020, Minnesota Power filed proposal with the MPUC to accelerate its plans for purchasing solar energy from approximately MW of solar energy projects in Minnesota which was approved in a June 2021 order. These solar energy projects will be constructed and owned through an ALLETE subsidiary with an estimated investment of million. Construction of these solar energy projects commenced in 2022 with a portion of these projects placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2022; the remaining project is expected to be placed into service in 2023. 
 
 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities. The recovery, refund or credit to rates for these regulatory assets and liabilities will occur over the periods either specified by the applicable regulatory authority or over the corresponding period related to the asset or liability.

 ATC s authorized return on equity is percent, or percent including an incentive adder for participation in a regional transmission organization, based on a 2020 FERC order which is subject to various outstanding legal challenges related to the return on equity calculation and refund period ordered by the FERC. On August 9, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated and remanded the 2020 FERC order back to FERC. As a result of this decision, ATC recorded a reserve in the third quarter of 2022 for anticipated refunds to its customers for approximately million of which our share was approximately million pre-tax. We cannot predict the return on equity FERC will ultimately authorize in the remanded proceeding. 
 
 In addition, the FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in April 2021 proposing to limit the basis point incentive adder for participation in a regional transmission organization to only the first three years of membership in such an organization. If this proposal is adopted, our equity in earnings from ATC would be reduced by approximately million pre-tax annually.

 The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 
 
 Level 1 Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. This category includes primarily equity securities. 
 
 Level 2 Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, but are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities or contracts, such as treasury securities with pricing interpolated from recent trades of similar securities, or priced with models using highly observable inputs, such as commodity options priced using observable forward prices and volatilities. This category includes deferred compensation and fixed income securities. 
 
 Level 3 Significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are those with inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation, such as the complex and subjective models and forecasts used to determine the fair value.

NOTE 9. COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) 

Air. The electric utility industry is regulated both at the federal and state level to address air emissions. Minnesota Power s thermal generating facilities mainly burn low-sulfur western sub-bituminous coal. All of Minnesota Power s coal-fired generating facilities are equipped with pollution control equipment such as scrubbers, baghouses and low NO X technologies. Under currently applicable environmental regulations, these facilities are substantially compliant with emission requirements. 
 
 Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). The CSAPR requires certain states in the eastern half of the U.S., including Minnesota, to reduce power plant emissions that contribute to ozone or fine particulate pollution in other states. The CSAPR does not require installation of controls but does require facilities have sufficient allowances to cover their emissions on an annual basis. These allowances are allocated to facilities from each state s annual budget, and can be bought and sold. Based on our review of the NO X and SO 2 allowances issued and pending issuance, we currently expect generation levels and emission rates will result in continued compliance with the CSAPR. The EPA s CSAPR Update Rule issued in March 2021 revising the 2016 CSAPR Update does not apply to the state of Minnesota and is therefore not currently projected to affect Minnesota Power s CSAPR compliance. Minnesota Power will continue to monitor ongoing CSAPR rulemakings and compliance implementation, including the EPA s Good Neighbor Rule proposed on April 6, 2022, to modify certain aspects of the CSAPR s program scope and extent. 
 
 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The EPA is required to review the NAAQS every five years. If the EPA determines that a state s air quality is not in compliance with the NAAQS, the state is required to adopt plans describing how it will reduce emissions to attain the NAAQS. Minnesota Power actively monitors NAAQS developments and compliance costs for existing standards or proposed NAAQS revisions are not currently expected to be material. The EPA is currently reviewing the secondary NAAQS for NO x and SO 2 , as well as particulate matter. In June 2021, the EPA announced it will reconsider the December 2020 final rule retaining the 2012 particulate matter NAAQS. On January 6, 2023 the EPA announced a proposed rule to revise the primary annual particulate matter NAAQS from its current level while retaining the other primary and secondary particulate matter NAAQS. A final rule is expected by the end of 2023. The EPA also announced in October 2021 that it was reconsidering the 2020 Ozone NAAQS rule finalized in December 2020, and issued a policy assessment on April 28, 2022, recommending retention of the current standard. A proposed Ozone NAAQS rule is expected in the first half of 2023. Anticipated compliance costs related to the proposed and expected NAAQS revisions cannot yet be estimated; however, costs could be material. Minnesota Power would seek recovery of additional costs through a rate proceeding.

years and be between approximately million and million. Compliance costs for CCR at Taconite Harbor are not expected to be material. Minnesota Power would seek recovery of additional costs through a rate proceeding. 
 
 Minnesota Power continues to work on minimizing costs through evaluation of beneficial re-use and recycling of CCR and CCR-related waters. In 2017, the EPA announced its intention to formally reconsider the CCR rule under Subtitle D of the RCRA. In March 2018, the EPA published the first phase of the proposed rule revisions in the Federal Register. In 2018, the EPA finalized revisions to elements of the CCR rule, including extending certain deadlines by two years, the establishment of alternative groundwater protection standards for certain constituents and the potential for risk-based management options at facilities based on site characteristics. In 2018, a U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia decision vacated specific provisions of the CCR rule. The court decision resulted in a change to the status of three existing clay-lined impoundments at Boswell that must now be considered unlined. The EPA proposed additional rule revisions in 2019 to address outstanding issues from litigation and closure timelines for unlined impoundments, respectively. The first of these rules, CCR Part A Rule, was finalized in September 2020. The Part A Rule revision requires unlined impoundments to cease disposal of waste as soon as technically feasible but no later than April 11, 2021. Minnesota Power sought EPA approval under the Part A Rule to extend the closure date for two active Boswell impoundments in November 2020. Upon completion of dry ash conversion activities, Boswell ceased disposal in both impoundments on September 17, 2022 and formally withdrew the CCR Part A Application. The EPA acknowledged the Part A variance application withdrawal on September 20, 2022, and indicated that no further EPA review of Boswell s Part A variance application will occur. Both impoundments are now inactive and have initiated closure. 
 
 Additionally, the EPA released a proposed Part B rulemaking in February 2020 addressing options for beneficial reuse of CCR materials, alternative liner demonstrations, and other CCR regulatory revisions. Portions of the Part B Rule addressing alternative liner equivalency standards were finalized in November 2020. According to the EPA s updated fall 2022 regulatory agenda, finalization of the remainder of the proposed Part B Rule is expected in late 2023. Two additional rulemakings are also expected in mid-2023, the proposed Legacy Impoundment Rule and the Final Federal Permit Rule. The Legacy Impoundment Rule will include a revised definition for legacy CCR Impoundments which could regulate impoundments that had closed prior to the effective date of the 2015 Rule. The Final Federal Permit Rule will finalize procedures for implementing a CCR Federal Permit Program. Expected compliance costs at Boswell due to the 2018 court decision and subsequent rule revisions are reflected in our estimate of compliance costs for the CCR rule noted previously.

 (a) 
 
 There were shares of ALLETE common stock included in pension plan equity securities as of December 31, 2022 shares as of December 31, 2021). 
 
 The defined benefit pension plans have adopted a dynamic asset allocation strategy (glide path) that increases the invested allocation to fixed income assets as the funding level of the plan increases to better match the sensitivity of the plan s assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. This is expected to reduce the volatility of reported pension plan expenses. The postretirement health and life plans assets are diversified to achieve strong returns within managed risk. Equity securities are diversified among domestic companies with large, mid and small market capitalizations, as well as investments in international companies. The majority of debt securities are made up of investment grade bonds.

 Eligible Executive Employees 
 ANNEX B 
 TO 
 ALLETE 
 EXECUTIVE LONG TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN 
 PERFORMANCE SHARE GRANT 
 
 Financial Measure 
 Fifty percent (50 of the total performance share opportunity is based on Total Shareholder Return (TSR) computed over the three-year performance period January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2025. 
 
 Fifty percent (50 of the total performance share opportunity is based on the Company s Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) computed over the three-year performance period January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2025. 

Performance Share Award (TSR metric) 
 Achievement will be weighted on TSR performance in accordance with ALLETE s TSR ranking as follows at the 85th percentile or higher among the peer group (superior performance), 200 of the weighted Performance Share Grant will be earned. If ALLETE s TSR ranking is at the 50 th percentile among the peer group (target performance), 100 of the weighted Performance Share Grant will be earned. If ALLETE s TSR ranking is at the 30 th percentile (threshold performance), 50 of the weighted Performance Share Grant will be earned. If TSR ranking is below threshold, no weighted Performance Shares will be earned. Straight-line interpolation will be used to determine earned awards based on the TSR ranking between threshold, target and superior. 
 Peer Group 
 The integrated utility companies comprising Edison Electric Institute (EEI) Stock Index as of December 31, 2025 that have been in the EEI Stock Index for at least three years as of December 31, 2025 will constitute the peer group used to determine actual payout results. The table below lists the EEI Stock Index as of December 31, 2022, based on published information available as of that date 
 7 

Alliant Energy Corporation Entergy Corporation Otter Tail Corporation Ameren Corporation Evergy Inc. PG&E Corporation American Electric Power Company Eversource Energy Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Avangrid, Inc. Exelon Corporation PNM Resources, Inc. Avista Corporation FirstEnergy Corporation Portland General Electric Company Black Hills Corporation Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. PPL Corporation CenterPoint Energy, Inc. IDACORP, Inc. Public Service Enterprise Group, Inc. CMS Energy Corporation MDU Resources Group, Inc. Sempra Energy Consolidated Edison, Inc. MGE Energy, Inc. The Southern Company Dominion Energy, Inc. NextEra Energy, Inc. Unitil Corporation DTE Energy Company NiSource, Inc. WEC Energy Group, Inc. Duke Energy Corporation NorthWestern Corporation Xcel Energy, Inc. Edison International OGE Energy Corp. 
 
 Any Company that is no longer included in the EEI Stock Index as of December 31, 2025 due to corporate restructuring during the performance period (e.g., mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, etc.) will be excluded from the results calculation entirely. If a corporate restructuring during the performance period results in a company remaining in the EEI Stock Index following the transaction (and thus not being excluded from the results calculation entirely), from the point of the transaction forward, the results calculation will track only the entity that remains in the EEI Stock Index and ignore other entities, regardless of whether such other entities are publicly traded. 
 
 Performance Share Award (CAGR metric) 
 
 CAGR will be calculated by using the baseline pro forma Earnings per Share (EPS) for the year ending December 31 of the year prior to the beginning of the three-year performance period and the pro forma EPS at the end of the three-year performance period. Achievement will be weighted on CAGR performance in accordance with the following table 
 
 Compound Annual Growth Rate Payout Percentage of Target Award) Superior 8 200 Target 6 100 Threshold 4 50 
 
 If CAGR percentage result is below threshold, no weighted Performance Shares will be earned. Straight-line interpolation will be used to determine earned awards based on the CAGR percentage result between threshold, target and superior.

Exhibit 99 For Release February 16, 2023 Investor Contact Vince Meyer 218-723-3952 NEWS vmeyer allete.com 
 
 ALLETE, Inc. reports 2022 earnings of 3.38 per share 
 Initiates 2023 earnings guidance range of 3.55 to 3.85 per share 
 
 DULUTH, Minn. - ALLETE, Inc. (NYSE ALE) today reported 2022 earnings of 3.38 per share on net income of 189.3 million and operating revenue of 1.6 billion. Reported results from 2021 were 3.23 per share on net income of 169.2 million and operating revenue of 1.4 billion. 
 
 I am proud of our many successes and accomplishments throughout 2022, all of which position ALLETE well now and into the future, said ALLETE Chair, President, and CEO Bethany Owen. The approval of Minnesota Power s Integrated Resource Plan results in a 600 million dollar expansion of our capital expenditure plan and will drive rate base growth to 11 percent over the next five years. Minnesota Power also achieved near-perfect system reliability for its customers during the year, and we know that additional transmission investments will be critical to help ensure reliability as the clean-energy transformation continues. To that end, the MISO Tranche 1 approval of the Northern Reliability Project transmission line, and advancing the ALLETE and Grid United vision for the nation s first transmission corridor to link three regional U.S. electric energy markets are important achievements in the year, which will drive significant future growth. With all of this, and the successful acquisition and integration of New Energy Equity expanding our presence in the growing solar sector ALLETE s strategic position is strong as the drive toward a clean-energy economy gains momentum. 
 
 In 2023, we will continue to advance these and other strategic initiatives that set the stage for meaningful future growth, Owen continued. ALLETE s Sustainability in Action strategy provides significant value to our customers, our communities, and our investors, as well as exciting opportunities for our employees. While our financial results for 2022 were below our expectations, ALLETE s future is very bright, with transformative clean-energy initiatives, significant infrastructure investments, and new opportunities with the distributed solar platform, pipeline, and strong team at New Energy. 
 
 Our financial performance in 2022 reflects Regulated Operations within our original guidance range, which included a full year of interim rate reserves recorded in the fourth quarter for the outcome of the Minnesota Power rate case, said ALLETE Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Steve Morris, ALLETE Clean Energy and Corporate and Other businesses were below expectations of our guidance range for the year, primarily due to losses taken on the now-completed Northern Wind project and financial underperformance of facilities in the Southwest Power Pool market, where we are working to navigate market and contract volatility related to our Oklahoma wind facilities. I remain confident in our growth prospects driven by our expanded capital expenditure plan over the next five years and investment opportunities well into the future. In addition, I am pleased with the momentum and future growth at New Energy as the team exceeded the acquisition plan for the year while completing integration, entering multiple new markets and significantly expanding their pipeline of projects. We believe our unique mix of businesses will continue to deliver a strong value proposition to shareholders for years to come.

ALLETE s Regulated Operations segment, which includes Minnesota Power, Superior Water, Light and Power and the Company s investment in the American Transmission Co., recorded net income of 149.9 million, compared to 129.1 million in 2021. Higher earnings in 2022 reflect the implementation of interim rates on January 1, 2022, net of interim rate reserves. This was partially offset by higher costs under a 250 MW power purchase agreement, higher operating and maintenance expense, and lower kilowatt-hour sales to industrial customers. ALLETE s earnings in ATC were lower than in 2021 primarily due to period-over-period changes in ATC s estimate of a refund liability related to MISO return on equity complaints. 
 
 ALLETE Clean Energy recorded 2022 net income of 16.3 million compared to 26.3 million in 2021. Net income in 2022 reflected challenges under the Caddo and Diamond Spring wind energy facilities power sales agreements resulting from market volatility and transmission congestion in the Southwest Power Pool. Net income in 2022 also included additional losses related to ALLETE Clean Energy s now completed and sold Northern Wind project. Net income in 2021 included the impact related to ALLETE Clean Energy s Diamond Spring wind energy facility due to an extreme winter storm event in February 2021. 
 
 Corporate and Other businesses, which include New Energy, BNI Energy, the Company s investment in the Nobles 2 wind energy facility, and ALLETE Properties, recorded net income of 23.1 million in 2022 compared to net income of 13.8 million in 2021. Net income in 2022 reflects net income from New Energy of 7.8 million, which was impacted by purchase price accounting. Net income in 2022 also reflects higher earnings from our investment in Nobles 2 due to higher wind resources in 2022, higher land sales at ALLETE Properties, and earnings from Minnesota solar projects placed into service in 2022. Partially offsetting these increases were transaction costs of 2.7 million after-tax related to the acquisition of New Energy, and higher other expenses compared to 2021. Net income in 2021 included South Shore Energy s sale of a portion of its interest in NTEC to Basin Electric Cooperative which resulted in the recognition of an approximately 8.5 million after-tax gain. 
 
 Details of the Company s 2023 earnings guidance were filed as part of today s Form 8-K filing.

These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and investors are directed to the risks discussed in documents filed by ALLETE with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 
 ALLETE's press releases and other communications may include certain non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) financial measures.

Non-GAAP financial measures utilized by the Company include presentations of earnings (loss) per share. ALLETE's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors by removing the effect of variances in GAAP reported results of operations that are not indicative of changes in the fundamental earnings power of the Company's operations. Management believes that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures is appropriate and enables investors and analysts to more accurately compare the company's ongoing financial performance over the periods presented.
