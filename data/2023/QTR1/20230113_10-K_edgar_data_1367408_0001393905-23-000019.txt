 PART I 
 
 Item 1. Description of Business 
 
 Sino American Oil Company (the Company is a development stage enterprise that was originally incorporated on April 2, 2010, under the laws of the State of Nevada. The Company is in the Oil and Gas Exploration, Development and Production Business and has been since inception. On November 11, 2018, the Company filed a re-domestication to have its domestic corporation be administered under the laws of the State of Wyoming. 
 
 Sino American Oil Company plans to grow shareholder value through securing oil and natural gas reserves and negotiating oil and natural gas exploration, development and production deals within the United States of America and Canada. The focused industries are oil gas exploration, oil gas development, and oil gas production sales. We anticipate being able to generate revenue on the sale of oil and gas. 
 
 Sino American Oil Company is currently negotiating deals within a very large exploration area oil field owners located in the Western Canadian sedimentary basin. The deals involve oil and gas production acquisitions, mineral land acquisitions and further production increases through production optimization and drilling activities as well as production infrastructure installations. 
 
 On January 16, 2020, the Company received a Cease Trade Order from the British Columbia Securities Commission for failure to file records required as an OTC reporting issuer. We are working to remedy this Order.

 Our Business Objectives 
 
 Our principal business objective is to maximize shareholders returns through a combination of (1) sustainable long-term growth in cash flows from distribution of the products described herein, (2) potential long-term appreciation in the value of our properties from capital gains upon potential future sales, (3) other sustainable oil and gas business opportunities which the Board of Directors determines to be beneficial to Company. 
 1 

Business Overview 
 
 Sino American Oil Company believes that Oil and Gas industry is a well understood and vital industry that all Americans agree is vital to the national and world economy. Exploring for inexpensive, economical, and now highlighting, environmentally responsible extraction with limited damage to the land, are actions that the company is committed to perform. 
 
 Oil exploration, oil production, oil drilling, oil extraction, and oil Refining operations exist throughout the United States of America and the world. The terms Hydrocarbon Industry and the Oil and Gas industry are often used interchangeably with Energy Commodities . 
 
 The Oil and Gas Industry 
 
 The oil and gas industry are two of the largest sectors in the world economy in terms of dollar value, generating an estimated trillions of dollars of revenue annually.1 Oil is crucial to the global economic framework, especially for its largest producers: The United States of America, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Canada, and China. 
 
 About Hydrocarbons 
 
 Crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are made up of Hydrocarbons which are naturally occurring substances found in rock in the earth s crust. These organic raw materials are created by the compression of the remains of plants and animals in sedimentary rocks such as sandstone, limestone and shale. 
 
 The sedimentary rock itself is a product of deposits in ancient oceans and other bodies of water. As layers of sediment were deposited on the ocean floor, the decaying remains of plants and animals were integrated into the forming rock. The organic material eventually transforms into Hydrocarbons after being exposed to specific temperatures and pressure ranges deep within the earth s crust. 
 
 Oil and gas are less dense than water, therefore they migrate through porous sedimentary rock toward the earth s surface. When the Hydrocarbons are trapped beneath less-porous cap rock, an oil and gas reservoir is formed. These reservoirs of oil and gas represent our sources of crude oil and gas. 
 
 Hydrocarbons are brought to the surface by drilling through the cap rock and into the reservoir.5 Once the drill bit reaches the reservoir, a productive oil or gas well can be completed and the Hydrocarbons can be produced at the surface.6 When the drilling activity does not find commercially economic quantities of Hydrocarbons, the well is classified as a dry hole, which dry hole is typically plugged and abandoned. 
 
 Upstream, Midstream, Downstream 
 
 The oil and gas industry are broken down into three main segments: upstream, midstream and downstream. 
 
 Upstream 
 
 Upstream businesses consist of companies involved in the exploration, development and production of oil and gas. These Upstream companies are often referred to as E P Companies for exploration and production. 
 
 The upstream segment is characterized by higher risks, high investment capital, extended duration as it takes time to locate and drill, as well as being technologically intensive. Virtually all cash flow and income statement line items of E P companies are directly related to oil and gas production. 
 
 Midstream 
 
 Midstream businesses are those that are focused on transportation. They are the ones responsible for moving the extracted raw materials to refineries to process the oil and gas. Midstream companies are characterized by shipping, trucking, pipelines, and storing of the raw materials. The midstream segment is also marked by high regulation, particularly on pipeline transmission, and low capital risk. The segment is also naturally dependent on the success of upstream firms. 
 2 

Downstream 
 
 Downstream businesses are the refineries. These are the companies responsible for removing impurities and converting the oil and gas to products for the general public, such as gasoline, jet fuel, heating oil, and asphalt etc.

 Market Competition and Partnership Opportunities 
 
 Sino American Oil Company is an American company and seeks acquisition of oil and/or natural gas properties to develop and produce. Develop and Produce means to explore, discover areas for extraction, and the logistics that involve taking the oil and/or gas from under the ground to the proper refineries. It may also involve seeking partnership opportunities because oil projects can come in small, medium, large, and international sizes and multi-corporation efforts may be required for expensive and complex drilling activities. 
 
 The Company s /Operator Liability 
 
 Liability is a significant concern for oil and gas exploration and development companies. Increased regulations are in place to ensure that the Operators are environmentally responsible and financially sound to handle their obligations to population. Sino American Oil Company will have in place the maximum amount of Operator liability, environmental, surface and underground blow out insurance. Operator Liability involves municipal Occupational Safety and Hazard regulations (OSHA), and using safety equipment and a plan for safety for all workers. The Company has consultants that have Confined Space and Advanced Rescue, oxygen monitoring experts, and power (electricity) designers that can aid in the configuration of egress and ingress safety of mines, wells, and craters and seams. 
 
 The Life Cycle of a Well: 
 
 Every company that explores for and develops oil and natural gas resources is financially responsible for safely managing each well it drills, as well as any associated facilities. This is law in all of Canada and United States. 
 
 This includes all stages of a well s life cycle: exploration, development, and operation, as well as end-of-life activities including abandonment and reclamation. When an oil or natural gas well is no longer productive, the operating company is required by regulations to remove equipment and reclaim the site. Regulatory requirements are documented under various government acts. 
 
 Definitions and well Classifications: 
 
 Active - a well that is currently producing oil or natural gas. 
 
 Inactive - a well or associated facility where activities have stopped due to technical or economic reasons. Not all sites in this category are orphaned. Many may be brought into production again at a later date. 
 
 Suspended - a well that is not currently producing, has been safely secured, but may produce in the future. 
 3 
 
 Abandoned - a site that is permanently dismantled (plugged, cut and capped) and left in a safe and secure condition, in accordance with all applicable governing regulations. 
 
 Remediation - the process of cleaning up a contaminated well site to meet specific soil and groundwater standards. 
 
 Reclamation Certified (Rec Cert) - well sites that are remediated and reclaimed to the regulatory standard of the day. 
 
 Orphan - a well or facility confirmed not to have anyone responsible or able to deal with its abandonment and reclamation. 
 
 Covering the Costs of Orphan Wells: 
 
 Abandoned, inactive and suspended wells have an identifiable owner, the licensee, and are financially managed by the licensee through to end-of-life activities. To protect against licensees whose businesses failed and are unable to cover the costs for abandonment and reclamation every industry Operator pays into the Orphan Well Fund so that there will be funds available for the applicable governmental authority to properly abandon and reclaim an orphan well. 
 
 Other Considerations 
 
 Oil and Gas enterprises may involve a variety of other legal issues, depending largely on the activities involved and the laws of the state/province of where the exploration, development and production occurs. This Company plans to obtain abide by all appropriate applicable public health and safety laws of the said state/province. 
 
 Other Considerations 
 
 Oil and Gas enterprises (meaning conglomerates and companies that do a specific type of oil production and/or refinement) may involve a variety of other legal issues, depending largely on the activities involved and the laws of the state of where the extraction occurs. This Company plans to obtain all appropriate public health and safety laws of the said state.

 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Sino American Oil Company (the Company as of September 30, 2022, the related statement of operations, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
 
 Substantial Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 
 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company s significant operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or are required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. 
 
 We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

At the time of such issuances, the Company s common stock did not trade in an active market. Accordingly, the determination of fair value of the Company s common stock was determined by a third-party specialist. 
 
 The valuation of common stock off a non-trading company requires significant judgment in weighting the various indicators of fair value. In this case, the specialist determined a cost approach was appropriate and significant assumptions utilized in the valuation included total invested equity capital, outstanding debt, and applicability of a discount for lack of marketability. 
 
 We determined that auditing the fair value of common stock issued for services was a critical audit matter as auditing the appropriateness of the valuation model and significant assumptions required significant auditor judgment and specialized skill and knowledge. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, but were not limited to, the following: 
 
 We evaluated management s and the third-party specialist s process for the selection of the valuation methodology and the methods and significant assumptions used by management; 
 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation methodology used; 
 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of the inputs subject to assumptions and verified the accuracy and completeness of those inputs to the underlying transaction data utilized in the valuation of the common stock and verified; and 
 F-2 
 
 We assessed the knowledge and ability of the Company s specialist, including their independence to the Company. 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 As described further in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred losses from inception through September 30, 2021 and expects to incur additional losses in the future. 
 
 We determined the Company s ability to continue as a going concern is a critical audit matter due to the estimation and uncertainty regarding the Company s future cash flows and the risk of bias in management s judgments and assumptions in estimating these cash flows. 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the Company s assertion on its ability to continue as a going concern included the following, among others: 
 
 We reviewed the Company s working capital and liquidity ratios and forecasted revenue, operating expenses, and uses and sources of cash used in management s assessment of whether the Company has sufficient liquidity to fund operations for at least one year from the financial statement issuance date. This testing included inquiries with management, comparison of prior period forecasts to actual results, consideration of positive and negative evidence impacting management s forecasts, the Company s financing arrangements in place as of the report date, market and industry factors and consideration of the Company s relationships with its financing partners. 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note #3 to the financial statements, although the Company has limited operations it has yet to attain profitability. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plan in regard to these matters is also described in Note #3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the 
 
 financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management is responsible to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our Chief Executive Officer is responsible to design or supervise a process that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The policies and procedures include: 
 
 maintenance of records in reasonable detail to accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets, 
 
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors, and 
 
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 
 8 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period September 30, 2021. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the fiscal year September 30, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting were not effective at that reasonable assurance level. The following aspects of the Company were noted as potential material weaknesses: 
 
 Due to our size and limited resources, we currently do not employ the appropriate accounting personnel to ensure (a) we maintain proper segregation of duties, (b) that all transactions are entered timely and accurately, and (c) we properly account for complex or unusual transactions; 
 
 Due to our size and scope of operations, we currently do not have an independent audit committee in place; 
 
 Due to our size and limited resources, we have not properly documented a complete assessment of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

 Conflicts of Interest 
 
 Investors should be aware of the following potential conflicts of interest: 
 
 None of our officers and directors is required to commit their full time to our affairs and, accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time among various business activities. 
 
 Director Independence 
 
 We currently do not have any independent directors, as the term independent is defined in Section 803A of the NYSE Amex LLC Company Guide. Since the OTC Markets does not have rules regarding director independence, the Board makes its determination as to director independence based on the definition of independence as defined under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange NYSE and American Stock Exchange Amex ). 
 
 Board Committees 
 
 Our board does not currently have a standing Audit Committee, Compensation Committee or Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee due the board s limited size and the Company s limited operations. The entire Board of Directors performs all functions that would otherwise be performed by committees. Given the present size of our Board, it is not practical for us to have committees other than those described above, or to have more than two directors on such committees. If we are able to grow our business and increase our operations, we intend to expand the size of our board and our committees and allocate responsibilities accordingly. 
 
 Code of Ethics
