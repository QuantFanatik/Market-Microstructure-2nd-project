 PART I 
 ITEM 1.	BUSINESS. 
 General Overview 
 McGrath RentCorp (the Company is a California corporation organized in 1979 with corporate offices located in Livermore, California. The Company s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol MGRC . References in this report to the Company , we , us , and ours refer to McGrath RentCorp and its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise. 
 The Company is a diversified business-to-business rental company with four rental divisions: relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. Although the Company s primary emphasis is on equipment rentals, sales of equipment occur in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2022, the Company was comprised of four reportable business segments: (1) its modular building and portable storage segment Mobile Modular ); (2) its electronic test equipment segment TRS-RenTelco ); (3) its containment solutions for the storage of hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids segment Adler Tanks ); and (4) its classroom manufacturing business selling modular buildings used primarily as classrooms in California Enviroplex ). 
 On February 1, 2023, the Company sold the Adler Tanks business to Ironclad Environmental Solutions, Inc., a Kinderhook portfolio company, for a cash sale price of 265 million, subject to certain adjustments. On the same date, the Company acquired Vesta Housing Solutions Holdings, Inc. Vesta Modular ), a portfolio company of Kinderhook Industries, that is a leading provider of temporary and permanent modular space solutions, for a cash purchase price of 400 million, subject to certain adjustments. 
 Business Model 
 The Company invests capital in rental products and generally has recovered its original investment through rents less cash operating expenses in a relatively short period of time compared to the product s rental life. When the Company s rental products are sold, the proceeds generally have covered a high percentage of the original investment. With these characteristics, a significant base of 
 - 2 - 
 
 rental assets on rent generates a considerable amount of operating cash flows to support continued rental asset growth. The Company s rental products have the following characteristics: 
 The product required by the customer tends to be expensive compared to the Company s monthly rental charge, with the interim rental solution typically evaluated as a less costly alternative. 

Generally, we believe the Company s customers have a short-term need for our rental products. The customer s rental requirement may be driven by a number of factors including time, budget or capital constraints, future uncertainty impacting their ongoing requirements, equipment availability, specific project requirements, peak periods of demand or the customer may want to eliminate the burdens and risks of ownership. 

All of the Company s rental products have long useful lives relative to the typical rental term. Modular buildings modulars have an estimated life of eighteen years compared to the typical rental term of twelve to twenty-four months, electronic test equipment has an estimated life range of one to eight years (depending on the type of product) compared to a typical rental term of one to six months, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes have an estimated life of twenty years compared to typical rental terms of one to six months. 

We believe short-term rental rates typically recover the Company s original investment quickly based on the respective product s annual yield, or annual rental revenues divided by the average cost of rental equipment. For modulars the original investment is recovered in approximately four years, in approximately three years for electronic test equipment and in approximately five years for liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. 

When a product is sold from our rental inventory, a significant portion of the original investment is usually recovered. Effective asset management is a critical element to each of the rental businesses and the residuals realized when product is sold from inventory. Modular asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life, coupled with ongoing repair and maintenance investments, to ensure its long useful rental life and generally higher residuals upon sale. Electronic test equipment asset management requires understanding, selecting and investing in equipment technologies that support market demand and, once invested, proactively managing the equipment at the model level for optimum utilization through its technology life cycle to maximize the rental revenues and residuals realized. Liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes asset management requires selecting and purchasing quality product and making ongoing repair and maintenance investments to ensure its long rental life. 

The Company believes that rental revenue growth from an increasing base of rental assets and improved gross profits on rents are the best measures of the health of each of our rental businesses. Additionally, we believe our business model and results are enhanced by operational leverage that is created from large regional sales and inventory centers for modulars, a single U.S. based sales, inventory and operations facility for electronic test equipment, as well as shared senior management and back-office functions for financing, human resources, insurance, marketing, information technology and operating and accounting systems. 
 Human Capital Management 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 1,218 employees, of whom 133 were primarily administrative and executive personnel, with 705, 166, 134 and 80 in the operations of Mobile Modular, Adler Tanks, TRS-RenTelco and Enviroplex, respectively. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and management believes its relationship with our employees is good. 
 The Company believes its employees are key to its success and it is committed to all of its employees engagement, training and career development, and personal and professional growth. The Board of Directors also receives regular updates from senior management on matters relating to the Company s strategy for the recruitment, retention and development of the Company s employees. The Company provides training in technical, operational and managerial skills, and places special emphasis on safety, effective communications, customer service, and employee development. Additionally, the Company offers employees a tuition reimbursement program whereby the employee may receive reimbursement for tuition and fees for undergraduate or graduate level academic courses at an accredited two or four year college or university that may help employees improve performance in their current job or prepare them for advancement. 
 Government Regulations 
 We are subject to certain environmental, transportation, anti-corruption, import controls, health and safety, privacy and other laws and regulations in locations in which we operate. Our activity in jurisdictions in which we operate is additionally subject to anti-bribery laws and regulations, such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, which prevent companies and their officers, employees and agents from making payments to officials and public entities of foreign countries to facilitate obtaining new contracts. We are also subject to laws and regulations that govern and impose liability for activities that may have adverse environmental effects, including discharges into air and water, and handling and disposal of hazardous substances and waste. Our motor vehicles and related units are subject to regulation in certain states under motor vehicle and similar registrations. While we incur costs in our business to comply with 
 - 3 - 
 
 these laws and regulations, management does not believe that the costs of compliance with these various governmental regulations is material to our business and financial condition.

These filings include our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Act of 1934, which are available as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes such material to, the SEC.

 RELOCATABLE MODULAR BUILDINGS 
 Description 
 Modulars are designed for use as classrooms, temporary offices adjacent to existing facilities, sales offices, construction field offices, restroom buildings, health care clinics, child care facilities, office space and for a variety of other purposes and may be moved from one location to another. Modulars vary from simple single-unit construction site offices to multi-floor modular complexes. The Company s modular rental fleet includes a full range of styles and sizes. The Company considers its modulars to be among the most attractive and well-designed available. The units are constructed with wood or metal siding, sturdily built and physically capable of a long useful life. Modulars are generally provided with installed heat, air conditioning, lighting, electrical outlets and floor covering, and may have customized interiors including partitioning, cabinetry and plumbing facilities. 
 Mobile Modular purchases new modulars from various manufacturers who build to Mobile Modular s design specifications. During 2022, Mobile Modular purchased 30 of its modular units from one manufacturer. The Company believes that the loss of any of its primary modular manufacturers could have an adverse effect on its operations since Mobile Modular could experience higher prices and longer lead times for delivery of modular units until other manufacturers were able to increase their production capacity. 
 The Company s modulars are manufactured to comply with state building codes, have a low risk of obsolescence, and can be modified or reconfigured to accommodate a wide variety of customer needs. Historically, as state building codes have changed over the years, Mobile Modular has been able to continue to use existing modulars, with minimal, if any, required upgrades. The Company has no assurance that it will continue to be able to use existing modular equipment with minimal upgrades as building codes change in the future. 
 Mobile Modular currently operates from regional sales and inventory centers in California, Texas, Florida, Georgia and Virginia, serving large geographic areas in these and surrounding states, and sales offices serving Louisiana, North Carolina and South Carolina. In 2021, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of Design Space Modular Buildings PNW, LP, which operated from a number of smaller sales and inventory centers across the Western United States. In 2021, the Company completed the purchase of the assets of GRS Holding LLC, DBA Kitchens To Go Kitchens To Go ). Kitchens To Go provides interim and permanent modular kitchen solutions serving the United States from its inventory center in Indiana. These sales and inventory centers have in-house infrastructure and operational capabilities to support quick and efficient repair, modification, and refurbishment of equipment for the next rental opportunity. The Company believes operating from large regional sales and inventory centers results in better operating margins as operating costs can be spread over a large installed customer base. Mobile Modular actively maintains and repairs its rental equipment, and management believes this ensures the continued use of the modular product over its long life and, when sold, has resulted in higher sale proceeds relative to its capitalized cost. When rental equipment returns from a customer, the necessary repairs and preventative maintenance are performed prior to its next rental. By making these expenditures for repair and maintenance throughout the equipment s life we believe that older equipment can generally rent for rates similar to those of newer equipment. Management believes the condition of the equipment is a more significant factor in determining the rental rate and sale price than its age. Over the last three years, used equipment sold each year represented approximately 2 of rental equipment, and has been, on average, 14 years old with sale proceeds above its net book value. 
 On February 1, 2023, the Company acquired Vesta Modular, a portfolio company of Kinderhook Industries, that is a leading provider of temporary and permanent modular space solutions, for a cash purchase price of 400 million, subject to certain adjustments. The acquisition creates a larger scaled modular business with increased geographic coverage and density to serve customers. 
 Competitive Strengths 
 Market Leadership Mobile Modular has the leading modular building and container fleet in the United States. Rental units for temporary classroom and other educational space needs are an important market segment and the Company believes Mobile Modular is the leading supplier in California and Florida, and a significant supplier in Texas, of modular educational facilities for rental to both public and private schools. Management is knowledgeable about the needs of its educational customers and the related regulatory requirements in the states where Mobile Modular operates, which enables Mobile Modular to meet its customers specific project requirements. 
 Expertise The Company believes that over the 40 plus years during which Mobile Modular has competed in the modular rental industry, it has developed expertise that differentiates it from its competitors. Mobile Modular has dedicated its attention to continuously developing and improving the quality of its modular units. Mobile Modular has expertise in the licensing and regulatory requirements that govern modulars in the states where it operates, and its management, sales and operational staffs are knowledgeable and committed to providing exemplary customer service. Mobile Modular has expertise in project management and complex applications.

 Operating Structure Part of the Company s strategy for Mobile Modular is to create facilities and infrastructure capabilities that its competitors cannot easily duplicate. Mobile Modular achieves this by building regional sales and inventory centers designed to serve a broad geographic area and a large installed customer base under a single overhead structure, thereby reducing its cost per transaction. The Company s regional facilities and related infrastructure enable Mobile Modular to maximize its modular inventory utilization through efficient and cost effective in-house repair, maintenance and refurbishment for quick redeployment of equipment to meet its customers needs. 
 Asset Management The Company believes Mobile Modular markets high quality, well-constructed and attractive modulars. Mobile Modular requires manufacturers to build to its specifications, which enables Mobile Modular to maintain a standardized quality fleet. In addition, through its ongoing repair, refurbishment and maintenance programs, the Company believes Mobile Modular s buildings are the best maintained in the industry. The Company depreciates its modular buildings over an 18 year estimated useful life to a 50 residual value. Older buildings continue to be productive primarily because of Mobile Modular s focus on ongoing fleet maintenance. Also, as a result of Mobile Modular s maintenance programs, when a modular unit is sold, a high percentage of the equipment s capitalized cost is recovered. In addition, the fleet s utilization is regionally optimized by managing inventory through estimates of market demand, fulfillment of current rental and sale order activity, modular returns and capital purchases. 
 Customer Service - The Company believes the modular rental industry to be service intensive and locally based. The Company strives to provide excellent service by meeting its commitments to its customers, being proactive in resolving project issues and seeking to continuously improve the customers experience. Mobile Modular is committed to offering quick response to requests for information, providing experienced assistance, on time delivery and preventative maintenance of its units. Mobile Modular s goal is to continuously improve its procedures, processes and computer systems to enhance internal operational efficiency. The Company believes this dedication to customer service results in high levels of customer loyalty and repeat business. 
 Market 
 Management estimates relocatable modular building rental is an industry that today has equipment on rent or available for rent in the U.S. with an aggregate original cost of over 5.0 billion. Mobile Modular s largest market segment is for temporary classroom and other educational space needs of public and private schools, colleges and universities in California and Florida, and to a lesser extent in Texas, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Management believes the demand for rental classrooms is caused by shifting and fluctuating school populations, the limited state funds for new construction, the need for temporary classroom space during reconstruction of older schools, class size reduction and the phasing out of portable classrooms compliant with older building codes (see Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12) below). Other customer applications include sales offices, construction field offices, health care facilities, church sanctuaries and child care facilities. Industrial, manufacturing, entertainment and utility companies, as well as governmental agencies commonly use large multi-modular complexes to serve their interim administrative and operational space needs. Modulars offer customers quick, cost-effective space solutions while conserving their capital. The Company s corporate offices and regional sales and inventory center offices are housed in various sizes of modular units. 
 Since most of Mobile Modular s customer requirements are to fill temporary space needs, Mobile Modular s marketing emphasis is on rentals rather than sales. Mobile Modular attracts customers through its website at www.mobilemodular.com, internet advertising and direct marketing. Customers are encouraged to visit a regional sales and inventory center to view different models on display and to see a regional office, which is a working example of a modular application. 
 Because service is a major competitive factor in the rental of modulars, Mobile Modular offers quick response to requests for information, assistance in the choice of a suitable size and floor plan, in-house customization services, rapid delivery, timely installation and field service of its units. On Mobile Modular s website, customers are able to view and select inventory for quotation and request in-field service. 
 Rentals 
 Rental periods range from one month to several years with a typical initial contract term between twelve and twenty-four months. In general, monthly rental rates are determined by a number of factors including length of term, market demand, product availability and product type. Upon expiration of the initial term, or any extensions, rental rates are reviewed, and when appropriate, are adjusted based on current market conditions. Most rental agreements are operating leases that provide no purchase options, and when a rental agreement does provide the customer with a purchase option, it is generally on terms management believes to be attractive to Mobile Modular. 
 The customer is responsible for obtaining the necessary use permits and for the costs of insuring the unit, and is financially responsible for transporting the unit to the site, preparation of the site, installation of the unit, dismantle and return delivery of the unit to Mobile Modular, and certain costs for customization. Mobile Modular maintains the units in good working condition while on rent. Upon return, the units are inspected for damage and customers are billed for items considered beyond normal wear and tear. Generally, 
 - 6 - 
 
 the units are then repaired for subsequent use. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and can include floor repairs, roof maintenance, cleaning, painting and other cosmetic repairs. The costs of major refurbishment of equipment are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly improves the quality and adds value or life to the equipment. 
 At December 31, 2022, Mobile Modular owned 70,233 new or previously rented modulars and portable storage containers with an aggregate cost of 1,123.3 million including accessories, or an average cost per unit of 15,993. Utilization is calculated at the end of each month by dividing the cost of rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding new equipment inventory and accessory equipment. At December 31, 2022, fleet utilization was 80.7 and average fleet utilization during 2022 was 79.1 . The Mobile Modular segment includes the results of operations of Mobile Modular Portable Storage and Kitchens To Go, which represented approximately 11 and 2 of the Company s 2022 total revenues, respectively. 
 Sales 
 In addition to operating its rental fleet, Mobile Modular sells modulars to customers. These sales may arise out of its marketing efforts for the rental fleet and from existing equipment already on rent or from specific requests for new buildings for a permanent need. The Company has a dedicated team that focuses on these custom sale opportunities. Such sales can be of either new or used units from the rental fleet, which permits some turnover of older units. During 2022 Mobile Modular s largest sale represented approximately 4 of Mobile Modular s sales, 3 of the Company s consolidated sales and less than 1 of the Company s consolidated revenues. 
 Mobile Modular typically provides limited 90-day warranties on used modulars and passes through the manufacturers one-year warranty on new units to its customers. Warranty costs have not been significant to Mobile Modular s operations to date, and the Company attributes this to its commitment to high quality standards and regular maintenance programs. However, there can be no assurance that warranty costs will continue to be insignificant to Mobile Modular s operations in the future. 
 Enviroplex manufactures portable classrooms built to the requirements of the California Division of the State Architect DSA and sells directly to California public school districts and other educational institutions. 
 Seasonality 
 Typically, during each calendar year, our highest numbers of classrooms are shipped for rental and sale orders during the second and third quarters for delivery and installation prior to the start of the upcoming school year. The majority of classrooms shipped in the second and third quarters have rental start dates during the third quarter, thereby making the fourth quarter the first full quarter of rental revenues recognized for these transactions. 
 Competition 
 Competition in the rental and sale of relocatable modular buildings is intense. Some of our competitors in the modular building leasing industry, notably WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Corp, have a greater range of products and services, greater financial and marketing resources, larger customer bases, and greater name recognition than we have. In addition, a number of other smaller companies operate regionally throughout the country. Mobile Modular operates primarily in California, the Pacific Northwest, Texas, Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, Maryland and Washington, D.C. Significant competitive factors in the rental business include availability, price, service, reliability, appearance and functionality of the product. Mobile Modular markets high quality, well-constructed and attractive modulars. Part of the Company s strategy for modulars is to create facilities and infrastructure capabilities that its competitors cannot easily duplicate. The Company's facilities and related infrastructure enable it to modify modulars efficiently and cost effectively to meet its customers needs. Management's goal is to be more responsive at less expense. Management believes this strategy, together with its emphasis on prompt and efficient customer service, gives Mobile Modular a competitive advantage. Mobile Modular is determined to respond quickly to requests for information, and provide experienced assistance for the first-time user, rapid delivery and timely repair of its modular units. Mobile Modular s already high level of efficiency and responsiveness continues to improve as the Company upgrades procedures, processes and computer systems that control its internal operations. The Company anticipates intense competition to continue and believes it must continue to improve its products and services to remain competitive in the market for modulars. 
 Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12) 
 Mobile Modular and Enviroplex provide classroom and specialty space needs serving public and private schools, colleges and universities. Within the educational market, the rental (by Mobile Modular) and sale (by Enviroplex and Mobile Modular) of modulars to public school districts for use as portable classrooms, restroom buildings and administrative offices for kindergarten through grade twelve (K-12) are a significant portion of the Company s revenues. Mobile Modular rents and sells classrooms in California, the Pacific Northwest, Florida, Texas, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Enviroplex sells classrooms in the California market. California is Mobile Modular s largest educational market. Historically, demand in this market has been fueled by shifting and fluctuating student populations, insufficient funding for new school construction, class size reduction

 programs, modernization of aging school facilities and the phasing out of portable classrooms no longer compliant with current building codes. The following table shows the approximate percentages of the Company s modular rental and sales revenues, and of its consolidated rental and sales revenues for the past five years, that rentals and sales to these schools constitute:

School Facility Funding 
 Funding for public school facilities is derived from a variety of sources including the passage of both statewide and local facility bond measures, operating budgets, developer fees, various taxes including parcel and sales taxes levied to support school operating budgets, and lottery funds. There is no certainty on the timing of the bond sales and it could take additional years before projects funded by these bonds generate meaningful demand for relocatable classrooms.

 ELECTRONIC TEST EQUIPMENT 
 Description 
 TRS-RenTelco rents and sells electronic test equipment nationally and internationally from two facilities located on the grounds of the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport in Grapevine, Texas (the Dallas facility and Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Canada (the Montreal facility ). TRS-RenTelco s revenues are derived from the rental and sale of general purpose and communications test equipment to a broad range of companies, from Fortune 500 to middle and smaller market companies, in the aerospace, defense, communications, manufacturing and semiconductor industries. Electronic test equipment revenues are primarily affected by the business activity within these industries related to research and development, manufacturing, and communication infrastructure installation and maintenance. The Dallas facility, TRS-RenTelco s primary operating location, houses the electronic test equipment inventory, sales engineers, calibration laboratories, and operations staff for U.S. and international business. The Montreal facility houses sales engineers and operations staff to serve the Canadian market. As of December 31, 2022, the original cost of electronic test equipment inventory was comprised of 80 general purpose electronic test equipment and 20 communications electronic test equipment. 
 Engineers, technicians and scientists utilize general purpose electronic test equipment in developing products, controlling manufacturing processes, completing field service applications and evaluating the performance of their own electrical and electronic equipment. These instruments are rented primarily to aerospace, defense, electronics, industrial, research and semiconductor industries. To date, Keysight Technologies, Rhode Schwarz and Tektronix, a division of Fortive Corporation, have manufactured the majority of TRS-RenTelco s general purpose electronic test equipment with the remainder acquired from over 60 other manufacturers. 
 Communications test equipment, including fiber optic test equipment, is utilized by technicians, engineers and installation contractors to evaluate voice, data and multimedia communications networks, to install fiber optic cabling, and in the development and manufacturing of transmission, network and wireless products. These instruments are rented primarily to manufacturers of communications equipment and products, electrical and communications installation contractors, field technicians, and service providers. To date, Anritsu, Viavi Solutions and Fluke Networks, a division of Fortive Corporation, have manufactured a significant portion of TRS-RenTelco s communications test equipment, with the remainder acquired from over 40 other manufacturers. 
 TRS-RenTelco s general purpose test equipment rental inventory includes oscilloscopes, amplifiers, analyzers (spectrum, network and logic), signal source and power source test equipment. The communications test equipment rental inventory includes network and transmission test equipment for various fiber, copper and wireless networks. TRS-RenTelco occasionally rents electronic test equipment from other rental companies and re-rents the equipment to customers. 
 Competitive Strengths 
 Market Leadership - The Company believes that TRS-RenTelco is one of the largest electronic test equipment rental and leasing companies offering a broad and deep selection of general purpose and communications test equipment for rent in North America. 
 Expertise - The Company believes that its knowledge of products, technology and applications expertise provides it with a competitive advantage over others in the industry. Customer requirements are supported by application engineers and technicians that are knowledgeable about the equipment s uses to ensure the right equipment is selected to meet the customer s needs.

 Operating Structure - TRS-RenTelco is supported by a centralized distribution and inventory center on the grounds of the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport in Texas. The Company believes that the centralization of servicing all customers in North America and internationally by TRS-RenTelco s experienced logistics teams provides a competitive advantage by minimizing transaction costs and enabling TRS-RenTelco to ensure customer requirements are met. 
 Asset Management - TRS-RenTelco s rental equipment inventory is serviced by an ISO 9001-2015 registered and compliant calibration laboratory that repairs and calibrates equipment ensuring that off rent equipment is ready to ship immediately to meet customers needs. TRS-RenTelco s team of technicians, product managers and sales personnel are continuously monitoring and analyzing the utilization of existing products, new technologies, general economic conditions and estimates of customer demand to ensure the right equipment is purchased and sold, at the right point in the equipment s technology life cycle. The Company believes this enables it to maximize utilization of equipment and the cash flow generated by the rental and sales revenue of each model of equipment. TRS-RenTelco strives to maintain strong relationships with equipment manufacturers, which enables it to leverage those relationships to gain rental opportunities.

 Market 
 Electronic test equipment rental is a market which we estimate has equipment on rent worldwide or available for rent with an aggregate original cost in excess of 1 billion. There is a broad customer base for the rental of such instruments, including aerospace, communications, defense, electrical contractor, electronics, industrial, installer contractor, network systems and research companies. 
 TRS-RenTelco markets its electronic test equipment throughout the United States, Canada, and, to a limited extent, other countries. TRS-RenTelco attracts customers through its outside sales force, website at www.TRSRenTelco.com, telemarketing program, trade show participation, paid internet search and electronic mail campaigns. A key part of the sales process is TRS-RenTelco s knowledgeable inside sales engineering team that effectively matches test equipment solutions to meet specific customer s requirements. 
 The Company believes that customers rent electronic test equipment for many reasons. Customers frequently need equipment for short-term projects, to evaluate new products, and for backup to avoid costly downtime. Delivery times for the purchase of such equipment can be lengthy; thus, renting allows the customer to obtain the equipment expeditiously. The Company also believes that the relative certainty of rental costs can facilitate cost control and be useful in the bidding of and pass-through of contract costs. Finally, renting rather than purchasing may better satisfy the customer s budgetary constraints. 
 Rentals 
 TRS-RenTelco rents electronic test equipment typically for rental periods of one to six months, although in some instances, rental terms can be up to a year or longer. Monthly rental rates typically are between 2 and 10 of the current manufacturers list price. TRS-RenTelco depreciates its equipment over 1 to 8 years with no residual value. 
 At December 31, 2022, TRS-RenTelco had an electronic test equipment rental inventory including accessories with an aggregate cost of 398.3 million. Utilization is calculated each month by dividing the cost of the rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding accessory equipment. Utilization was 59.4 as of December 31, 2022 and averaged 64.2 during the year. 
 Sales 
 Profit from equipment sales is a material component of TRS-RenTelco s overall annual earnings. Gross profit from sales of both used and new equipment over the last five years generally has ranged from approximately 20 to 23 of total annual gross profit for our electronics division. For 2022, gross profit on equipment sales was approximately 22 of total division gross profit. Equipment sales are driven by the turnover of older technology rental equipment, to maintain target utilization at a model number level, and new equipment sales opportunities. In 2022, approximately 16 of the electronic test equipment revenues were derived from sales. The largest electronic test equipment sale during 2022 represented 8 of electronic test equipment sales, 1 of the Company s consolidated sales and less than 1 of consolidated revenues. There is intense competition in the sales of electronic test equipment from a world-wide network of test equipment brokers and resellers, legacy rental companies, and equipment manufacturers. We believe the annual world-wide sales of electronic test equipment is in excess of 8.0 billion per year. 
 Seasonality 
 Rental activity may decline in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity due to holiday closures, particularly by larger companies, inclement weather and its impact on various field related communications equipment rentals, and companies operational recovery from holiday closures which may impact the start-up of new projects coming online in the first quarter. These factors may impact the quarterly results of each year s first and fourth quarter. 
 Competition 
 The electronic test equipment rental business is characterized by intense competition from several competitors, including Electro Rent Corporation, Continental Resources, and TestEquity, some of which may have access to greater financial and other resources than we do. TRS-RenTelco competes with these and other test equipment rental companies on the basis of product availability, price, service and reliability. Although no single competitor holds a dominant market share, we face intense competition from these established entities and new entrants in the market. Some of our competitors may offer similar equipment for lease, rental or sales at lower prices and may offer more extensive servicing, or financing options.

 - 11 - 
 
 Seasonality 
 Rental activity may decline in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity due to inclement weather in certain regions of the country impacting the industries that we serve. 
 Competition 
 The liquid and solid containment rental industry is highly competitive including national, regional and local companies. Some of our national competitors, notably United Rentals and Rain For Rent, may be larger than we are and may have greater financial and other resources than we have. Some of our competitors also have longer operating histories and lower cost basis of rental equipment than we have. In addition, certain of our competitors are more geographically diverse than we are and have greater name recognition among customers than we do. As a result, our competitors that have these advantages may be better able to attract and retain customers and provide their products and services at lower rental rates. Adler Tanks competes with these companies based upon product availability, product quality, price, service and reliability. Adler Tanks may encounter increased competition in the markets that it serves from existing competitors or from new market entrants in the future.

ITEM 1A.	RISK FACTORS 
 You should carefully consider the following discussion of various risks and uncertainties. We believe these risk factors are the most relevant to our business and could cause our results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made by us. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be seriously harmed if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occur or materialize. In that event, the market price for our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR STRATEGY AND OPERATION: 
 Our future operating results may fluctuate, fail to match past performance or fail to meet expectations, which may result in a decrease in our stock price. 
 Our operating results may fluctuate in the future, may fail to match our past performance or fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors. Our results and related ratios, such as gross margin, operating income percentage and effective tax rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control including but not limited to: 
 general economic conditions in the geographies and industries where we rent and sell our products; 

legislative and educational policies where we rent and sell our products; 

the budgetary constraints of our customers; 

seasonality of our rental businesses and our end-markets; 

success of our strategic growth initiatives; 

costs associated with the launching or integration of new or acquired businesses; 

the timing and type of equipment purchases, rentals and sales; 

the nature and duration of the equipment needs of our customers; 

the timing of new product introductions by us, our suppliers and our competitors; 

the volume, timing and mix of maintenance and repair work on our rental equipment; 

supply chain delays or disruptions; 

our equipment mix, availability, utilization and pricing; 

inflation in the cost of materials, labor and new rental equipment; 

the mix, by state and country, of our revenues, personnel and assets; 

rental equipment impairment from excess, obsolete or damaged equipment; 

movements in interest rates or tax rates; 

changes in, and application of, accounting rules; 

changes in the regulations applicable to us; and 

litigation matters. 

As a result of these factors, our historical financial results are not necessarily indicative of our future results or stock price. 
 Our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate in the future, which may result in a decline in the value of your investment in our common stock. 
 The market price of our common stock fluctuates on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and is likely to be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to: 
 our operating performance and the performance of our competitors, and in particular any variations in our operating results or dividend rate from our stated guidance or from investors expectations; 

any changes in general conditions in the global economy, the industries in which we operate or the global financial markets; 

investors reaction to our press releases, public announcements or filings with the SEC; 

the stock price performance of our competitors or other comparable companies; 

- 15 - 

any changes in research analysts coverage, recommendations or earnings estimates for us or for the stocks of other companies in our industry; 

any sales of common stock by our directors, executive officers and our other large shareholders, particularly in light of the limited trading volume of our stock; 

any merger and acquisition activity that involves us or our competitors; and 

other announcements or developments affecting us, our industry, customers, suppliers or competitors. 

In addition, in recent years the U.S. stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Additionally, the most recent global credit crisis adversely affected the prices of most publicly traded stocks as many stockholders became more willing to divest their stock holdings at lower values to increase their cash flow and reduce exposure to such fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations and any other negative economic trends may cause declines in the market price of our common stock and may be based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our Company or its performance, and these fluctuations and trends could materially reduce our stock price. 
 The impact of COVID-19 on our operations, and the operations of our customers, suppliers and logistics providers, may harm our business. 
 We continue to monitor the ongoing impact of COVID-19 outbreak around the globe. This includes evaluating the impact on our customers, suppliers, and logistics providers as well as evaluating governmental actions being taken to curtail the spread of the virus. Significant uncertainty continues to exist concerning the magnitude of the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and related variants. While the Company s operating segments and branch locations currently continue to operate, the Company s results of operations may be negatively impacted by project delays, supply chain delays or disruptions; elevated costs for materials and labor; early returns of equipment currently on rent with customers; overall decreased customer demand for new rental orders, rental related services and sales of new and used rental equipment; and payment delay, or non-payment, by customers who are significantly impacted by COVID-19. 
 Our ability to retain our executive management and to recruit, retain and motivate key qualified employees is critical to the success of our business. 
 If we cannot successfully recruit and retain qualified personnel, our operating results and stock price may suffer. We believe that our success is directly linked to the competent people in our organization, including our executive officers, senior managers and other key personnel, and in particular, Joe Hanna, our Chief Executive Officer. Personnel turnover can be costly and could materially and adversely impact our operating results and can potentially jeopardize the success of our current strategic initiatives. We need to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to replace personnel when turnover occurs, as well as add to our staff levels as growth occurs. Our business and stock price likely will suffer if we are unable to fill, or experience delays in filling open positions, or fail to retain key personnel. 
 Failure by third parties to manufacture and deliver our products to our specifications or on a timely basis may harm our reputation and financial condition. 
 We depend on third parties to manufacture our products even though we are able to purchase products from a variety of third-party suppliers. In the future, we may be limited as to the number of third-party suppliers for some of our products. Although in general we make advance purchases of some products to help ensure an adequate supply, currently we do not have any long-term purchase contracts with any third-party supplier. We may experience supply problems as a result of financial or operating difficulties or failure of our suppliers, or shortages and discontinuations resulting from product obsolescence or other shortages or allocations by our suppliers. Unfavorable economic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers or the terms on which we purchase products. In the future, we may not be able to negotiate arrangements with third parties to secure products that we require in sufficient quantities or on reasonable terms. If we cannot negotiate arrangements with third parties to produce our products or if the third parties fail to produce our products to our specifications or in a timely manner, our reputation and financial condition could be harmed. 
 We are subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security which could subject us to liability, reputational damage or interrupt the operation of our business. 
 We rely upon our information technology systems and infrastructure for our business. We sustained an immaterial cybersecurity attack in 2021 involving ransomware that impacted certain of our systems but was unsuccessful in its ability to disrupt our network. Our investigation revealed that an unauthorized third party copied some personal information relating to certain current and former employees, directors, contractor workers and their dependents and certain other persons. Upon detection, we promptly undertook steps 
 - 16 - 

to address the incident, restored network systems and resumed normal operations. The attack did not result in any material disruption to our operations or ability to service our customers and did not affect our financial performance. 
 In the future, we could experience additional breaches of our security measures resulting in the theft of confidential information or reputational damage from industrial espionage attacks, malware or other cyber-attacks, which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers. Similarly, additional data privacy breaches by those who access our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to us, our employees, customers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. 
 The immaterial breach of our information technology system and any future breaches could subject us to reputational damage. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our data and information technology systems will prevent future breaches in our systems (or that of our third-party providers) that could adversely affect our business and result in financial and reputational harm to us, theft of trade secrets and other proprietary information, legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties. 
 Disruptions in our information technology systems or failure to protect these systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, if these systems fail, become unavailable for any period of time or are not upgraded, this could limit our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations and adversely affect our operations. 
 Our information technology systems facilitate our ability to transact business, monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions. We sustained an immaterial cybersecurity attack in 2021 involving ransomware that impacted certain of our systems, but was unsuccessful in its ability to disrupt our network. Upon detection, we promptly undertook steps to address the incident, restored network systems and resumed normal operations. Any future cybersecurity attack causing disruption in our information technology systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively transact business, monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions in a timely manner. 
 In addition, because of recent advances in technology and well-known efforts on the part of computer hackers and cyber-terrorists to breach data security of companies, we face risks associated with failure to adequately protect critical corporate, customer and employee data, which could adversely impact our customer relationships, our reputation, and even violate privacy laws. As part of our business, we develop, receive and retain confidential data about our company and our customers. 
 Further, the delay or failure to implement information system upgrades and new systems effectively could disrupt our business, distract management s focus and attention from our business operations and growth initiatives, and increase our implementation and operating costs, any of which could negatively impact our operations and operating results. 
 We have engaged in acquisitions and may engage in future acquisitions that could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and business. 
 In the second quarter 2021, we acquired the assets of Design Space Modular Buildings PNW, LP Design Space ), a provider of modular buildings and portable storage containers for rental and sale to customers in the West and Pacific Northwest states in the U.S. and GRS Holding LLC, DBA Kitchens to Go Kitchens To Go ), a provider of interim and permanent modular solutions for foodservice providers that require flexible facilities to continue or expand operations. In the first quarter of 2023, the Company acquired Vesta Modular, a portfolio company of Kinderhook Industries, that is a leading provider of temporary and permanent modular space solutions. We anticipate that we will continue to consider acquisitions in the future that meet our strategic growth plans. We are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition will be completed. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following: 
 difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies; 

diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of our business; 

difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets may have stronger market positions; 

difficulties in complying with regulations applicable to any acquired business, such as environmental regulations, and managing risks related to an acquired business; 

timely completion of necessary financing and required amendments, if any, to existing agreements; 

an inability to implement uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; 

- 17 - 

undiscovered and unknown problems, defects, damaged assets liabilities, or other issues related to any acquisition that become known to us only after the acquisition; 

negative reactions from our customers to an acquisition; 

disruptions among employees related to any acquisition which may erode employee morale; 

loss of key employees, including costly litigation resulting from the termination of those employees; 

an inability to realize cost efficiencies or synergies that we may anticipate when selecting acquisition candidates; 

recording of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to future impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges; 

incurring amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets; and 

becoming subject to litigation. 

Acquisitions are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our recent and future acquisitions will be successful or will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. The success of our acquisition strategy depends upon our ability to successfully complete acquisitions and integrate any businesses that we acquire into our existing business. The difficulties of integration could be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; maintaining acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies; integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds; combining different corporate cultures; and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management and other personnel. In addition, if we consummate one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration consists of stock or other securities, our existing shareholders ownership could be diluted significantly. If we were to proceed with one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration included cash, we could be required to use, to the extent available, a substantial portion of our Credit Facility. If we increase the amount borrowed against our available credit line, we would increase the risk of breaching the covenants under our credit facilities with our lenders. In addition, it would limit our ability to make other investments, or we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing. Any of these items could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment, and we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected. 
 A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including reaching an agreement with potential buyers on terms we deem attractive, as well as our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities, and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the assets to be divested from the assets that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. These efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits of any divestiture transaction, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. Furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 If we determine that our goodwill and intangible assets have become impaired, we may incur impairment charges, which would negatively impact our operating results. 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 173.4 million of goodwill and intangible assets, net, on our consolidated balance sheets. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we assess potential impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets at least annually, as well as on an interim basis to the extent that factors or indicators become apparent that could reduce the fair value of any of our businesses below book value. Impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset, negative industry or economic trends and significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results.

Our rental equipment is subject to residual value risk upon disposition and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect. 
 The market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold. The market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors, including: 
 the market price for new equipment of a like kind; 

the age of the equipment at the time it is sold, as well as wear and tear on the equipment relative to its age; 

the supply of used equipment on the market; 

technological advances relating to the equipment; 

worldwide and domestic demand for used equipment; and 

general economic conditions. 

We include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold. Changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense, as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of equipment. Sales of our used rental equipment at prices that fall significantly below our projections or in lesser quantities than we anticipate will have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. 
 If we do not effectively manage our credit risk, collect on our accounts receivable or recover our rental equipment from our customers sites, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. 
 We generally rent and sell to customers on 30 day payment terms, individually perform credit evaluation procedures on our customers for each transaction and require security deposits or other forms of security from our customers when a significant credit risk is identified. Historically, accounts receivable write-offs and write-offs related to equipment not returned by customers have not been significant and have averaged less than 1 of total revenues over the last five years. If economic conditions deteriorate, we may see an increase in bad debt relative to historical levels, which may materially and adversely affect our operations. Business segments that experience significant market disruptions or declines may experience increased customer credit risk and higher bad debt expense. Failure to manage our credit risk and receive timely payments on our customer accounts receivable may result in write-offs and/or loss of equipment, particularly electronic test equipment. If we are not able to effectively manage credit risk issues, or if a large number of our customers should have financial difficulties at the same time, our receivables and equipment losses could increase above historical levels. If this should occur, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 
 Effective management of our rental assets is vital to our business. If we are not successful in these efforts, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 
 Our modular, electronics and liquid and solid containment rental products have long useful lives and managing those assets is a critical element to each of our rental businesses. Generally, we design units and find manufacturers to build them to our specifications for our modular and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. Modular asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life that anticipates the needs of our customers, including anticipating potential changes in legislation, regulations, building codes and local permitting in the various markets in which the Company operates. Electronic test equipment asset management requires understanding, selecting and investing in equipment technologies that support market demand, including anticipating technological advances and changes in manufacturers selling prices. Liquid and solid containment asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life, using quality components and repairing and maintaining the products to prevent leaks. For each of our modular, electronic test equipment and liquid and solid containment assets, we must successfully maintain and repair this equipment cost-effectively to maximize the useful life of the products and the level of proceeds from the sale of such products. To the extent that we are unable to do so, our result of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
 The nature of our businesses, including the ownership of industrial property, exposes us to the risk of litigation and liability under environmental, health and safety and products liability laws. Violations of environmental or health and safety related laws or associated liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We are subject to national, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, solid and liquid waste and hazardous substances handling, storage and disposal and employee health and safety. These laws and regulations are complex and frequently change. We could incur unexpected costs, penalties and other civil and criminal liability if we fail to comply with applicable environmental or health and safety laws. We also could incur costs or liabilities related to waste disposal or remediating soil or groundwater contamination at our properties, at our customers properties or at third party landfill and disposal sites. These liabilities can be imposed on the parties generating, transporting or disposing of such substances or on the owner or operator of any affected property, often without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous substances. 
 - 19 - 

Several aspects of our businesses involve risks of environmental and health and safety liability. For example, our operations involve the use of petroleum products, solvents and other hazardous substances in the construction and maintaining of modular buildings and for fueling and maintaining our delivery trucks and vehicles. We also own, transport and rent tanks and boxes in which waste materials are placed by our customers. The historical operations at some of our previously or currently owned or leased and newly acquired or leased properties may have resulted in undiscovered soil or groundwater contamination or historical non-compliance by third parties for which we could be held liable. Future events, such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement, or the discovery of currently unknown contamination or non-compliance, may also give rise to liabilities or other claims based on these operations that may be material. In addition, compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws and regulations may require significant capital or operational expenditures or changes to our operations. 
 Accordingly, in addition to potential penalties for non-compliance, we may become liable, either contractually or by operation of law, for investigation, remediation and monitoring costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by us, or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to our ownership or operation of the property. In addition, certain parties may be held liable for more than their fair share of environmental investigation and cleanup costs. Contamination and exposure to hazardous substances or other contaminants such as mold can also result in claims for remediation or damages, including personal injury, property damage, and natural resources damage claims. Although expenses related to environmental compliance, health and safety issues, and related matters have not been material to date, we cannot assure that we will not have to make significant expenditures in the future in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Violations of environmental or health and safety related laws or associated liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 In general, litigation in the industries in which we operate, including class actions that seek substantial damages, arises with increasing frequency. Enforcement of environmental and health and safety requirements is also frequent. Such proceedings are invariably expensive, regardless of the merit of the plaintiffs or prosecutors claims. We may be named as a defendant in the future, and there can be no assurance, irrespective of the merit of such future actions, that we will not be required to make substantial settlement payments in the future. Further, a significant portion of our business is conducted in California which is one of the most highly regulated and litigious states in the country. Therefore, our potential exposure to losses and expenses due to new laws, regulations or litigation may be greater than companies with a less significant California presence. 
 The nature of our business also subjects us to property damage and product liability claims, especially in connection with our modular buildings and tank and box rental businesses. Although we maintain liability coverage that we believe is commercially reasonable, an unusually large property damage or product liability claim or a series of claims could exceed our insurance coverage or result in damage to our reputation. 
 Our routine business activities expose us to risk of litigation from employees, vendors and other third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 We may be subject to claims arising from disputes with employees, vendors and other third parties in the normal course of our business; these risks may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. If the plaintiffs in any suits against us were to successfully prosecute their claims, or if we were to settle any such suits by making significant payments to the plaintiffs, our operating results and financial condition would be harmed. Even if the outcome of a claim proves favorable to us, litigation can be time consuming and costly and may divert management resources. In addition, our organizational documents require us to indemnify our senior executives to the maximum extent permitted by California law. We maintain directors and officers liability insurance that we believe is commercially reasonable in connection with such obligations, but if our senior executives were named in any lawsuit, our indemnification obligations could magnify the costs of these suits and/or exceed the coverage of such policies. 
 If we suffer loss to our facilities, equipment or distribution system due to catastrophe, our insurance policies could be inadequate or depleted, our operations could be seriously harmed, which could negatively affect our operating results. 
 Our facilities, rental equipment and distribution systems may be subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, hurricane, earthquake, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. In particular, our headquarters, three operating facilities, and certain of our rental equipment are located in areas of California, with above average seismic activity and could be subject to catastrophic loss caused by an earthquake. Our rental equipment and facilities in Texas, Louisiana, Florida, North Carolina and Georgia are located in areas subject to hurricanes and other tropical storms. In addition to customers insurance on rented equipment, we carry property insurance on our rental equipment in inventory and operating facilities as well as business interruption insurance. We believe our insurance policies have adequate limits and deductibles to mitigate the potential loss exposure of our business. We do not maintain financial reserves for policy deductibles and our insurance policies contain exclusions that are customary for our industry, including exclusions for earthquakes, flood and terrorism. If any of our facilities or a significant amount of our rental equipment were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay orders, shipments and revenue recognition and result in expenses to repair or replace the damaged rental equipment and facility not covered by insurance, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

INTEREST RATE AND INDEBTEDNESS RISKS: 
 Our debt instruments contain covenants that restrict or prohibit our ability to enter into a variety of transactions and may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs. If we have an event of default under these instruments, our indebtedness could be accelerated, and we may not be able to refinance such indebtedness or make the required accelerated payments. 
 The agreements governing our Series C, D and E Senior Notes (as defined and more fully described under the heading Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources and our Credit Facility contain various covenants that limit our discretion in operating our business. In particular, we are limited in our ability to merge, consolidate, reorganize or transfer substantially all of our assets, make investments, pay dividends or distributions, redeem or repurchase stock, change the nature of our business, enter into transactions with affiliates, incur indebtedness and create liens on our assets to secure debt. In addition, we are required to meet certain financial covenants under these instruments. These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make strategic acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand economic downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise. 
 A failure to comply with the restrictions contained in these agreements could lead to an event of default, which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness. In the event of an acceleration, we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to refinance our indebtedness or make any required accelerated payments. If we default on our indebtedness, our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 The majority of our indebtedness is subject to variable interest rates, which makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates, which could negatively affect our net income. 
 Our indebtedness exposes us to interest rate increases because the majority of our indebtedness is subject to variable rates. At present, we do not have any derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or hedges to mitigate interest rate variability. The interest rates under our credit facilities are reset at varying periods. These interest rate adjustments could cause periodic fluctuations in our operating results and cash flows. Our annual debt service obligations increase by approximately 3.1 million per year for each 1 increase in the average interest rate we pay based on the 313.8 million balance of variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2022. If interest rates rise in the future, and, particularly if they rise significantly, interest expense will increase and our net income will be negatively affected. 
 GENERAL RISKS: 
 Our effective tax rate may change and become less predictable as our business expands, or as a result of federal and state tax law changes, making our future earnings less predictable. 
 We continue to consider expansion opportunities domestically and internationally for our rental businesses. Since the Company s effective tax rate depends on business levels, personnel and assets located in various jurisdictions, further expansion into new markets or acquisitions may change the effective tax rate in the future and may make it, and consequently our earnings, less predictable going forward. Further, the enactment of future tax law changes by federal and state taxing authorities may impact the Company s current period tax provision and its deferred tax liabilities. In addition, the amount and timing of stock-based compensation may also impact the Company s current tax provision. 
 Changes in financial accounting standards may cause lower than expected operating results and affect our reported results of operations. 
 Changes in accounting standards and their application may have a significant effect on our reported results on a going-forward basis and may also affect the recording and disclosure of previously reported transactions. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. 
 Adverse economic conditions in the United States and globally, including the potential onset of recession, could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
 Adverse macroeconomic conditions in the United States and globally, including inflation, slower than expected growth or recession, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tightening of the credit markets, higher interest rates and currency fluctuations, could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. These factors could negatively affect demand for our business. 
 Adverse economic conditions in the United States and globally have from time to time caused or exacerbated significant slowdowns in our industry and in the markets in which we operate, which have adversely affected our business and results of operations. 
 - 21 - 

Macroeconomic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue, gross margin and expenses, and may make it more difficult to refinance debt. 
 Furthermore, sustained uncertainty about, or worsening of, current global economic conditions, including further escalation of tensions between Russia and Western countries, as well as further escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China, could result in a global economic slowdown and long-term changes to global trade. Any or all of these factors could negatively affect our revenue and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth. 
 Environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters may impact our business and reputation. 
 Governmental authorities, non-governmental organizations, customers, investors, external stakeholders and employees are increasingly sensitive to ESG concerns. This focus on ESG concerns may lead to new requirements that could result in increased costs for our business. Our ability to compete could also be affected by changing customer preferences and requirements, such as growing demand for more environmentally friendly products, supplier practices, or by failure to meet such customer expectations or demand. We risk negative shareholder reaction, including from proxy advisory services, as well as damage to our reputation, if we do not act responsibly, or if we are perceived to not be acting responsibly in key ESG areas. If we do not meet the ESG expectations of our investors, customers and other stakeholders, we could experience reduced demand for our products, loss of customers, and other negative impacts on our business and results of operations. 
 SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO OUR RELOCATABLE MODULAR BUILDINGS BUSINESS SEGMENT: 
 Significant reductions of, or delays in, funding to public schools have caused the demand and pricing for our modular classroom units to decline, which has in the past caused, and may cause in the future, a reduction in our revenues and profitability. 
 Rentals and sales of modular buildings to public school districts for use as classrooms, restroom buildings, and administrative offices for K-12 represent a significant portion of Mobile Modular s rental and sales revenues. Funding for public school facilities is derived from a variety of sources including the passage of both statewide and local facility bond measures, developer fees and various taxes levied to support school operating budgets. Many of these funding sources are subject to financial and political considerations, which vary from district to district and are not tied to demand. Historically, we have benefited from the passage of statewide and local facility bond measures and believe these are essential to our business. 
 The state of California is our largest market for classroom rentals. The strength of this market depends heavily on public funding from voter passage of both state and local facility bond measures, and the ability of the state to sell such bonds in the public market. A lack of passage of state and local facility bond measures, or the inability to sell bonds in the public markets in the future could reduce our revenues and operating income, and consequently have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition. Furthermore, even if voters have approved facility bond measures and the state has raised bond funds, there is no guarantee that individual school projects will be funded in a timely manner. 
 As a consequence of the most recent economic recession, many states and local governments experienced large budget deficits resulting in severe budgetary constraints among public school districts. To the extent public school districts funding is reduced for the rental and purchase of modular buildings, our business could be harmed and our results of operations negatively impacted. We believe that interruptions or delays in the passage of facility bond measures or completion of state budgets, an insufficient amount of state funding, a significant reduction of funding to public schools, or changes negatively impacting enrollment may reduce the rental and sale demand for our educational products. Any reductions in funding available to the school districts from the states in which we do business may cause school districts to experience budget shortfalls and to reduce their demand for our products despite growing student populations, class size reduction initiatives and modernization and reconstruction project needs, which could reduce our revenues and operating income and consequently have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition. 
 Public policies that create demand for our products and services may change, resulting in decreased demand for or the pricing of our products and services, which could negatively affect our revenues and operating income. 
 Various states that we operate enacted laws and constitutional amendments to provide funding for school districts to limit the number of students that may be grouped in a single classroom. School districts with class sizes in excess of state limits have been and continue to be a significant source of our demand for modular classrooms. In California, efforts to address aging infrastructure and deferred maintenance have resulted in modernization and reconstruction projects by public school districts including seismic retrofitting, asbestos abatement and various building repairs and upgrades, which has been another source of demand for our modular classrooms. The most recent economic recession caused state and local budget shortfalls, which reduced school districts funding and their ability to comply with state class size reduction requirements. If educational priorities and policies shift away from class-size reduction or modernization and reconstruction projects, demand and pricing for our products and services may decline, not grow as quickly as, or not reach the levels that we anticipate. Significant equipment returns may result in lower utilization until equipment can be redeployed or sold, which may cause rental rates to decline and negatively affect our revenues and operating income. 
 - 22 - 

Failure to comply with applicable regulations could harm our business and financial condition, resulting in lower operating results and cash flows. 
 Similar to conventionally constructed buildings, the modular building industry, including the manufacturers and lessors of portable classrooms, are subject to regulations by multiple governmental agencies at the federal, state and local level relating to environmental, zoning, health, safety, energy efficiency, labor and transportation matters, among other matters. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations could impact our business or harm our reputation and result in higher capital or operating expenditures or the imposition of penalties or restrictions on our operations. 
 As with conventional construction, typically new codes and regulations are not retroactively applied. Nonetheless, new governmental regulations in these or other areas may increase our acquisition cost of new rental equipment, limit the use of or make obsolete some of our existing equipment, or increase our costs of rental operations. 
 Building codes are generally reviewed every three years. All aspects of a given code are subject to change including, but not limited to, such items as structural specifications for earthquake safety, energy efficiency and environmental standards, fire and life safety, transportation, lighting and noise limits. 
 Compliance with building codes and regulations entails a certain amount of risk as state and local government authorities do not necessarily interpret building codes and regulations in a consistent manner, particularly where applicable regulations may be unclear and subject to interpretation. These regulations often provide broad discretion to governmental authorities that oversee these matters, which can result in unanticipated delays or increases in the cost of compliance in particular markets. The construction and modular industries have developed many best practices which are constantly evolving. Some of our peers and competitors may adopt practices that are more or less stringent than the Company s. When, and if, regulatory standards are clarified, the effect of the clarification may be to impose rules on our business and practices retroactively, at which time, we may not be in compliance with such regulations and we may be required to incur costly remediation. If we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers, our profitability, operating cash flows and financial condition could be negatively impacted. 
 Expansions of our modular operations into new markets may negatively affect our operating results. 
 In the past we have expanded our modular operations into new geographies and states. There are risks inherent in the undertaking of such expansion, including the risk of revenue from the business in any new markets not meeting our expectations, higher than expected costs in entering these new markets, risk associated with compliance with applicable state and local laws and regulations, response by competitors and unanticipated consequences of expansion. In addition, expansion into new markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions. Expansion of our operations into new markets will require a significant amount of attention from our management, a commitment of financial resources and will require us to add qualified management in these markets, which may negatively impact our operating results. 
 We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts. These laws and regulations expose us to business volatility and risks, including government budgeting cycles and appropriations, potential early termination of contracts, procurement regulations, governmental policy shifts, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties. Furthermore, these laws and regulations make these government contracts more favorable to government entities than other third parties and any changes in these laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business. 
 McGrath derives a portion of its revenues from contracts with U.S. federal government entities, government prime contractors, state entities and local entities, including school districts. Contracts with government entities are subject to budgetary constraints, and our continued performance under our contracts with these agencies and their prime contractors, or award of additional contracts from these agencies or their prime contractors, could be jeopardized by spending reductions or budget cutbacks at these agencies. Such contracts are also subject to unique laws and regulations, and the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to government contracting or changes to existing laws or regulations. New laws, regulations or procurement requirements, or changes to current ones, can significantly increase our costs and risks and reduce our profitability. In addition, any failure on the part of the company to comply with applicable government contract laws and regulations might result in administrative penalties or even in the termination or suspension of these contracts and as a result, the loss of the related revenues, which would harm our business. 
 Furthermore, the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts such as clauses that allow government entities not to perform on contractual obligations in the case of a lack of fiscal funding. Also, in the educational markets we serve, we are able to utilize piggyback contracts in marketing our products and services and ultimately to book business. The term piggyback contract refers to contracts for portable classrooms or other products entered into by public school districts following a formal bid process that allows for the use of the same contract terms and conditions with the successful vendor by other public school districts. As a result, piggyback contracts allow us to more readily book orders from our government customers, primarily public school districts, and to reduce the administrative expense associated with booking these orders. The governmental statutes and regulations that allow for use of piggyback contracts are subject to change or elimination in their entirety. A change in the manner of 
 - 23 - 

use or the elimination of piggyback contracts would likely negatively impact our ability to book new business from these government customers and could cause our administrative expenses related to processing these orders to increase significantly. In addition, any failure to comply with these laws and regulations might result in administrative penalties or even in the suspension of these contracts and as a result, the loss of the related revenues which would harm our business and results from operations. 
 Seasonality of our educational business may have adverse consequences for our business. 
 A significant portion of the modular sale and rental revenues is derived from the educational market. Typically, during each calendar year, our highest numbers of classrooms are shipped for rental and sale orders during the second and third quarters for delivery and installation prior to the start of the upcoming school year. The majority of classrooms shipped in the second and third quarters have rental start dates during the third quarter, thereby making the fourth quarter the first full quarter of rental revenues recognized for these transactions. Although this is the historical seasonality of our business, it is subject to change or may not meet our expectations, which may have adverse consequences for our business. 
 We face strong competition in our modular building markets and we may not be able to effectively compete. 
 The modular building leasing industry is highly competitive in our states of operation and we expect it to remain so. The competitive market in which we operate may prevent us from raising rental fees or sales prices to pass any increased costs on to our customers. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including equipment availability, quality, price, service, reliability, appearance, functionality and delivery terms. We may experience pricing pressures in our areas of operation in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices. 
 Some of our competitors in the modular building leasing industry, notably WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Corp, have a greater range of products and services, greater financial and marketing resources, larger customer bases, and greater name recognition than we have. These combined competitors may be better able to respond to changes in the relocatable modular building market, to finance acquisitions, to fund internal growth and to compete for market share, any of which could harm our business. 
 We may not be able to quickly redeploy modular units returning from leases, which could negatively affect our financial performance and our ability to expand, or utilize, our rental fleet. 
 As of December 31, 2022, 63 of our modular portfolio had equipment on rent for periods exceeding the original committed term. Generally, when a customer continues to rent the modular units beyond the contractual term, the equipment rents on a month-to-month basis. If a significant number of our rented modular units were returned during a short period of time, particularly those units that are rented on a month-to-month basis, a large supply of units would need to be remarketed. Our failure to effectively remarket a large influx of units returning from leases could negatively affect our financial performance and our ability to continue expanding our rental fleet. In addition, if returned units stay off rent for an extended period of time, we may incur additional costs to securely store and maintain them. 
 Significant increases in raw material and labor costs could increase our acquisition cost of new modular rental units and repair and maintenance costs of our fleet, which would increase our operating costs and harm our profitability. 
 We incur labor costs and purchase raw materials, including lumber, siding and roofing and other products to perform periodic repairs, modifications and refurbishments to maintain physical conditions of our modular units. The volume, timing and mix of maintenance and repair work on our rental equipment may vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Generally, increases in labor and raw material costs will also increase the acquisition cost of new modular units and increase the repair and maintenance costs of our fleet. We also maintain a fleet of service trucks and use subcontractor companies for the delivery, set-up, return delivery and dismantle of modulars for our customers. We rely on our subcontractor service companies to meet customer demands for timely shipment and return, and the loss or inadequate number of subcontractor service companies may cause prices to increase, while negatively impacting our reputation and operating performance. During periods of rising prices for labor, raw materials or fuel, and in particular, when the prices increase rapidly or to levels significantly higher than normal, we may incur significant increases in our acquisition costs for new modular units and incur higher operating costs that we may not be able to recoup from our customers, which would reduce our profitability. 
 Failure by third parties to manufacture our products timely or properly may harm our reputation and financial condition. 
 We are dependent on third parties to manufacture our products even though we are able to purchase products from a variety of third-party suppliers. Mobile Modular purchases new modulars from various manufacturers who build to Mobile Modular s design specifications. With the exception of Enviroplex, none of the principal suppliers are affiliated with the Company. During 2022, Mobile Modular purchased 30 of its modular product from one manufacturer. The Company believes that the loss of any of its primary manufacturers of modulars could have an adverse effect on its operations since Mobile Modular could experience higher prices and longer delivery lead times for modular product until other manufacturers were able to increase their production capacity. 
 - 24 - 

Failure to properly design, manufacture, repair and maintain the modular product may result in impairment charges, potential litigation and reduction of our operating results and cash flows. 
 We estimate the useful life of the modular product to be 18 years with a residual value of 50 . However, proper design, manufacture, repairs and maintenance of the modular product during our ownership is required for the product to reach the estimated useful life of 18 years with a residual value of 50 . If we do not appropriately manage the design, manufacture, repair and maintenance of our modular product, or otherwise delay or defer such repair or maintenance, we may be required to incur impairment charges for equipment that is beyond economic repair costs or incur significant capital expenditures to acquire new modular product to serve demand. In addition, such failures may result in personal injury or property damage claims, including claims based on presence of mold, and termination of leases or contracts by customers. Costs of contract performance, potential litigation, and profits lost from termination could accordingly reduce our future operating results and cash flows. 
 Our warranty costs may increase and warranty claims could damage our reputation and negatively impact our revenues and operating income. 
 Sales of new relocatable modular buildings not manufactured by us are typically covered by warranties provided by the manufacturer of the products sold. We provide ninety-day warranties on certain modular sales of used rental units and one-year warranties on equipment manufactured by our Enviroplex subsidiary. Historically, our warranty costs have not been significant, and we monitor the quality of our products closely. If a defect were to arise in the installation of our equipment at the customer s facilities or in the equipment acquired from our suppliers or by our Enviroplex subsidiary, we may experience increased warranty claims. Such claims could disrupt our sales operations, damage our reputation and require costly repairs or other remedies, negatively impacting revenues and operating income. 
 SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO OUR ELECTRONIC TEST EQUIPMENT BUSINESS SEGMENT: 
 Market risk and cyclical downturns in the industries using test equipment may result in periods of low demand for our product resulting in excess inventory, impairment charges and reduction of our operating results and cash flows. 
 TRS-RenTelco s revenues are derived from the rental and sale of general purpose and communications test equipment to a broad range of companies, from Fortune 500 to middle and smaller market companies, in the aerospace, defense, communications, manufacturing and semiconductor industries. Electronic test equipment rental and sales revenues are primarily affected by the business activity within these industries related to research and development, manufacturing, and communication infrastructure installation and maintenance. Historically, these industries have been cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns, which can have a material adverse impact on the industry s demand for equipment, including our rental electronic test equipment. In addition, the severity and length of any downturn in an industry may also affect overall access to capital, which could adversely affect our customers and result in excess inventory and impairment charges. During periods of reduced and declining demand for test equipment, we are exposed to additional receivable risk from non-payment and may need to rapidly align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions, which may negatively impact our operating results and cash flows. 
 Seasonality of our electronic test equipment business may impact quarterly results. 
 Generally, rental activity declines in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity due to holiday closures, particularly by larger companies, inclement weather and its impact on various field related communications equipment rentals, and companies operational recovery from holiday closures which may impact the start-up of new projects coming online in the first quarter. These seasonal factors historically have impacted quarterly results in each year s first and fourth quarter, but we are unable to predict how such factors may impact future periods. 
 Our rental test equipment may become obsolete or may no longer be supported by a manufacturer, which could result in an impairment charge. 
 Electronic test equipment is characterized by changing technology and evolving industry standards that may render our existing equipment obsolete through new product introductions, or enhancements, before the end of its anticipated useful life, causing us to incur impairment charges. We must anticipate and keep pace with the introduction of new hardware, software and networking technologies and acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers. 
 Additionally, some manufacturers of our equipment may be acquired or cease to exist, resulting in a future lack of support for equipment purchased from those manufacturers. This could result in the remaining useful life becoming shorter, causing us to incur an impairment charge. We monitor our manufacturers capacity to support their products and the introduction of new technologies, and we acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers. However, any prolonged economic downturn could result in unexpected bankruptcies or reduced support from our manufacturers. Failure to properly select, manage and respond to 
 - 25 - 

the technological needs of our customers and changes to our products through their technology life cycle may cause certain electronic test equipment to become obsolete, resulting in impairment charges, which may negatively impact operating results and cash flows. 
 If we do not effectively compete in the rental equipment market, our operating results will be materially and adversely affected. 
 The electronic test equipment rental business is characterized by intense competition from several competitors, including Electro Rent Corporation, Continental Resources and TestEquity, some of which may have access to greater financial and other resources than we do. Although no single competitor holds a dominant market share, we face competition from these established entities and new entrants in the market. We believe that we anticipate and keep pace with the introduction of new products and acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including product availability, price, service and reliability. Some of our competitors may offer similar equipment for lease, rental or sale at lower prices and may offer more extensive servicing, or financing options. Failure to adequately forecast the adoption of, and demand for, new or existing products may cause us not to meet our customers equipment requirements and may materially and adversely affect our operating results. 
 If we are not able to obtain equipment at favorable rates, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results and reputation. 
 The majority of our rental equipment portfolio is comprised of general purpose test and measurement instruments purchased from leading manufacturers such as Keysight Technologies, Rhode Schwarz and Tektronix, a division of Fortive Corporation. We depend on purchasing equipment from these manufacturers and suppliers for use as our rental equipment. If, in the future, we are not able to purchase necessary equipment from one or more of these suppliers on favorable terms, we may not be able to meet our customers demands in a timely manner or for a rental rate that generates a profit. If this should occur, we may not be able to secure necessary equipment from an alternative source on acceptable terms and our business and reputation may be materially and adversely affected. 
 If we are not able to anticipate and mitigate the risks associated with operating internationally, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results. 
 Currently, total foreign country customers and operations account for less than 10 of the Company s revenues. In recent years some of our customers have expanded their international operations faster than domestic operations, and this trend may continue. Over time, the amount of our international business may increase if we focus on international market opportunities. Operating in foreign countries subjects the Company to additional risks, any of which may adversely impact our future operating results, including: 
 international political, economic and legal conditions including tariffs and trade barriers; 

our ability to comply with customs, anti-corruption, import/export and other trade compliance regulations, together with any unexpected changes in such regulations; 

greater difficulty in our ability to recover rental equipment and obtain payment of the related trade receivables; 

additional costs to establish and maintain international subsidiaries and related operations; 

difficulties in attracting and retaining staff and business partners to operate internationally; 

language and cultural barriers; 

seasonal reductions in business activities in the countries where our international customers are located; 

difficulty with the integration of foreign operations; 

longer payment cycles; 

currency fluctuations; and 

potential adverse tax consequences. 

Unfavorable currency exchange rates may negatively impact our financial results in U.S. dollar terms. 
 We receive revenues in Canadian dollars from our business activities in Canada. Conducting business in currencies other than U.S. dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. If the currency exchange rates change unfavorably, the value of net receivables we receive in foreign currencies and later convert to U.S. dollars after the unfavorable change would be diminished. This could have a negative impact on our reported operating results. We currently do not engage in hedging strategies to mitigate this risk.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 Results of Operations 
 General 
 The Company, incorporated in 1979, is a leading rental provider of relocatable modular buildings for classroom and office space, electronic test equipment for general purpose and communications needs, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. The Company s primary emphasis is on equipment rentals. At December 31, 2022 the Company was comprised of four reportable business segments: (1) its modular building and portable storage container rental segment Mobile Modular ); (2) its electronic test equipment rental segment TRS-RenTelco ); (3) its containment solutions for the storage of hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids segment Adler Tanks ); and (4) its classroom manufacturing segment selling modular buildings used primarily as classrooms in California Enviroplex ). In 2022, Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco, Adler Tanks and Enviroplex contributed 64 , 25 , 10 and 1 , respectively, of the Company s income before provision for taxes (the equivalent of pre-tax income ), compared to 63 , 28 , 5 and 4 , respectively, for 2021. 
 The Company generates its revenues primarily from the rental of its equipment on operating leases with sales of equipment occurring in the normal course of business. The Company requires significant capital outlay to purchase its rental inventory and recovers its investment through rental and sales revenues. Rental revenue and certain other service revenues negotiated as part of the lease agreements with customers and related costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the lease. Sales revenue and related costs are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to the customers. Sales revenues are less predictable and can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer demands and requirements. Generally, rental revenues less cash operating costs recover the equipment s capitalized cost in a shorter period of time relative to the equipment s potential rental life and when sold, sale proceeds are usually above its net book value. 
 The Company s rental operations include rental and rental related services revenues which comprised approximately 79 of the Company s total revenues in 2022 and for the three years ended December 31, 2022. Over the past three years, modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes comprised approximately 60 , 24 and 16 , respectively, of the cumulative rental operations revenues. The Company s direct costs of rental operations include depreciation of rental equipment, rental related service costs, impairment of rental equipment, and other direct costs of rental operations (which include direct labor, supplies, repairs, insurance, property taxes, license fees and amortization of certain lease costs). 
 The Company sells modular, electronic test equipment and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes that are new, or previously rented. The Company s Enviroplex subsidiary manufactures and sells modular classrooms. The renting and selling of some modular equipment requires a dealer s license, which the Company has obtained from the appropriate governmental agencies. Sales and other revenues of modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes have comprised approximately 21 of the Company s consolidated revenues in 2022 and for the three years ended December 31, 2022. Over the past three years, modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes comprised approximately 79 , 19 and 2 of sales and other revenues, respectively. The Company s cost of sales includes the carrying value of the equipment sold and the direct costs associated with the equipment sold such as delivery, installation, modifications and related site work. 
 The rental and sale of modulars to public school districts comprised 19 , 21 and 23 of the Company s consolidated rental and sales revenues for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. (For more information, see Item 1. Business Relocatable Modular Buildings Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12) above.) 
 Selling and administrative expenses primarily include personnel and benefit costs, which includes share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, bad debt expense, advertising costs, and professional service fees. The Company believes that sharing of common facilities, financing, senior management, and operating and accounting systems by all of the Company s operations, results in an efficient use of overhead. Historically, the Company s operating margins have been impacted favorably to the extent its costs and expenses are leveraged over a large installed customer base. However, there can be no assurance as to the Company s ability to maintain a large installed customer base or ability to sustain its historical operating margins.

Recent Developments 
 Adler Tanks Divestiture and Vesta Modular Acquisition 
 On February 1, 2023, the Company completed an equity sale agreement with Ironclad Environmental Solutions, Inc. Ironclad to sell its Adler Tanks business for a sale price of 265 million, subject to certain adjustments. Concurrently, the Company completed a stock purchase agreement providing for the purchase of Vesta Modular for a purchase price of 400 million, subject to certain adjustments. The divestiture of the Company's Adler Tanks business and the stock purchase of Vesta Modular, represents the Company's strategic shift to concentrate its operations on its core modular and storage businesses. The Company believes that this strategic shift will provide for accelerated growth of the modular business, develop cost and revenue synergies, and increase the proportion of longer-term rental revenue contracts. The details of each transaction are more fully described below. 
 Dividends 
 In February 2023, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 0.465 per common share for the quarter ending March 31, 2023, an increase of 2 over the prior year s comparable quarter. 
 COVID-19 
 The outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, which began in December 2019, has continued to spread globally including to every state in the United States. The Center for Disease Control CDC and World Health Organization WHO recognized this outbreak as a pandemic, which has caused shutdowns to businesses and cities worldwide while disrupting supply chains, business operations, travel, consumer confidence and business sentiment. The Company has taken a number of precautionary health and safety measures to safeguard its employees and customers, while maintaining business continuity. The Company has implemented remote work policies and enhanced cleaning and hygiene protocols in all of its facilities, products and vehicles. The Company is continuing to monitor and assess orders issued by federal, state and local governments to ensure compliance with evolving COVID-19 guidelines. The Company also continues to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on its existing customers who themselves may be impacted by governmental shutdowns and other impacts due to the governmental orders. 
 While the Company has not seen a significant impact from COVID-19 in the financial results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 as set forth in the below sections discussing the results of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company is currently unable to determine or predict the full nature, duration or scope of the overall impact the COVID-19 pandemic and related business and operational pressures will have on its business, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. The Company will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter its business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that the Company determines are in the best interests of employees, customers and shareholders.

Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to 
 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2021 
 Overview 
 Consolidated revenues in 2022 increased to 733.8 million from 616.8 million in 2021. Consolidated net income in 2022 increased to 115.1 million, or 4.70 per diluted share in 2022, compared to 89.7 million, or 3.66 per diluted share, in 2021. The Company s year over year total revenue increase was primarily due to higher rental, sales and rental related services revenues as more fully described below. 
 For 2022 compared to 2021, on a consolidated basis: 
 Gross profit increased 55.9 million, or 20 , to 336.9 million. Mobile Modular s gross profit increased 41.1 million, or 23 , due to higher gross profit on rental, sales and rental related services revenues. TRS-RenTelco s gross profit increased 6.5 million, or 11 , primarily due to higher gross profit on rental and sales revenues. Adler Tanks gross profit increased 13.0 million, or 39 , primarily attributed to higher gross profit on rental and rental related services revenues. Enviroplex s gross profit decreased 4.8 million, or 48 , primarily due to 7.9 million lower sales revenues and lower gross margins of 22.1 compared to 31.8 in 2021. 

Selling and administrative expenses increased 22.7 million, or 15 , to 171.3 million, primarily due to increased headcount and employees salaries and benefit costs totaling 12.1 million and 10.0 million higher marketing and administrative costs. 

Interest expense increased 4.7 million, or 45 , due to 15 higher average debt levels of the Company, accompanied by 26 higher net average interest rates of 3.55 in 2022 compared to 2.81 in 2021. 

Pre-tax income contribution was 64 , 25 and 10 by Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco and Adler Tanks, respectively, in 2022, compared to 63 , 28 and 5 , respectively, in 2021. These results are discussed on a segment basis below. Pre-tax income contribution by Enviroplex was 1 and 4 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 23.2 and 26.3 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The lower rate in 2022 was primarily due to decreased business activity levels in higher tax rate states. 

Adjusted EBITDA increased 40.2 million, or 16 , to 288.9 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment costs, share-based compensation and transaction costs.

Mobile Modular s gross profit for 2022 increased 41.1 million, or 23 , to 217.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021: 
 Gross Profit on Rental Revenues Rental revenues increased 47.7 million, or 22 , due to 15 higher average rental equipment on rent and 5 higher average monthly rental rates in 2022. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 12 and 13 in 2022 and 2021, respectively, and other direct costs were 31 in 2022 and 27 in 2021, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 57 in 2022 compared to 60 in 2021. The higher rental revenues and lower rental margins resulted in gross profit on rental revenues increasing 22.0 million, or 17 , to 154.1 million in 2022. 

Gross Profit on Rental Related Services Rental related services revenues increased 19.5 million, or 27 , compared to 2021. Most of these service revenues are negotiated with the initial lease and are recognized on a straight-line basis with the associated costs over the initial term of the lease. The increase in rental related services revenues was primarily attributable to higher amortization of modular building delivery and return delivery and dismantle revenues and increased delivery and return delivery revenues at Portable Storage. The higher revenues accompanied by higher gross margin percentage of 28 in 2022 compared to 27 in 2021, resulted in rental related services gross profit increasing 6.3 million, or 33 , to 25.6 million in 2022. 

Gross Profit on Sales Sales revenues increased 31.0 million, or 45 , due to higher used and new equipment sales. The higher sales revenues and higher gross margins of 36 in 2022 compared to 34 in 2021, resulted in sales gross profit increasing 12.7 million, or 55 , to 35.9 million in 2022. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of Mobile Modular s rental business; however, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding. 

For 2022, Mobile Modular s selling and administrative expenses increased 17.6 million, or 19 , to 110.2 million, primarily due to 8.2 million higher allocated corporate expenses, increased employee salaries and benefit costs totaling 6.0 million, and 2.8 million higher marketing and administrative costs, compared to 2021. 
 - 34 - 

TRS-RenTelco 
 For 2022, TRS-RenTelco s total revenues increased 10.6 million, or 8 , to 150.8 million compared to 2021, primarily due to higher rental and sales revenues.

TRS-RenTelco s gross profit increased 0.5 million, or 1 , primarily due to higher gross profit on rental revenues. Adler Tanks gross profit decreased 0.4 million, or 1 , due to lower gross profit on rental and rental related services revenues. Enviroplex s gross profit decreased 3.0 million, or 24 , primarily due to 1.7 million lower sales revenues and lower gross margins of 31.8 compared to 39.5 in 2020. 

Selling and administrative expenses increased 25.6 million, or 21 , to 148.6 million, primarily due to increased headcount and employees salaries and benefit costs totaling 12.7 million, primarily from the addition of Design Space and Kitchens To Go employees, and 5.8 million higher amortization of intangible assets from the Design Space and Kitchens To Go acquisitions and 2.0 million of acquisition related transaction costs in 2021. 

Interest expense increased 1.7 million, or 19 , due to 38 higher average debt levels of the Company, partly offset by 14 lower net average interest rates of 2.81 in 2021 compared to 3.25 in 2020. 

Pre-tax income contribution was 63 , 28 and 5 by Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco and Adler Tanks, respectively, in 2021, compared to 62 , 26 and 6 , respectively, in 2020. These results are discussed on a segment basis below. Pre-tax income contribution by Enviroplex was 4 and 6 in 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 26.3 and 22.8 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The higher rate in 2021 was primarily due to increased business activity levels in higher tax rate states. 

Adjusted EBITDA increased 7.6 million, or 3 , to 248.6 million in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment costs, share-based compensation and transaction costs. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities and net income to Adjusted EBITDA can be found on page 46.

Mobile Modular s gross profit for 2021 increased 20.2 million, or 13 , to 176.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020: 
 Gross Profit on Rental Revenues Rental revenues increased 32.0 million, or 17 , due to 11 higher average rental equipment on rent and 6 higher average monthly rental rates. The rental revenue increase was in part due to the new Design Space and Kitchens To Go customers that contributed approximately three quarters of the increase. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 13 and 12 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and other direct costs were 27 in 2021 and 25 in 2020, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 60 in 2021 compared to 63 and 2020. The higher rental revenues and lower rental margins resulted in gross profit on rental revenues increasing 14.1 million, or 12 , to 132.1 million in 2021. 

Gross Profit on Rental Related Services Rental related services revenues increased 4.8 million, or 7 , compared to 2020. Most of these service revenues are negotiated with the initial lease and are recognized on a straight-line basis with the associated costs over the initial term of the lease. The increase in rental related services revenues was primarily attributable to higher amortization of modular building delivery and return delivery and dismantle revenues and increased delivery and return delivery revenues at Portable Storage. The higher revenues offset by lower gross margin percentage of 27 in 2021 compared to 28 in 2020 resulted in rental related services gross profit increasing 0.7 million, or 4 , to 19.3 million in 2021. 

Gross Profit on Sales Sales revenues increased 5.1 million, or 8 , primarily due to higher used equipment sales. The higher sales revenues and higher gross margins of 34 in 2021 compared to 28 in 2020, resulted in sales gross profit increasing 5.4 million, or 30 , to 23.2 million in 2021. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of Mobile Modular s rental business; however, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding. 

For 2021, Mobile Modular s selling and administrative expenses increased 24.1 million, or 35 , to 92.6 million, primarily due to increased employee salaries and benefit costs totaling 7.4 million, primarily due to the addition of Design Space and Kitchens To Go employees, 5.8 million higher amortization of intangible assets due to the Design Space and Kitchens To Go acquisitions, 4.3 million higher allocated corporate expenses and 2.0 million acquisition related costs in 2021.

TRS-RenTelco 
 For 2021, TRS-RenTelco s total revenues decreased 0.6 million to 140.2 million compared to 2020, primarily due to lower sales revenues, partly offset by higher rental revenues. Pre-tax income decreased 0.7 million, or 2 , to 33.8 million for 2021, primarily due to higher selling and administrative expenses.

 To supplement the Company s financial data presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ), the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA , which is defined by the Company as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment costs, share-based compensation and transaction costs. The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure as management believes it provides useful information to investors regarding the Company s liquidity and financial condition and because management, as well as the Company s lenders, use this measure in evaluating the performance of the Company. 
 Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to GAAP measures to further evaluate period-to-period operating performance, compliance with financial covenants in the Company s revolving lines of credit and senior notes and the Company s ability to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements. Management believes the exclusion of non-cash charges, including share-based compensation, and transaction costs is useful in measuring the Company s cash available for operations and performance of the Company. Because management finds Adjusted EBITDA useful, the Company believes its investors will also find Adjusted EBITDA useful in evaluating the Company s performance. 
 Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, cash flows, or other consolidated income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of the Company s profitability or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP and may be different from non GAAP measures used by other companies. Unlike EBITDA, which may be used by other companies or investors, Adjusted EBITDA does not include share-based compensation charges and transaction costs. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is of limited use in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and does not accurately reflect real cash flow. In addition, other companies may not use Adjusted EBITDA or may use other non-GAAP measures, limiting the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of comparison. The Company s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that the Company will not incur expenses that are the same as or similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should only be used to evaluate the Company s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Company compensates for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of the Company s performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined by the SEC, the Company includes in the tables below reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

1. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment costs and share-based compensation. 

2. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenues for the period. 

3. Transaction costs include acquisition and divestiture related legal and professional fees and other costs specific to these transactions. 

Adjusted EBITDA is a component of two restrictive financial covenants for the Company s unsecured Credit Facility, the Note Purchase Agreement, Series D Senior Notes and Series E Senior Notes (as defined and more fully described under the heading Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources ). These instruments contain financial covenants requiring the Company to not: 
 Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility and the Note Purchase Agreement (as defined and more fully described under the heading Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Liquidity and Capital Resources in this MD A)) of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility and the Note Purchase Agreement) to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2022, the actual ratio was 4.27 to 1. 

Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt (as defined in the Credit Facility and the Note Purchase Agreement) to Adjusted EBITDA at any time during any period of four consecutive quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2022, the actual ratio was 1.43 to 1. 

At December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with each of these aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, though, significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company's ability to comply with these covenants.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company s rental businesses are capital intensive and generate significant cash flows. Cash flows for the Company in 2022 as compared to 2021 are summarized as follows: 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities: The Company s operations provided net cash flow of 194.4 million for 2022 as compared to 195.7 million in 2021. The comparable net cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of lower deferred income taxes and increased gain on sale of used rental equipment, partly offset by higher deferred income and other balance sheet changes. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities: Net cash used in investing activities was 131.4 million for 2022 as compared to 351.7 million in 2021. The 220.3 million decrease in net cash used was primarily due to the 285.6 million acquisition of Design Space and Kitchens to Go in 2021, partly offset by 73.5 million higher purchases of rental equipment in 2022. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities: Net cash used in financing activities was 63.5 million in 2022, compared to net cash provided of 156.2 million in 2021. The change in net cash during 2022 was primarily due to reduced borrowings under bank lines of credit and note purchase agreements, as the borrowings in 2021 were the result of funding the Design Space and Kitchens to Go acquisitions, and the 60.0 million principal payment of Series C senior notes in 2022 compared to the 60.0 net borrowings under the note purchase agreement in 2021. 
 Significant capital expenditures are required to maintain and grow the Company s rental assets. During the last three years, the Company has financed its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through cash flows from operations, proceeds from the sale of rental equipment and from borrowings. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of the Company s rental businesses. However, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements and funding. Although the net proceeds received from sales may fluctuate from period to period, the Company believes its liquidity will not be adversely impacted from lower sales in any given year because it believes it has the ability to increase its bank borrowings, offer additional notes and conserve its cash in the future by reducing the amount of cash it uses to purchase rental equipment, pay dividends, or repurchase the Company s common stock. 
 As the following table indicates, cash flow provided by operating activities and proceeds from sales of used rental equipment have been greater than rental equipment purchases over the past three years.

In addition to increasing its rental assets, the Company has periodically made acquisitions of businesses and business assets. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company transacted a total of 292.2 million in acquisition related costs. There were no acquisitions of businesses completed during 2022. The Company had other capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment of 17.6 million in 2022, 2.7 million in 2021 and 13.7 million in 2020, and has used cash to provide returns to its shareholders in the form of cash dividends. The Company paid cash dividends of 44.3 million, 42.2 million and 39.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 The Company has in the past made purchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) transactions, through privately negotiated, large block transactions and through a share repurchase plan, in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In August 2015, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase 2,000,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock (the Repurchase Plan ). The amount and time of the specific repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, including management s discretion. All shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. There can be no assurance that any authorized shares will be repurchased and the repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. There were no shares of common stock repurchased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. As of December 31, 2022, 1,309,805 shares remain authorized for repurchase under the Repurchase Plan.

The Credit Facility provides for a 650.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (which may be further increased to 950.0 million by adding one or more tranches of term loans and/or increasing the aggregate revolving commitments), which includes a 40.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a 20.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. The proceeds of the Credit Facility are available to be used for general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. The Credit Facility permits the Company s existing indebtedness to remain, which includes the Company s 20.0 million Treasury Sweep Note due July 15, 2027, the Company s existing senior notes issued pursuant to the Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement with Prudential Investment Management, Inc., dated as of April 21, 2011 (as amended): (i) the 60.0 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued November 5, 2015 which were repaid on November 5, 2022, (ii) the 40.0 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued March 17, 2021 and due March 17, 2028, and (iii) the 60.0 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued June 16, 2021 and due June 16, 2026. In addition, the Company may incur additional senior note indebtedness in an aggregate amount not to exceed 250.0 million. The Credit Facility matures on July 15, 2027 and replaced the Company s prior 420.0 million credit facility dated March 31, 2020 with Bank of America, N.A., as agent, as amended. All obligations outstanding under the prior credit facility as of the date of the Credit Facility were refinanced by the Credit Facility on July 15, 2022. 
 On August 19, 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated Credit Facility Letter Agreement and a Credit Line Note in favor of MUFG Union Bank, N.A., which provides for a 20.0 million line of credit facility related to its cash management services Sweep Service Facility ). The Sweep Service Facility matures on the earlier of July 15, 2027, or the date the Company ceases to utilize MUFG Union Bank, N.A. for its cash management services. The Sweep Service Facility replaced the Company s prior 12.0 million sweep service facility, dated as of March 30, 2020. 
 At December 31, 2022, under the Credit Facility and Sweep Service Facility, the Company had unsecured lines of credit that permit it to borrow up to 650.0 million of which 313.8 million was outstanding. The Credit Facility contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Amended Credit Facility): 
 Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2022, the actual ratio was 4.27 to 1. 

Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA at any time during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2022, the actual ratio was 1.43 to 1. 

At December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with each of the aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, although significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company s ability to comply with these covenants. 
 Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement 
 On March 31, 2020, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement with PGIM, Inc. PGIM and the holders of Series B and Series C Notes previously issued pursuant to the Prior NPA, among the Company and the other parties to the Note Purchase Agreement.

Shelf Notes may be issued and sold from time to time at the discretion of the Company s Board of Directors and in such amounts as the Board of Directors may determine, subject to prospective purchasers agreement to purchase the Shelf Notes. The Company will sell the Shelf Notes directly to such purchasers. The full net proceeds of each Shelf Note will be used in the manner described in the applicable Request for Purchase with respect to such Shelf Note. 
 2.57 Senior Notes Due in 2028 
 - 49 - 

On March 17, 2021, the Company issued and sold to the purchasers 40 million aggregate principal amount of 2.57 Series D Notes (the Series D Senior Notes pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement, dated March 31, 2020 (the Note Purchase Agreement ), among the Company, PGIM, Inc. and the noteholders party thereto.

 2.35 Senior Notes Due in 2026 
 On June 16, 2021, the Company issued and sold to the purchasers 60 million aggregate principal amount of 2.35 Series E Notes (the Series E Notes pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement, dated March 31, 2020 (the Note Purchase Agreement ), among the Company, PGIM, Inc. and the noteholders party thereto.

 Among other restrictions, the Note Purchase Agreement, which has superseded in its entirety the Prior NPA, under which the Series C Senior Notes, Series D Senior Notes and Series E Senior Notes were sold, contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Note Purchase Agreement): 
 Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2022, the actual ratio was 4.27 to 1.

At December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with each of the aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, although significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company s ability to comply with these covenants. 
 Although no assurance can be given, the Company believes it will continue to be able to negotiate general bank lines of credit and issue senior notes adequate to meet capital requirements not otherwise met by operational cash flows and proceeds from sales of rental equipment. Furthermore, the Company believes it has the financial resources to weather any short-term impacts of COVID-19. However, the Company has limited insight into the extent to which its business may be impacted by COVID-19, and there are many uncertainties, including how long and how severely the Company will be impacted. An extended and severe impact may materially and adversely affect the Company s future operations, financial position and liquidity. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company s material contractual obligations and commitments consisted of outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities expiring in 2027, outstanding amounts under our 2.35 and 2.57 senior notes due in 2026 and 2028, respectively, and operating leases for facilities.

The Company believes that its needs for working capital and capital expenditures through 2023 and beyond will be adequately met by operating cash flow, proceeds from the sale of rental equipment, and bank borrowings. 
 Please see the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on page 62 for a more detailed presentation of the sources and uses of the Company's cash. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. A summary of the Company s significant accounting policies are in Note 1 to the Company s consolidated financial statements. The Company determined its critical accounting policies by considering those policies that involve the most complex or subjective assumptions, estimates, and/or judgement. Material changes in these assumptions, estimates or judgments could have the potential to have a material impact on the Company s financial results. The Company has identified below the accounting policies that it believes could potentially have a material impact on operating results if a change in assumption, estimate and/or judgment were to occur. 
 Depreciation - The estimated useful lives and estimated residual values used for rental equipment are based on the Company s experience as to the economic useful life and sale value of its products. Additionally, to the extent information is publicly available, the Company also compares its depreciation policies to other companies with similar rental products for reasonableness. 
 The lives and residual values of rental equipment are subject to periodic evaluation. For modular equipment, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, changes in legislation, regulations, building codes, local permitting, and supply or demand. Internal factors for modulars may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications, condition of equipment, or maintenance policies. For electronic test equipment, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, technological advances, changes in manufacturers selling prices, and supply or demand. Internal factors for electronic test equipment may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications, condition of equipment, or maintenance policies. For liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, changes in Federal and State legislation, the types of materials stored and the frequency of movements and uses. Internal factors for liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications and maintenance policies. 
 To the extent that the useful lives of all of our rental equipment were to decrease or increase by one year, the Company estimates the annual depreciation expense would increase or decrease by approximately 6 million. If the estimated residual values of all of our rental equipment were to change one percentage point, the Company estimates the annual depreciation expense would change by approximately 1 million. Any changes in depreciation expense as a result of a change in useful lives or residual values would result in a proportional increase or decrease in the gross profit the Company would recognize upon the ultimate sale of the equipment. 
 Maintenance, repair and refurbishment - Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The direct material and labor costs of value-added additions or major refurbishment of modular buildings are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly improves the quality and adds value or life to the equipment. Judgment is involved as to when these costs should be capitalized. The Company s policies narrowly limit the capitalization of value-added items to specific additions such as portable storage office conversions, restrooms, sidewalls and ventilation upgrades. In addition, only major refurbishment costs incurred near the end of the estimated useful life of the rental equipment, which extend its useful life, and are subject to certain limitations, are capitalized. The Company capitalized 9 million in extended life or value added refurbishments in 2022. Changes in these policies to expense these costs as incurred could impact the Company s financial results. 
 
 Acquisition Accounting - The Company has made acquisitions of businesses in the past and records the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. Long-lived assets (primarily rental equipment), goodwill and other intangible assets generally represent the largest components of the Company s acquisitions. Determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired can be judgmental in nature and can involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Rental equipment is valued utilizing either a cost, market or income approach, or a combination of certain of these methods, depending on the asset being valued and the availability of market or income data. The intangible assets acquired are primarily comprised of customer relationships, non-compete agreements and trade names. These assets are valued on an excess earnings or income approach based on projected cash flows. The estimated fair values of these intangible assets reflect various assumptions about revenue growth rates, operating margins, projected cash flows, discount rates, customer attrition rates, terminal values, useful lives and other prospective financial information. When appropriate, the Company s estimates of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired include assistance from independent third-party valuation firms. Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired business over the net of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired, as well as the estimated life of the assets, can materially impact the Company s financial results in periods subsequent

to the acquisition through depreciation and amortization, and in certain instances through impairment charges, if the asset becomes impaired in the future. As discussed below, we regularly review for impairments. 
 Impairment of rental equipment - The carrying value of the Company s rental equipment is its capitalized cost less accumulated depreciation. To the extent events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value cannot be recovered, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value to fair value. The Company evaluates the carrying value of rental equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances have occurred that would indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Determining fair value includes estimates and judgments regarding the projected net cash flows considering current and future market conditions including assumptions regarding utilization, rental pricing, the condition of the equipment, the equipment s expected remaining life and sale proceeds. Due to uncertainties inherent in the valuation process and market conditions, it is reasonably possible that actual results of operating and disposing of rental equipment could be materially different than current expectations. 
 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets - The Company s goodwill is not amortized to expense, the Company assesses whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments. These impairment assessments occur annually, or more frequently if an event occurs, or circumstances change in the interim that would indicate that it was more likely than not the fair value had reduced below its carrying value. Application of the goodwill impairment assessment requires judgement including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, business projections including changes in pricing, rental and sale activity and costs, long term growth rates and discount rates. In 2022, 2021 and 2020 the Company performed qualitative assessments taking into consideration the market value of the Company, any changes in management, key personnel, strategy and any relevant macroeconomic conditions, concluding that the fair value of the reporting units substantially exceeded the respective reporting units carrying value, including goodwill. 
 Intangible assets (other than goodwill) acquired are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Definite lived intangibles are amortized over their expected useful lives, while indefinite lived intangibles are not amortized. The Company monitors conditions related to these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization period. The Company tests these assets for potential impairment annually and whenever management determines events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
 Revenue recognition: 
 Lease revenue - Rental revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all operating segments. Rental billings for periods extending beyond period end are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in the period earned. Rental related services revenues are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes leases. For modular building leases, rental related services revenues for modifications, delivery, installation, dismantle and return delivery are lease related because the payments are considered minimum lease payments that are an integral part of the negotiated lease agreement with the customer. These revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenues include interest income on sales-type leases and rental income on facility leases. 
 Non-lease revenue - Sales revenue is recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to customers. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. The Company typically recognizes non-lease related revenues at a point in time because the customer does not simultaneously consume the benefits of the Company s promised goods and services, or performance obligations, and obtain control when delivery and installation are complete. For contracts that have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract based on the Company s best estimate of the standalone selling prices of each distinct performance obligation in the contract. The standalone selling price is typically determined based upon the expected cost plus an estimated margin of each performance obligation. Judgment is involved in determining the performance obligations and standalone selling prices. To the extent actual results were to differ from these estimates, the timing of profit recognition could change and impact the Company s financial results. 
 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 The Company is exposed to cash flow and fair value risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to its 2.35 and 2.57 senior notes due in 2026 and 2028, respectively, and its revolving lines of credit. Weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at December 31, 2022. The estimate of fair value of the Company s fixed rate debt is based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities. The table below presents principal cash flows by expected annual maturities, related weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value for the Company s

The Company formed a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, TRS-RenTelco Inc., in 2004 in conjunction with the TRS acquisition and a wholly owned Indian subsidiary, TRS-RenTelco India Private Limited, in 2013. The Company commenced the closure of its Indian operations during 2017. The Canadian operations of the Company subject it to foreign currency risks (i.e. the possibility that the financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates). Currently, the Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge its economic exposure with respect to assets, liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In 2022, the Company experienced minimal impact on net income due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Although there can be no assurances, given the size of the Canadian operations, the Company does not expect future foreign exchange gains and losses to be significant. 
 The Company has no derivative financial instruments that expose the Company to significant market risk.

Management s Report on Internal C ontrol over Financial Reporting 
 The Company s management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K. The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts based on management s estimates and judgments. All other financial information in this report has been presented on a basis consistent with the information included in the financial statements. 
 The Company s management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company maintains a system of internal control that is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliable preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition. 
 The Company s system of internal control over financial reporting is embodied in the Company s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. It sets the tone of our organization and includes factors such as integrity and ethical values. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by formal policies and procedures, which are reviewed, modified and improved as changes occur in business conditions and operations. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. 
 The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of outside directors, meets periodically with members of management and the independent auditors to review and discuss internal control over financial reporting, as well as accounting and financial reporting matters. The independent auditors report to the Audit Committee and accordingly have full and free access to the Audit Committee at any time. 
 The Company s management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the criteria set forth in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

Property, plant and equipment depreciation expense was million, million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Construction in progress at December 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted primarily of costs related to acquisition of land, land improvements and information technology upgrades. 
 million and million in internal use software during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 million, million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. 
 
 million and million, respectively. The Company assesses potential impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets when there is evidence that events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate the recovery of an asset s carrying value is unlikely. The Company also assesses potential impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis regardless of whether there is evidence of impairment. If indicators of impairment were to be present in intangible assets used in operations and future discounted cash flows were not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount, an impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified. The amount of an impairment loss would be recognized as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value. Factors the Company considers important, which may cause impairment include, among others, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset, negative industry or economic trends, and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results. The impairment review of the Company s goodwill is performed by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine if the goodwill is impaired. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, then goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit were to exceed its fair value, then a goodwill impairment loss is recorded for the amount the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. The Company conducted its annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2022. The impairment analysis did t result in an impairment charge for the fiscal year ended 2022. There were impairment charges in 2021 or 2020. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The Company based its fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes are reasonable but are uncertain and subject to changes in market conditions. 

Effect of potentially dilutive securities from equity-based compensation 

Weighted-average common stock for calculating diluted earnings per share 

In 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were shares having an anti-dilutive effect requiring exclusion from the computation of diluted earnings per share. 
 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock (the Repurchase Plan ). The amount and time of the specific repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, including management s discretion. All shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. There can be no assurance that any authorized shares will be repurchased and the Repurchase Plan may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were shares of common stock repurchased. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased shares of its common stock for an average purchase price of per share or an aggregate price of million. As of December 31, 2022, shares remain authorized for repurchase. million at December 31, 2022 and million at December 31, 2021. The Company sells primarily on -day terms, individually performs credit evaluation procedures on its customers on each transaction and will require security deposits from its customers when a significant credit risk is identified. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts in amounts equal to the estimated losses expected to be incurred in the collection of the accounts receivable. The estimated losses are based on historical collection experience in conjunction with an evaluation of the current status of the existing accounts. Customer accounts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when an account is determined to be uncollectable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the Company s assessment of the collectability of customer accounts receivable from operating lease and non-lease revenues. The Company regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as historical payment experience and trends, the age of the accounts receivable balances, the Company s operating segment, customer industry, credit quality and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay. The Company recognized bad debt expense of million, million and million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The allowance for doubtful accounts was million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and million for the years ended 2021 and 2020.

day payment terms. The Company does not typically offer variable payment terms, or accept non-monetary consideration. Amounts billed and due from the Company s customers are classified as Accounts receivable on the Company s consolidated balance sheet. For certain sales of modular buildings, progress payments from the customer are received during the manufacturing of new equipment, or the preparation of used equipment. The advance payments are not considered a significant financing component because the payments are used to meet working capital needs during the contract and to protect the Company from the customer failing to adequately complete their obligations under the contract. These contract liabilities are included in Deferred income on the Company s consolidated balance sheets and totaled million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sales revenues totaling million were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022, which were included in the contract liability balance at December 31, 2021. For certain modular building sales, the customer retains a small portion of the contract price until full completion of the contract, which results in revenue earned in excess of billings. These unbilled contract assets are included in Accounts receivable on the Company s consolidated balance sheets and totaled million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Lease Revenues Rental revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all operating segments. Rental billings for periods extending beyond period end are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in the period earned. Rental related services revenues are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes leases. For modular building leases, rental related services revenues for modifications, delivery, installation, dismantle and return delivery are lease related because the payments are considered minimum lease payments that are an integral part of the negotiated lease agreement with the customer. These revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenues include interest income on sales-type leases and rental income on facility leases. Non-Lease Revenues Non-lease revenues are recognized in the period when control of the performance obligation is transferred, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. For liquid and solid containment solutions, portable storage containers and electronic test equipment, rental related services revenues for delivery and return delivery are considered non-lease revenues. Sales revenues are typically recognized at a point in time, which occurs upon the completion of delivery, installation and acceptance of the equipment by the customer. Accounting for non-lease revenues requires judgment in determining the point in time the customer gains control of the equipment and the appropriate accounting period to recognize revenue. Sales taxes charged to customers are reported on a net basis and are excluded from revenues and expenses.

Customer returns of rental equipment prior to the end of the rental contract term are typically billed a cancellation fee, which is recorded as rental revenue in the period billed. Sales of new relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment and related accessories and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes not manufactured by the Company are typically covered by warranties provided by the manufacturer of the products sold. The Company typically provides limited -day warranties for certain sales of used rental equipment and warranties on equipment manufactured by Enviroplex. Although the Company s policy is to provide reserves for warranties when required for specific circumstances, the Company has not found it necessary to establish such reserves to date as warranty costs have not been significant. The Company s incremental cost of obtaining lease contracts, which consists of salesperson commissions, are deferred and amortized over the initial lease term for modular building leases. Incremental costs for obtaining a contract for all other operating segments are expensed in the period incurred because the lease term is typically less than 12 months.

In December 2016, the Company decided to exit the Bangalore, India branch operations of its TRS-RenTelco electronics division. The wind down of operations in India began in 2017. As a result, a valuation allowance was recorded against the deferred tax assets that resulted primarily from accumulated net operating loss carry forwards in India that management estimated the benefit of which will not be realized. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s foreign net operating losses for tax purposes were million. If not realized, these carry forwards will begin to expire in . For income tax purposes, deductible compensation related to share-based awards is based on the value of the award when realized, which may be different than the compensation expense recognized by the company for financial statement purposes which is based on the award value on the date of grant. The difference between the value of the award upon grant, and the value of the award when ultimately realized, creates either additional tax expense or benefit. In 2022, 2021 and 2020 exercise of share-based awards by employees resulted in an excess tax benefit of million, million and million, respectively. percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.

The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require the application of significant judgment. Our income tax returns are subject to examination by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. There may be differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2018. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision (benefit) for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented. Such interest and penalties were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

Application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of share-based compensation amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. options were granted in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

Facility rent expense was million in 2022, million in 2021 and million in 2020. The Company is involved in various lawsuits and routine claims arising out of the normal course of its business. The Company maintains insurance coverage for its operations and employees with appropriate aggregate, per occurrence and deductible limits as the Company reasonably determines necessary or prudent with current operations and historical experience. The major policies include coverage for property, general liability, auto, directors and officers, health, and workers compensation insurances. The Company records a provision for a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. The Company reviews these provisions at least quarterly and adjusts these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company s control. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility that the ultimate amount of liability not covered by insurance, if any, under any pending litigation and claims, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the financial position or operating results of the Company. The Company s health plans are self-funded high deductible plans with annual stop-loss insurance of per claim. Beginning in 2019, the Company s workers compensation insurance is underwritten by an insurance company with no stop-loss value and for prior claim years. Insurance providers are responsible for making claim payments that exceed these amounts on an individual claim basis. In addition, the Company has stop loss insurance that pays for claim payments made during a twelve month coverage period that exceeds certain specified thresholds in the aggregate. The Company records an expense when health and workers compensation claim payments are made and accrues for the portion of claims incurred, but not yet paid at period end. The Company makes these accruals based upon a combination of historical claim payments, loss development experience and actuarial estimates. A high degree of judgment is required in developing the underlying assumptions and the resulting amounts to be accrued. In addition, our assumptions will change as the Company s loss experience develops. All of these factors have the potential for impacting the amounts previously accrued and the Company may be required to increase or decrease the amounts previously accrued. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, accruals for the Company s health and workers compensation high deductible plans were million and million, respectively.
