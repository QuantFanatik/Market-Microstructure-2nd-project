The words anticipates, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, possible, potential, predict, project, should, would and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements in this report may include, for example, statements about our: ability to complete our initial business combination; success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or directors following our initial business combination; officers and directors allocating their time to other businesses and potentially having conflicts of interest with our business or in approving our initial business combination, as a result of which they would then receive expense reimbursements; potential ability to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination; pool of prospective target businesses; the ability of our officers and directors to generate a number of potential investment opportunities; potential change in control if we acquire one or more target businesses for stock; the potential liquidity and trading of our securities; the lack of a market for our securities; use of proceeds not held in the trust account or available to us from interest income on the trust account balance; or financial performance following our initial public offering. 
 The forward-looking statements contained in this report are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described under the heading Risk Factors. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws and/or if and when management knows or has a reasonable basis on which to conclude that previously disclosed projections are no longer reasonably attainable.

 In connection with the business combination, we have filed certain relevant materials with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Promptly after filing our definitive proxy statement with the SEC, we will mail the definitive proxy statement and a proxy card to each shareholder entitled to vote at the extraordinary general meeting relating to the business combination. INVESTORS AND SECURITY HOLDERS OF THE COMPANY ARE URGED TO READ THESE MATERIALS (INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE BUSINESS COMBINATION THAT THE COMPANY WILL FILE WITH THE SEC WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY, BITDEER AND THE MERGERS.

Extensions and Redemptions On December 5, 2022, the Company held an Extraordinary General Meeting. At this meeting, the shareholders of the Company approved the proposal to amend and restate (the Charter Amendment the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the Charter to, among other things, extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a Business Combination (the Extension up to four (4) times for an additional three months each time from December 14, 2022 to December 14, 2023 Extended Termination Date (the Amended Charter ). Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Charter, the Company has until 18 months from the closing of the IPO to consummate a Business Combination, provided however that the Company may, by resolution of directors, at the request of the initial shareholders, extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination up to four times, each time by an additional three months (for a total of up to 30 months to complete a Business Combination), subject to the initial shareholders depositing additional funds into the Trust Account for each three-month extension in accordance with terms as set out in the Trust Agreement. In the event that the Company does not consummate a Business Combination within up to 30 months from the closing of the IPO (subject to valid three months extensions having been made in each case), such failure shall trigger an automatic redemption of the Public Shares (an Automatic Redemption Event) and the Directors of the Company shall take all such action necessary (i) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten (10) Business Days thereafter to redeem the Public Shares in cash at a per-share amount equal to the applicable Per-Share Redemption Price; and (ii) as promptly as practicable, to cease all operations except for the purpose of making such distribution and any subsequent winding up of the Company s affairs. In the event of an Automatic Redemption Event, only the holders of Public Shares shall be entitled to receive pro rata redeeming distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Public Shares. In connection with the vote to approve the Charter Amendment, the Company paid approximately 41.99 million out of the Trust Account to redeem 4,031,612 Class A ordinary shares at a redemption price of approximately 10.41 per share. On June 1, 2022 and September 6, 2022, using the loan amount received to date, the Company deposited into the Company s Trust Account 1,150,000 (representing 0.20 per Class A ordinary share) to extend the Combination Period from June 14, 2022 to December 14, 2022. On December 5, 2022, the Company made a deposit of 257,758.20 (representing 0.15 per Class A ordinary share) to the Trust Account and extended the Combination Period from December 14, 2022 to March 14, 2023. Competitive Strengths If the transaction with Bitdeer does not close, we believe that our management team is well positioned to identify and implement other attractive business combination opportunities in an efficient manner. Through our management team s network, we intend to execute a business combination and ultimately create returns for our shareholders through organic growth and/or follow-on acquisitions. Our management team is led by Alex Yamashita. We believe the experience and contacts of our management team will give us distinct advantages in sourcing, structuring and consummating acquisition transactions. Mr. Alan Yamashita, our Chairman, has over 40 years of experience in the financial and equity investment industry having most recently been a managing partner at Polar Ventures, a private investment firm that provides capital and strategic solutions to companies in sectors important to the Asia region s development. Mr. Alan Yamashita was previously executive advisor to Mizuho Alternative Investments LLC, president and chief executive officer of Search Investment Group, and founding chief executive officer and chief investment officer of Search Alternative Investment Limited, a major private global hedge fund and private equity investment practice with a multi-billion dollar portfolio.

Mr. Mark Streeter, our Independent Director is a Director of Cultur3 Capital, an Approved Investment Manager, and has over a decade of experience in institutional capital markets and consulting in fintech and blockchain sectors.

Our management team s past performance is not an assurance that we will be able to identify an appropriate candidate for our initial business combination or achieve success with respect to the business combination we intend to consummate. However, we believe that the skills and professional network of our management team will enable us to identify, structure and consummate a business combination. Our management team s past performance is not an assurance that we will be able to identify an appropriate candidate for our initial business combination or achieve success with respect to the business combination we intend to consummate. However, we believe that the skills and professional network of our management team will enable us to identify, structure and consummate a business combination. Effecting an Acquisition Transaction If the transaction with Bitdeer does not close, our acquisition strategy will be to capitalize on the strengths of our management team to allow us to identify businesses that have the capacity for cash flow creation, opportunity for operational improvement, robust company fundamentals, and qualified and driven management teams. Our deal sourcing process will leverage our management team s industry experiences proven deal sourcing capabilities and broad network of relationships in numerous industries, including business executives, entrepreneurs, media relationships, institutional investors, family offices, investment bankers and attorneys. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest noncore assets or divisions. We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, or completing the business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent accounting firm or independent investment banking firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. The COVID-19 coronavirus has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected the economies and financial markets worldwide, and potential target companies may defer or end discussions for a potential business combination with us whether or not COVID-19 affects their business operations. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search for a business combination will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. We may be unable to complete a business combination if continued concerns relating to COVID-19 restrict travel, limiting our ability to conduct meetings to negotiate and consummate transactions in a timely manner with potential investors, target company s personnel, or vendors and services providers.

 Shareholders may not have the ability to approve our initial business combination Although we may seek shareholder approval before we effect our initial business combination, we may not do so for business or legal reasons (so long as such transaction does not require shareholder approval under the BVI Business Companies Act or the rules of Nasdaq). Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether we expect shareholder approval would be required under the BVI Business Companies Act for each such transaction. 

Type of Transaction Whether Shareholder Approval is Required Purchase of assets No Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company No Merger of target with a subsidiary of the company No Merger of the company with a target Yes Entering into contractual agreements with a target to obtain control No Additionally, under Nasdaq s listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example: we issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20 of the number of ordinary shares then outstanding (other than in a public offering); any of our directors, officers or substantial shareholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5 or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10 or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 5 or more; or the issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control. We also may be required to obtain shareholder approval if we wish to take certain actions in connection with our initial business combination such as amending our memorandum and articles of association. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing of our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with such rules. Redemption rights for public shareholders upon consummation of our initial business combination We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion their shares upon the consummation of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their right to receive liquidating distributions if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the Combination Period. However, if our initial shareholders or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after the IPO, they will be entitled to receive liquidating distributions with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the Combination Period. Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no initial business combination Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Charter, the Company has until 18 months from the closing of the IPO to consummate a Business Combination, provided however that the Company may, by resolution of directors, at the request of the initial shareholders, extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination up to four times, each time by an additional three months (for a total of up to 30 months to complete a Business Combination), subject to the initial shareholders depositing additional funds into the Trust Account for each three-month extension in accordance with terms as set out in the Trust Agreement. In the event that the Company does not consummate a Business Combination within up to 30 months from the closing of the IPO (subject to valid three months extensions having been made in each case), such failure shall trigger an automatic redemption of the Public Shares (an Automatic Redemption Event) and the Directors of the Company shall take all such action necessary (i) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than

 ten (10) Business Days thereafter to redeem the Public Shares in cash at a per-share amount equal to the applicable Per-Share Redemption Price; and (ii) as promptly as practicable, to cease all operations except for the purpose of making such distribution and any subsequent winding up of the Company s affairs. In the event of an Automatic Redemption Event, only the holders of Public Shares shall be entitled to receive pro rata redeeming distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Public Shares. Competition In identifying, evaluating and selecting an alternate target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources. The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses: our obligation to seek shareholder approval of a business combination or obtain the necessary financial information to be sent to shareholders in connection with such business combination may delay or prevent the completion of a transaction; the fact that there are fewer than ten months left in the Combination Period; our obligation to convert public shares held by our public shareholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination; Nasdaq may require us to file a new listing application and meet its initial listing requirements to maintain the listing of our securities following a business combination; our outstanding Rights and unit purchase options and the potential future dilution they represent; our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions to Maxim Group LLC upon consummation of our initial business combination; our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the private units (and underlying securities) and any securities issued to our initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans; and the impact on the target business assets as a result of unknown liabilities under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us prior to the consummation of a business combination. 
 Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms. If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively. Employees We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Incorporated by reference to the Risk Factors section to the Prospectus filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on June 10, 2021. Our independent registered public accounting firm s report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 487,303 in cash, and working capital deficit of 6,602,257. Further, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs as a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as expenses in connection with our proposed initial business combination with Bitdeer. Management s plans to address any need for additional capital are discussed in Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We cannot assure you that any efforts to raise capital (if required) or to consummate an initial business combination (including the current proposed initial business combination with Bitdeer) will be successful. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statement contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K do not include any adjustments that might result from our inability to continue as a going concern. Material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could have a significant adverse effect on our business and the price of our ordinary shares. We have identified material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. In future periods, if additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are identified, we may be required to restate our financial statements and could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, a loss of public and investor confidence, and to litigation from investors and shareholders, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and the price of our Class A ordinary shares. In addition, if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, we may not be able to manage our business effectively or accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause a decline in our ordinary share price and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, Nasdaq or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources. If we were considered to be a foreign person, we might not be able to complete an initial business combination with a U.S. target company if such initial business combination is subject to U.S. foreign investment regulations or review by a U.S. government entity, such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States CFIUS ). Our Sponsor is controlled by or has substantial ties with non-U.S. persons domiciled outside the U.S. Acquisitions and investments by non-U.S. persons in certain U.S. businesses may be subject to rules or regulations that limit foreign ownership. CFIUS is an interagency committee authorized to review certain transactions involving investments by foreign persons in U.S. businesses that have a nexus to critical technologies, critical infrastructure and/or sensitive personal data in order to determine the effect of such transactions on the national security of the U.S. Were we considered to be a foreign person under such rules and regulations, any proposed business combination between us and a U.S. business engaged in a regulated industry or which may affect national security could be subject to such foreign ownership restrictions, CFIUS review and/or mandatory filings. If our potential initial business combination with a U.S. business falls within the scope of foreign ownership restrictions, we may not be able to consummate an initial business combination with such business. In addition, if our potential business combination falls within CFIUS s jurisdiction, we may be required to make a mandatory filing or determine to submit a voluntary notice to CFIUS, or to proceed with the initial business combination without notifying CFIUS and risk CFIUS intervention, before or after closing the initial business combination. CFIUS may decide to block or delay our initial business combination, impose conditions to mitigate national security concerns with respect to such initial business combination or order us to divest all or a portion of a U.S. business of the combined company if we had proceeded without first obtaining CFIUS clearance. The potential limitations and risks may limit the attractiveness of a transaction with us or prevent us from pursuing certain initial business combination opportunities that we believe would otherwise be beneficial to us and our shareholders. As a result, the pool of potential targets with which we could complete an initial business combination may be limited and we may be adversely affected in terms of competing with other special purpose acquisition companies which do not have similar foreign ownership issues.

 Moreover, the process of government review, whether by CFIUS or otherwise, could be lengthy. Because we have only a limited time to complete our initial business combination, our failure to obtain any required approvals within the requisite time-period may require us to liquidate. If we liquidate, our public shareholders may only receive their pro rata share of amounts held in the Trust Account, and our rights will expire worthless. This will also cause you to lose any potential investment opportunity in a target company and the chance of realizing future gains on your investment through any price appreciation in the combined company. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES We do not own any real estate or other physical properties materially important to our operations. We maintain our principal executive offices at The Sun s Group Center, 29th Floor, 200 Gloucester Road, Wan Chai, Hong Kong. Our Sponsor is providing us this 10,000 a month. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We may be subject to legal proceedings, investigations and claims incidental to the conduct of our business from time to time. We are not currently a party to any material litigation or other legal proceedings brought against us. We are also not aware of any legal proceeding, investigation or claim, or other legal exposure that has a more than remote possibility of having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not Applicable.

Such initial purchasers were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the Private Units. The Private Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering. A total of 58,075,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement were deposited in a Trust Account established for the benefit of the Company s public shareholders at JPMorgan Chase Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, acting as trustee. None of the funds held in trust will be released from the Trust Account, other than interest income to pay any tax obligations, until the earlier of (i) the consummation of the Company s initial business combination and (ii) the Company s failure to consummate a business combination before December 14, 2023 (if extended to the fullest extent permitted).

Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview We are a blank check company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands as a business company and incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the private placement of the private placement units, the proceeds of the sale of our securities in connection with our initial business combination. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a business combination will be successful. Recent Developments On November 18, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Original Merger Agreement dated November 18, 2021 with Blue Safari Mini Corp., an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company Merger Sub ), and Bitdeer Technologies Holding Company, an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands Bitdeer ).

 a business combination in accordance with our organizational documents (the Combination Period and for our working capital. Such loans will only become repayable upon the Closing of the Business Combination. On December 2, 2022, the parties entered into a Second Amendment to Merger Agreement (the Second Amendment , and the Amended Merger Agreement as amended by such Second Amendment, the Second Amended Merger Agreement to extend the termination date upon which either the Company or Bitdeer may terminate the Second Amended Merger Agreement, from September 1, 2022 to the earlier of (i) June 1, 2023 and (ii) the then last day of the Combination Period.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company received such interest-free loan from Bitdeer in the aggregate principal amount of 2,545,800. On June 1, 2022 and September 6, 2022, using the loan amount received to date, the Company deposited into the Company s Trust Account 1,150,000 (representing 0.20 per Class A ordinary share) to extend the Combination Period from June 14, 2022 to December 14, 2022. On December 5, 2022, the Company made a deposit of 257,758 (representing 0.15 per Class A ordinary share) to the Trust Account and extended the Combination Period from December 14, 2022 to March 14, 2023. Results of Operations We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenues to date. Our only activities from inception through December 31, 2022 were organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, and, following our initial public offering, searching for a Business Combination target and the negotiation of the Merger Agreement as described above. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial business combination. We expect to generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held after the Initial Public Offering. We expect that we will incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with searching for, and completing, a Business Combination. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had net loss of 3,917,800, which consists of operating costs and business combination costs of 4,660,233, offset by interest income from investments in our Trust Account of 742,433.

The Units were sold at an offering price of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 50,000,000. We granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 750,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments which the underwriters exercised in full simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO. The total aggregate issuance by us of 5,750,000 units at a price of 10.00 per Unit resulted in a total gross proceeds of 57,500,000. As of June 14, 2021, a total of 58,075,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement (as defined below) were deposited in a Trust Account established for the benefit of the Company s public shareholders. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement Private Placement with BSG First Euro Investment Corp., the Company s Sponsor, of 292,500 units (the Private Units at a price of 10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of 2,925,000. The Private Units are identical to the Units sold in the IPO. Additionally, such initial purchasers agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the Registration Statement) until 30 days after the completion of the Company s initial business combination. Such initial purchasers were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the Private Units. The Private Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering. Following the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Units, a total of 58,075,000 was placed in the Trust Account, and the Company had 884,500 of cash held outside of the Trust Account, after payment of costs related to the Initial Public Offering,

 and available for working capital purposes. The Company incurred 4,158,799 in transaction costs, including 1,150,000 of underwriting fees, 2,012,500 of deferred underwriting fees, the fair value of the representative shares of 478,857, and 517,442 of other offering costs. For the year ended December 31, 2022, there was 1,064,156 of cash used in operating activities. Net loss of 3,917,800 was affected by interest earned on cash and marketable securities held in Trust Account amounting to 742,433 and offset by changes in current assets and liabilities of 3,596,077. For the period from February 23, 2021 (Inception) to December 31, 2021, there was 398,627 of cash used in operating activities. Net loss of 1,239,720 was affected by formation costs paid by Sponsor of 7,169, changes in current assets and liabilities of 836,028 and offset by interest earned on cash and marketable securities held in Trust Account amounting to 2,104. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 487,303 of cash on hand and working capital deficit of 6,602,257. The Company expect to incur increased expenses since becoming a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as expenses in connection with the initial business combination. On June 1, 2022 and September 6, 2022, using the loan amount received to date, the Company deposited into the Company s Trust Account 1,150,000 (representing 0.20 per Class A ordinary share) to extend the Combination Period from June 14, 2022 to December 14, 2022. On December 5, 2022, the Company made a deposit of 257,758 (representing 0.15 per Class A ordinary share) to the Trust Account and extended the date by which the Company has to complete a business combination from December 14, 2022 to March 14, 2023. It is uncertain that the Company will be able consummate a business combination by this date. If a business combination is not consummated within the Combination Period, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with the authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern , management has determined that mandatory liquidation, and subsequent dissolution, should the Company be unable to complete a business combination, raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. If a business combination is not consummated by this date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after March 14, 2023. Based upon the above analysis, management determined that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2022. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non- financial assets. Contractual Obligations We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities other than an agreement to pay our Sponsor a monthly fee of 10,000 for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. We began incurring these fees on June 14, 2021 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the business combination or our liquidation. The underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of 3.5 of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, or 2,012,500. The deferred fee will be payable in cash to the underwriters solely in the event that we complete a business combination from the amounts held in the Trust Account, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.

 Pursuant to the Second Amendment, Bitdeer will provide certain interest-free loans with an aggregate principal amount of US 2,584,141 to us to fund any amount that may be required in order to extend the period of time available for us to consummate a business combination and for our working capital. Such loans will only become repayable upon the Closing of the Business Combination. As of December 31, 2022, we received 2,545,800 under such loan. On March 1, 2021, the Company issued the Promissory Note to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of 200,000. The Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable on the date that the Company consummates the IPO of its securities or the date on which the Company determines not to conduct an IPO, however, the date was extended to August 31, 2022, provided that the Company may in its sole discretion, and upon written notice to the Sponsor, extend such maturity date for an additional six months in the event that the Company has not repaid in full the principal amount and accrued interest by August 31, 2022 pursuant to the amended Promissory Note issued on May 30, 2022. On August 31, 2022, the Company issued an extension notice to the Sponsor, to extend the maturity date of the Promissory Note for an additional six (6) months from August 31, 2022 to February 28, 2023. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had borrowed 200,000 under the promissory note. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: Class A Common Stock Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption We account for our Class A Common Stock Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Class A Common Stock Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption is classified as a liability instrument and measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Class A Common Stock Ordinary Shares (including Class A Common Stock Ordinary Shares that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Class A Common Stock Ordinary Shares is classified as shareholders equity. Our Class A Common Stock Ordinary Shares features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, all Class A Common Stock Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders equity section of our balance sheet. Net Income per Common Share The Company accounts for its Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company s control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders equity. The Company s Class A ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company s control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. ITEM 7A.

 ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our current chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our Certifying Officers ), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022, pursuant to Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022 due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to complex financial instruments. In light of this material weakness, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our audited financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly in all material respects our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the period presented. Management s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting As required by SEC rules and regulations implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 1. pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our company, 2. provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and 3. provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2022. In making these assessments, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. Management has implemented steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting. To respond to the material weakness related to complex financial instruments, we have devoted, and plan to continue to devote, significant effort and resources to the remediation and improvement of our internal control over financial reporting. While we have processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements, we plan to enhance these processes to better evaluate and understand the nuances of the complex accounting standards that apply to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Our plans at this time include providing enhanced access to accounting literature, research materials and documents and increased communication among our personnel and

 third-party service providers. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. This report does not include an attestation report of internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm due to our status as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Our directors and officers will play a key role in identifying, evaluating, and selecting target businesses, and structuring, negotiating and consummating our initial acquisition transaction. Except as described below and under Conflicts of Interest, none of these individuals is currently a principal of or affiliated with a public company or blank check company that executed a business plan similar to our business plan. We believe that the skills and experience of these individuals, their collective access to acquisition opportunities and ideas, their contacts, and their transaction expertise should enable them to identify successfully and effect an acquisition transaction, although we cannot assure you that they will, in fact, be able to do so. Officer and Director Qualifications Our officers and board of directors are composed of a diverse group of leaders with a wide array of professional roles. In these roles, they have gained experience in core management skills, such as strategic and financial planning, financial reporting, compliance, risk management, and leadership development. Many of our officers and directors also have experience serving on boards of directors and board committees of other companies, and have an understanding of corporate governance practices and trends, which provides an understanding of different business processes, challenges, and strategies. Further, our officers and directors also have other experience that makes them valuable, managing and investing assets or facilitating the consummation of business combinations.

Table of Contents 
 We, along with our officers and directors, believe that the above-mentioned attributes, along with the leadership skills and other experiences of our officers and board members described below, provide us with a diverse range of perspectives and judgment necessary to facilitate our goals of consummating an acquisition transaction. Board Committees Our Board of Directors has three standing committees: an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating committee. Each committee will operate under a charter that has been approved by our board and will have the composition and responsibilities described below. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, NASDAQ rules and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors, and NASDAQ rules require that the compensation committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. Audit Committee The Audit Committee, which is established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act, engages the Company s independent accountants, reviewing their independence and performance; the Company s accounting and financial reporting processes and the integrity of its financial statements; the audits of the Company s financial statements and the appointment, compensation, qualifications, independence and performance of the Company s independent auditors; the Company s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; and the performance of the Company s internal audit function and internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee held no formal meetings during 2022 as the Company does not have any underlying business or employees, relying on monthly reports and written approvals as required. The members of the Audit Committee are Mark Streeter, Joseph Chow and Rolf Hoefer, each of whom is an independent director under NASDAQ s listing standards. Joseph Chow is the Chairperson of the Audit Committee. The Board has determined that Joseph Chow qualifies as an audit committee financial expert, as defined under the rules and regulations of the SEC. Nominating Committee The Nominating Committee is responsible for overseeing the selection of persons to be nominated to serve on our Board. Specifically, the Nominating Committee makes recommendations to the Board regarding the size and composition of the Board, establishes procedures for the director nomination process and screens and recommends candidates for election to the Board. On an annual basis, the Nominating Committee recommends for approval by the Board certain desired qualifications and characteristics for board membership. Additionally, the Nominating Committee establishes and administers a periodic assessment procedure relating to the performance of the Board as a whole and its individual members. The Nominating Committee will consider a number of qualifications relating to management and leadership experience, background and integrity and professionalism in evaluating a person s candidacy for membership on the Board. The Nominating Committee may require certain skills or attributes, such as financial or accounting experience, to meet specific board needs that arise from time to time and will also consider the overall experience and makeup of its members to obtain a broad and diverse mix of board members. The nominating committee does not distinguish among nominees recommended by shareholders and other persons. The Nominating Committee did not hold any meetings in 2022. The members of the Nominating Committee are Mark Streeter, Joseph Chow and Rolf Hoefer, each of whom is an independent director under NASDAQ s listing standards. Joseph Chow is the Chairperson of the Nominating Committee. Compensation Committee The Compensation Committee reviews annually the Company s corporate goals and objectives relevant to the officers compensation, evaluates the officers performance in light of such goals and objectives, determines and approves the officers compensation level based on this evaluation, makes recommendations to the Board regarding approval, disapproval, modification, or termination of existing or proposed employee benefit plans, makes recommendations to the Board with respect to non-CEO and non-CFO compensation and administers the Company s incentive-compensation plans and equity-based plans. The Compensation Committee has the authority to delegate any of its responsibilities to subcommittees as it may deem appropriate in its sole discretion. The chief executive officer of the Company may not be present during voting or deliberations of the Compensation Committee with respect to his compensation. The Company s executive officers do not play a role in suggesting their own salaries. Neither the Company 
 19 

Table of Contents 
 nor the Compensation Committee has engaged any compensation consultant who has a role in determining or recommending the amount or form of executive or director compensation. The Compensation Committee did not meet in 2022. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as indicated above, no compensation of any kind, including finders, consulting or other similar fees, will be paid to any of our existing shareholders, including our directors, or any of their respective affiliates, prior to the consummation of a business combination. Accordingly, it is likely that prior to the consummation of an initial business combination, the compensation committee will only be responsible for the review and recommendation of any compensation arrangements to be entered into in connection with such initial business combination. The members of the Compensation Committee are Mark Streeter, Joseph Chow and Rolf Hoefer, each of whom is an independent director under NASDAQ s listing standards. Joseph Chow is the Chairperson of the Compensation Committee. Conflicts of Interest Under British Virgin Islands law, directors and officers owe the following fiduciary duties: duty to act in good faith in what the director or officer believes to be in the best interests of the company as a whole;
 duty to exercise powers for the purposes for which those powers were conferred and not for a collateral purpose;
 directors should not improperly fetter the exercise of future discretion;
 duty to exercise powers fairly as between different classes of shareholders;
 duty not to put themselves in a position in which there is a conflict between their duty to the company and their personal interests; and
 duty to exercise independent judgment.
 
 In addition to the above, directors also owe a duty of care which is not fiduciary in nature. This duty has been defined as a requirement to act as a reasonably diligent person having both the general knowledge, skill and experience that may reasonably be expected of a person carrying out the same functions as are carried out by that director in relation to the company and the general knowledge skill and experience which that director has. As set out above, directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position of conflict and this includes a duty not to engage in self-dealing, or to otherwise benefit as a result of their position. However, in some instances what would otherwise be a breach of this duty can be forgiven and/or authorized in advance by the shareholders provided that there is full disclosure by the directors. This can be done by way of permission granted in the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or alternatively by shareholder approval at general meetings. Each of our Sponsor, directors and officers presently has, and in the future any of our Sponsor, directors and our officers may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present acquisition opportunities to such entity. Accordingly, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under British Virgin Islands law, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an acquisition opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will need to honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such acquisition opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under British Virgin Islands law, we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any officer or director unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. We do not believe, however, that any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our directors or officers would materially undermine our ability to complete our business combination. Our Sponsor, officers and directors are, and may become sponsors, officers or directors of other special purpose acquisition companies. Notwithstanding that, such officers and directors will continue to have a pre-existing fiduciary obligation to us and we will, 
 20 

Table of Contents 
 therefore, have priority over any special purpose acquisition companies they subsequently join. Potential investors should also be aware of the following other potential conflicts of interest: None of our officers or directors is required to commit his or her full time to our affairs and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating his or her time among various business activities.
 In the course of their other business activities, our officers and directors may become aware of investment and business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as the other entities with which they are affiliated. Our management may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. For a complete description of our management s other affiliations, see Directors and Officers.
 Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to our founder shares and public shares in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination. Additionally, our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within 12 months after the closing of (or up to 18 months from the closing of the IPO if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time). If we do not complete our initial business combination within such applicable time period, the proceeds of the sale of the private placement units held in the Trust Account will be used to fund the redemption of our public shares and rights will expire worthless. With certain limited exceptions, the founder shares will not be transferable, assignable or salable by our Sponsor until the earlier of (1) six months after the completion of our initial business combination and (2) the date on which we consummate a liquidation, merger, share exchange, reorganization, or other similar transaction after our initial business combination that results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the last sale price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds 12.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share capitalizations, rights issuances, subdivisions, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing after our initial business combination, the founder shares will be released from the lock-up. With certain limited exceptions, the private placement units, private placement shares, private placement rights and the Class A ordinary shares underlying such rights will not be transferable, assignable or salable by our Sponsor until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. Since our Sponsor and officers and directors may directly or indirectly own ordinary shares and rights following the IPO, our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination.
 Our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
 
 The conflicts described above may not be resolved in our favor.

 Accordingly, as a result of multiple business affiliations, our officers and directors may have similar legal obligations relating to presenting business opportunities meeting the above-listed criteria to multiple entities. Below is a table summarizing the entities to which our officers and directors currently have fiduciary duties or contractual obligations: 

Name of Individual Name of Affiliated Company Industry of Affiliated Company Affiliation Alan Yamashita Polar Ventures Limited Invion Limited Investment management life sciences Managing Partner Director Alex Yamashita Cultur3 Capital Investment Manager Director Mark Streeter Van Bers Consulting strategic growth consulting Founder Rolf Hoefer Cultur3 Capital Cultur3 Numomo Investment Manager Agency Investment Manager Agency Joseph Chow Integrated Waste Solutions Group Holding Wellington Legal integrated waste solutions provider legal services Independent Director Partner Naphat Sirimongkolkasem Black Chimp Limited Collis Capital Limited Sigma Investment Holding Limited Delta Investment Holding Limited Investment holding asset management and investment advisory service investment holding investment holding Director Co-founder Director Director In connection with the vote required for any business combination, all of our existing shareholders, including all of our officers and directors, have agreed to vote their respective insider shares and private shares in favor of any proposed business combination. In addition, they have agreed to waive their respective rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to those ordinary shares acquired by them prior to the IPO. If they purchased ordinary shares in the IPO or in the open market, however, they would be entitled to participate in any liquidation distribution in respect of such shares but have agreed not to convert such shares (or sell their shares in any tender offer) in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination or an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association relating to pre-business combination activity. All ongoing and future transactions between us and any of our officers and directors or their respective affiliates will be on terms believed by us to be no less favorable to us than are available from unaffiliated third parties. Such transactions will require prior approval by our audit committee and a majority of our uninterested independent directors, or the members of our board who do not have an interest in the transaction, in either case who had access, at our expense, to our attorneys or independent legal counsel. We will not enter into any such transaction unless our audit committee and a majority of our disinterested independent directors determine that the terms of such transaction are no less favorable to us than those that would be available to us with respect to such a transaction from unaffiliated third parties. To further minimize conflicts of interest, we have agreed not to consummate our initial business combination with an entity that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or initial shareholders, unless we have obtained (i) an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated shareholders from a financial point of view and (ii) the approval of a majority of our disinterested and independent directors (if we have any at that time). Furthermore, in no event will any of our initial shareholders, officers, directors, special advisors or their respective affiliates be paid any finder s fee, consulting fee or other similar compensation prior to the consummation of our initial business combination. Code of Ethics We adopted a code of conduct and ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. The code of ethics codifies the business and ethical principles that govern all aspects of our business.

Table of Contents 
 Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, requires our executive officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10 of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our ordinary shares and other equity securities. These executive officers, directors, and greater than 10 beneficial owners are required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms filed by such reporting persons. Based solely on our review of such forms furnished to us and written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that all filing requirements applicable to our executive officers, directors and greater than 10 beneficial owners were filed in a timely manner during 2022. ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Employment Agreements We have not entered into any employment agreements with our executive officers, and have not made any agreements to provide benefits upon termination of employment. Executive Officers and Director Compensation No executive officer has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. No compensation of any kind, including finders, consulting or other similar fees, will be paid to any of our existing shareholders, including our directors, or any of their respective affiliates, prior to the consummation of a business combination. However, such individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. There is no limit on the amount of these out-of-pocket expenses and there will be no review of the reasonableness of the expenses by anyone other than our board of directors and audit committee, which includes persons who may seek reimbursement, or a court of competent jurisdiction if such reimbursement is challenged. ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS The following table sets forth as of March 2, 2023 the number of Ordinary Shares beneficially owned by (i) each person who is known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares, (ii) each of our officers and directors and (iii) all of our officers and directors as a group.

 ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE In February and March 2021, our Sponsor purchased 1,437,500 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of 25,001, or approximately 0.017 per share. Our Sponsor will own 20 of our issued and outstanding shares after the IPO (assuming it does not purchase units in the IPO and excluding the private placement shares and the Representative s shares) and will have the right to elect all of our directors prior to our initial business combination. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, on June 14, 2021, the Company consummated the private placement (the Private Placement with BSG First Euro Investment Corp., the Company s Sponsor, of 292,500 units (the Private Units at a price of 10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of 2,925,000. The Private Units are identical to the Units sold in the IPO. Additionally, such initial purchasers agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the Registration Statement) until 30 days after the completion of the Company s initial business combination. Such initial purchasers were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the Private Units. The Private Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering. In order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of the IPO, our initial shareholders, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of the closing of the IPO or the date which the company determines not to conduct the IPO. These loans will be repaid upon the closing of the IPO out of the 500,000 of offering proceeds not held in the Trust Account. On March 1, 2021, the Company issued the Promissory Note to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of 200,000. The Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable on the date that the Company consummates the IPO of its securities or the date on which the Company determines not to conduct an IPO, however, the date was extended to August 31, 2022, provided that the Company may in its sole discretion, and upon written notice to Sponsor, extend such maturity date for an additional six months in the event that the Company has not repaid in full the principal amount and accrued interest by August 31, 2022 pursuant to the amended Promissory Note issued on May 30, 2022. On August 31, 2022, the Company issued an extension notice to the Sponsor, to extend the maturity date of the Promissory Note for an additional six (6) months from August 31, 2022 to February 28, 2023.

The holders of founder shares, private placement units, shares being issued to the underwriters of the IPO, and units that may be issued on conversion of working capital loans (and in each case holders of their component securities, as applicable) will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement requiring us to register such securities for resale (in the case of the founder shares, only after conversion to our Class A ordinary shares). The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities.The holders of a majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands that we register such securities. The holders of a majority of the private units or securities issued in payment of working capital loans made to us can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time after we consummate a business combination. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our consummation of a business combination. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. No compensation or fees of any kind, including finder s fees, consulting fees, reimbursements or cash payments made to our Sponsor, officers or directors, or any of their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that is), other than the following payments, none of which will be made from the proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the private placement units held in the Trust Account prior to the completion of our initial business combination: (i) repayment of an aggregate of up to 200,000 in loans made to us by our Sponsor to cover offering-related and organizational expenses; (ii) payment to an affiliate of our Sponsor of a total of 10,000 per month for office space, administrative and support services; (iii) reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination; and (iv) repayment of loans which may be made by our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, the terms of which have not been determined nor have any written agreements been executed with respect thereto. Up to 1,150,000 of such loans may be convertible into units at a price of 10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. These payments may be funded using the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the private placement units not held in the Trust Account or, upon completion of the initial

 business combination, from any amounts remaining from the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us in connection therewith. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our Sponsor, officers or directors, or our or their affiliates. All ongoing and future transactions between us and any of our officers and directors or their respective affiliates will be on terms believed by us to be no less favorable to us than are available from unaffiliated third parties. Such transactions, including the payment of any compensation, will require prior approval by a majority of our uninterested independent directors (to the extent we have any) or the members of our board who do not have an interest in the transaction, in either case who had access, at our expense, to our attorneys or independent legal counsel. We will not enter into any such transaction unless our disinterested independent directors (or, if there are no independent directors, our disinterested directors) determine that the terms of such transaction are no less favorable to us than those that would be available to us with respect to such a transaction from unaffiliated third parties. Related Party Policy Our Code of Ethics requires us to avoid, wherever possible, all related party transactions that could result in actual or potential conflicts of interests, except under guidelines approved by the board of directors (or the audit committee). Related-party transactions are defined as transactions in which (1) the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed 120,000 in any calendar year, (2) we or any of our subsidiaries is a participant, and (3) any (a) executive officer, director or nominee for election as a director, (b) greater than 5 beneficial owner of our ordinary shares, or (c) immediate family member, of the persons referred to in clauses (a) and (b), has or will have a direct or indirect material interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than 10 beneficial owner of another entity). A conflict of interest situation can arise when a person takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise if a person, or a member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position. Our audit committee, pursuant to its written charter, will be responsible for reviewing and approving related-party transactions to the extent we enter into such transactions. All ongoing and future transactions between us and any of our officers and directors or their respective affiliates will be on terms believed by us to be no less favorable to us than are available from unaffiliated third parties. Such transactions will require prior approval by our audit committee and a majority of our uninterested independent directors, or the members of our board who do not have an interest in the transaction, in either case who had access, at our expense, to our attorneys or independent legal counsel. We will not enter into any such transaction unless our audit committee and a majority of our disinterested independent directors determine that the terms of such transaction are no less favorable to us than those that would be available to us with respect to such a transaction from unaffiliated third parties. Additionally, we require each of our directors and executive officers to complete a directors and officers questionnaire that elicits information about related party transactions. These procedures are intended to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a conflict of interest on the part of a director, employee or officer. To further minimize potential conflicts of interest, we have agreed not to consummate a business combination with an entity which is affiliated with any of our initial shareholders unless we obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated shareholders from a financial point of view. Furthermore, in no event will any of our existing officers, directors or initial shareholders, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to the consummation of a business combination. Director Independence Nasdaq listing standards require that within one year of the listing of our securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market we have at least three independent directors and that a majority of our board of directors be independent. For a description of the director independence, see above Part III, Item 10 Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance. ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Blue Safari Group Acquisition Corp. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Blue Safari Group Acquisition Corp. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders deficit and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from February 23, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from February 23, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Explanatory Paragraph Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has a significant working capital deficiency, has incurred significant costs and needs to raise additional funds to meet its obligations and sustain its operations and the Company s business plan is dependent on the completion of a business combination. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit s . We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Marcum LLP We have served as the Company s auditor since 2021. March 3, 2023
