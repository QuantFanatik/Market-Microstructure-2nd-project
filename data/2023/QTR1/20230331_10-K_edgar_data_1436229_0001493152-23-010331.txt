BTCS
Inc. BTCS or the Company is an early entrant in the crypto asset (also referred to cryptocurrencies ,
 crypto , or tokens market and one of the first U.S. publicly-traded companies with a primary focus on blockchain
infrastructure and staking. Through our blockchain-infrastructure operations, we secure and operate validator nodes on disruptive next-generation
blockchain networks that power Web3, earning native token rewards by staking our proof-of-stake crypto assets. Our Digital Asset Platform,
StakeSeeker, is designed to empower users to better understand and grow their crypto holdings with innovative portfolio analytics and
a non-custodial process to earn staking rewards through the direct participation in blockchain consensus algorithms. 

BLOCKCHAIN
INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 

The
primary objective of blockchain infrastructure operations is to secure blockchains by validating transactions and earning rewards for
doing so. Two main consensus mechanisms are currently used to secure blockchains: proof-of-work PoW and proof-of-stake PoS ). 

PoW
is a consensus mechanism that requires nodes to dedicate computational resources to validate transactions on a blockchain. In PoW, miners
use energy-consuming computers to do work, and they are rewarded with crypto assets for validating transactions on the
blockchain. The reward is comprised of transaction fees and crypto assets. Bitcoin is an example of a PoW blockchain, and it is the largest
and most secure PoW blockchain. 

PoS
is a consensus mechanism that requires validator nodes (or nodes to dedicate financial resources, such as staking holdings
of a crypto asset, to participate in the consensus algorithm. Validators, the equivalent of miners in PoW networks, operate nodes and
validate transactions on the blockchain. Validators are rewarded in crypto assets for aligning behavior with the rules of the algorithm.
Bad behavior can be penalized by slashing the validator s holdings and/or rewards. Validators can also be removed from the network
for breaking the network rules. Ill-intentioned behavior among validators is discouraged, allowing for the blockchain to be properly
maintained and secured. PoS blockchains consume over 99 less energy than PoW blockchains, according to the Ethereum Foundation. 

Delegated
proof-of-stake DPoS is a PoS variant blockchain consensus mechanism where token holders can participate
in a blockchain network by either running their own validator node Validator or delegating their holdings to existing
validator nodes and earning rewards for securing the network Delegation , Delegating or Staking ). 

Delegation
is a non-custodial process that allows token holders Delegators to maintain control of their private keys and revoke
their delegation at any time (subject to the rules of a particular blockchain). There is no transfer of ownership, often referred to
as private keys of Delegator s crypto assets as part of the Delegation process. Delegation provides a method for
token holders to designate to a validator node operator the ministerial task of running a validator node while still participating in
the network consensus mechanism and earning rewards. 

The
crypto asset reward is determined by the blockchain networks consensus algorithm, can change over time, and varies from blockchain to
blockchain. A Validator broadcasts to the network its fee, typically as a percent of the crypto asset reward, which is publicly available.
Both the reward paid to the Delegator and the fee paid to the Validator are distributed by the blockchain network. The Validator never
takes possession of either the Delegators staked crypto assets or crypto asset rewards. 

OUR
BUSINESS 

BTCS
is committed to operating blockchain infrastructure as a Validator that is secure, efficient, and scalable. We specialize in operating
validator nodes on various DPoS and PoS-based blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Cosmos, Kava, Tezos, Avalanche, Kusama, Mina,
Akash, Cardano, Oasis, and NEAR Protocol. The Company stakes the crypto assets native to these blockchains on the validator nodes it
operates to earn rewards in connection with the validation of transactions occurring on those blockchain networks. 

BTCS s
blockchain infrastructure operations form the core growth for its Digital Asset Platform, StakeSeeker. BTCS utilizes cloud
infrastructure to operate and run its validator nodes and does not operate a data center or own physical assets such as servers.
BTCS plans to expand its PoS operations to secure other disruptive blockchain protocols that allow for Delegating. 

Staking-as-a-service StaaS is a central component of BTCS s strategy. StaaS allows crypto asset holders to earn rewards by participating
in network consensus mechanisms through Staking and Delegating their crypto assets to Company-operated validator nodes. As a non-custodial
Validator operator, BTCS receives a percentage of token holders staking rewards generated as a validator node fee, creating the
opportunity for potential scalable revenue and business growth with limited additional costs. 

In
January 2023, the Company launched a beta version of StakeSeeker, its proprietary Digital Asset Platform. StakeSeeker is a comprehensive
crypto dashboard and education center for crypto asset holders to learn how to earn crypto rewards by Staking through its non-custodial
Stake Hub and evaluate their crypto portfolios across exchanges and wallets in a single analytics platform. The internally-developed
dashboard utilizes application programming interfaces (APIs) to read user data from digital wallets and crypto exchanges and does not
allow for the trading of crypto assets. 

The
delegation process central to DPoS blockchains and our StaaS strategy revolves around the non-custodial nature of these networks. The
blockchain network calculates rewards earned, which are then distributed directly to the Delegator s wallet. At no point does the
Validator take custody of the staked crypto assets or rewards earned through Staking. Therefore, BTCS does not obtain custody or facilitate
transfers of any third-party assets in its role as a Validator or StaaS provider. 

The
self-custody of crypto assets by Delegators is a critical aspect of our non-custodial staking model. Recent headlines of bankruptcies,
fraud, risk management failures, and misappropriation of customer assets in the crypto industry have raised concerns about the security
of custodial exchanges and similar platforms. BTCS ensures that substantially all of its crypto assets are held in secure digital wallets,
with less than 0.1 of its crypto assets on crypto exchanges. Our exposure to companies such as FTX, Blockfi, and Celsius is limited
to the negative impact these platforms had on the value of our assets in the crypto markets. 

StakeSeeker s
Stake Hub is central to BTCS s growth strategy, allowing users to Delegate their crypto assets to the Company s validator
nodes. The growth of both StakeSeeker s user base as well as the number and size of staked crypto assets by Delegators to Company-run
validator nodes is critical to BTCS s strategy and success. The Company believes that StaaS provides a more accessible and cost-effective
way for crypto asset holders to participate in blockchain network consensus mechanisms, thereby promoting the growth and adoption of
blockchain technology. 

Details
of the Company s crypto asset held can be found under Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations.

INDUSTRY
AND MARKET OVERVIEW (CRYPTO ASSET AND BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGIES) 

Blockchain
and Cryptocurrencies 

Distributed
blockchain technologies utilize a decentralized and encrypted ledger that is designed to offer a secure, efficient, verifiable, and permanent
way of storing records and other information without the need for intermediaries. Crypto assets, which include and are often referred
to as cryptocurrencies, serve multiple purposes. They can serve as a medium of exchange, store of value or unit of account, and provide
non-financial and next generation uses. Blockchain technologies are being evaluated for a multitude of industries due to their potential
impact in many areas of business, finance, information management, and governance. 

Cryptocurrencies
are decentralized currencies that enable near instantaneous transfers. Transactions occur via an open source, cryptographic protocol
platform which uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority. An online network of nodes hosts a public transaction
ledger, known as a blockchain, and each cryptocurrency is associated with a source code that comprises the basis for the cryptographic
and algorithmic protocols governing its blockchain. In a cryptocurrency network, every peer node has its own copy of the blockchain,
which contains records of every historical transaction - effectively containing records of all account balances. Each account is identified
solely by its unique public key (making it effectively anonymous) and is secured with its associated private key (a password). The combination
of private and public cryptographic keys constitutes a secure digital identity in the form of a digital signature, providing strong control
of ownership. 

Most blockchain network infrastructures are collectively maintained by a decentralized public user base. As a network
is decentralized, it does not rely on either governmental authorities or financial institutions to create, transmit or determine the
value of the currency units. Rather, the value is determined by market factors, supply and demand for the units, the prices being set
in transfers by mutual agreement or barter among transacting parties. Since transfers do not require involvement of intermediaries or
third parties, there are currently limited transaction costs in direct peer-to-peer transactions. Units of cryptocurrency can be converted
to fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, at rates determined on various cryptocurrency exchanges. Cryptocurrency prices are quoted
on various exchanges and fluctuate with extreme volatility. 

4 

We
believe certain cryptocurrencies offer many advantages over traditional fiat currencies, although many of these factors also present
potential disadvantages and may introduce additional risks, including: 

Acting
 as a fraud deterrent, as cryptocurrencies are digital and cannot be counterfeited or reversed arbitrarily by a sender; 

Immediate
 settlement; 

Elimination
 of counterparty risk; 

No
 trusted intermediary required; 

Lower
 fees; 

Identity
 theft prevention; 

Accessible
 by everyone; 

Transactions
 are verified and protected through a confirmation process, which prevents the problem of double spending; 

Decentralized
 no central authority (government or financial institution); and 

Recognized
 universally and not bound by government imposed or market exchange rates. 

However,
cryptocurrencies may not provide all of the benefits they purport to offer at all or at any time. Businesses, including the Company,
seeking to develop upon, adopt, transact or rely upon blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies operate within an untested and evolving
environment. As with any new and emerging technology, there are potentially significant risks, not only related to the businesses 
opportunities the Company pursues, but also to the sector and industry as a whole, as well as the entirety of the concept behind blockchain
and cryptocurrency as value. 

Business
Profile and Risks 

The
decision to pursue blockchain and crypto asset businesses exposes the Company to risks associated with a new and untested strategic direction.
The prices of crypto assets have experienced substantial volatility, which may reflect bubble type volatility, meaning
that high or low prices may have little or no merit, are subject to rapidly changing investor sentiment, and may be influenced by factors
such as technology, regulatory void or changes, fraudulent actors, manipulation, and media reporting. 

5 

Government
Oversight 

Blockchain
networks are a relatively new technological innovation and the regulatory schemes to which crypto assets and their blockchain networks
are or may be subject, including both the interpretation and applicability of existing laws and regulations and the potential establishment
of new laws and regulations, have not been fully explored or developed. 

Recent
actions taken by the SEC, including enforcement actions brought against crypto asset companies with a focus on custodial staking, as
are more particularly described under certain Risk Factors , demonstrate the SEC s position that many, if not
most, crypto assets may be securities and therefore reflect the reality that we will likely face increased government regulation and
oversight as our industry and government treatment of the crypto assets on which our operations are based continue to evolve. These
developments follow the SEC s July 25, 2017 DAO Report, wherein its Chairman expressed concerns about the Wild
West nature of the cryptocurrency market. More recently, the SEC Enforcement Division has taken action against crypto asset
focused enterprises, and if the interpretations of federal securities laws are further expanded to apply to the Company, it would
adversely affect the Company s future acquisition of crypto assets by limiting the amount of crypto asset securities Digital Securities it may acquire, potentially limiting or precluding the use of its staking-as-a-service platform,
and creating increased compliance and legal costs. In addition, each state has its own securities laws and regulations with varying
provisions and effect, any of which may require us to alter or reduce our current or planned operations in the future. We continue
to monitor legislative matters related to our industry. 

Because
of the foregoing or other regulatory developments, in the future before we acquire or transact in crypto assets, we may be required to
examine how they were originally offered to determine if they were offered as an investment contract or other type of security. Because
of legal uncertainties, careful examination of the results of our compliance review will be required by experienced securities counsel.
Because we must stay under the requirement under Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act that no more than 40 of
our assets (excluding cash items) constitute investment securities to avoid being deemed an investment company, we will limit the amount
of Digital Securities we acquire. Further, while we believe our operations and platform are meaningfully different than Kraken s
custodial staking platform that was subject to SEC enforcement proceedings in early 2023, that development or future positions the SEC
may take, including potentially against us and our business, may demonstrate a differing view and require us to adjust, reduce, limit
or even cease some or all of our operations or business plans. If our compliance procedures and legal reviews prove to be incorrect,
we may incur the likelihood of prohibitive SEC penalties and/or private lawsuit defense costs and adverse rulings. 

Gary
Gensler, the current SEC Chairman, has continued to voice his concerns about and continued intention to regulate crypto assets, referring
to decentralized finance, or DeFi, platforms that focus on crypto assets as well as the crypto assets themselves, and concluding by stating
that the SEC would continue to take our authorities as far as they go. There has not been any definitive guidance provided
as of the date of this Report, however a number of regulatory proceedings and enforcement actions have been brought against crypto assets
developers and their proponents. 

The
Company intends to acquire additional crypto assets and to continue to develop and expand upon its Digital Asset Platform to enable
it to offer a wider range of functions and availability for use with a greater variety of crypto assets. The Company currently owns
and plans to expand its crypto asset holdings, both through staking its existing crypto asset holdings on PoS blockchain networks
and potentially through other means. In order to avoid being classified as an inadvertent investment company under the 1940 Act, we
actively focus, in consultation with legal counsel, on ensuring that our ownership of assets that are not considered securities
under the Act always exceed 60 of our total assets, excluding cash items. By doing so, we can avoid being subject to the regulatory
requirements and oversight that apply to investment companies. The ownership of crypto assets including Digital Securities may
change based on the definition of a security under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act and applicable
court decisions. The key definition is the term investment contract and what is an investment contract. 

In
addition to the securities laws and investment company considerations, as our business model and operations continue to evolve,
including our Digital Asset Platform and its functionality, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations. For example,
to the extent we collect, analyze, distribute, or otherwise use data concerning individuals or entities and their holdings and
transactions, we may become subject to the ever-growing number of data privacy and security laws within and without the U.S. which
often have far-reaching implications for businesses. In general these laws require disclosure and preventative measures designed to
protect users from unauthorized access or disclosure of their personal information, and impose fines and sanctions for failure to
comply with their requirements. On the other hand, because transactions in crypto assets often provide a reasonable degree of
anonymity, they are susceptible to misuse for criminal activities, such as money laundering. This misuse, or the perception of such
misuse (even if untrue), could lead to greater regulatory oversight of crypto platforms and operations such as ours, and there is
the possibility that regulators could close crypto platforms or other crypto asset-related technology and infrastructure with little
or no notice or opportunity for challenge, and prevent users of custodial platforms from accessing or retrieving crypto assets held
on or connected to such platforms or infrastructure. For example, lawmakers and regulators have in recent years expressed views that
government oversight is needed, including with a view to curtailing the use of crypto asset use for malign and illegal
activities. 

Many
PoW crypto assets have also been subject to skepticism due to concerns about the high energy consumption used in mining on
blockchain networks. For example, in September 24, 2021, China declared all transactions in and mining of crypto assets, including
Bitcoin, illegal based on concerns of high energy consumption. In the U.S., in March 2022 President Biden issued Executive
Order 14067 on Ensuring the Responsible Development of Digital Assets , which prioritized the responsible development of
crypto assets in a manner which includes reducing negative climate impacts and environmental pollution. While our focus is currently
on PoS blockchain networks which use significantly lower amounts of energy when compared to PoW, future regulations may arise in
response to these concerns that could apply to us and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. 

Given
the growing interest by regulators and other stakeholders, we anticipate that legislation and regulation of crypto assets is forthcoming
in the future. 

Given
the above developments, both our current and planned operations, and the cryptocurrency industry in general, continue to be subject to
expanding, complex and uncertain government oversight. See Risk Factors beginning on page 17 and Business 
beginning on page 3 for more information. 

As
both the regulatory landscape develops and journalistic familiarity with crypto assets increases, mainstream media s understanding
of them and the regulation thereof may improve. Regulation of crypto assets varies from country to country as well as within countries.
An increase in the regulation of crypto assets may affect our proposed business by increasing compliance costs or prohibiting certain
or all of our proposed activities. 

6 

COMPETITION 

The
Company s current and future competition for our Digital Asset Platform is centered on the following areas: 

Exchange based companies which offer custodial and/or non-custodial
 staking solutions. These exchanges have more robust customer bases to attract integrated staking services and may have more
 resources to enhance either their custodial or non-custodial efforts in the future; 

Other
 crypto asset focused companies and node operators, such as Blockdaemon, Allnodes, Everstake, Staked (acquired by Kraken), Figment,
 P2P, Foundry, and Stakefish, that offer non-custodial crypto asset staking and run validator nodes; 

Other
 mobile applications, websites, niche aggregation sites, which offer similar analytic services, such as CoinTracker, Koinly, CoinLedger
 and Rotki; 

Providers
 of mobile applications and websites, that offer secure storage solutions for crypto assets; 

Existing
 financial service firms and data analytics firms serving traditional asset markets that choose to offer data analytic solutions for
 crypto assets; and 

Cryptocurrency
 focused companies that offer exchange, payment processing, and financial services for crypto assets. 

Many
of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more users, and greater brand recognition. They may
devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, marketing and may be able to more rapidly develop their solutions. Other companies
also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. Our small team and relative lack
of capital is a competitive disadvantage. 

ASSETS 

The
Company s primary assets consist of its crypto assets and cash as well as its human capital and intellectual property noted below. 

INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY AND TRADE SECRETS 

Our
business depends in large part on our proprietary technology, particularly with regards to our Digital Asset Platform and operation of
validator nodes as part of our blockchain infrastructure, and our brand. We rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, a combination
of trademark, domain name, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, contractors,
consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, to establish and protect our brand and intellectual property rights. 

GROWTH
STRATEGY 

Digital
Asset Platform - StakeSeeker 

Staking-as-a-service
is a central component of BTCS s strategy. StaaS allows crypto asset holders to earn rewards by participating in network consensus
mechanisms through Staking and Delegating their cryptocurrencies to Company-operated validator nodes. As a non-custodial Validator operator,
BTCS receives a percentage of token holders staking rewards generated as a validator node fee, creating the opportunity for potential
scalable revenue and business growth with limited additional costs. The staking rewards are paid directly by the network to the token
holder s digital wallet and BTCS never takes custody of any staked tokens or earned rewards. 

In
January 2023, the Company launched the beta of StakeSeeker, BTCS s proprietary Digital Asset Platform. StakeSeeker is a comprehensive
crypto dashboard and education center for crypto asset holders to learn how to earn crypto rewards by Staking through its non-custodial
Stake Hub and evaluate their crypto portfolios across exchanges and wallets in a single analytics platform. Our internally-developed
dashboard utilizes APIs to read user data from digital wallets and crypto exchanges and does not allow for the trading of assets. 

StakeSeeker s
Stake Hub is central to BTCS s growth strategy. The growth of both StakeSeeker s user base as well as the amount of staked
cryptocurrencies by Delegators to Company-run validator nodes are critical to BTCS s growth strategy and success. The Company believes
that StaaS provides a more accessible and cost-effective way for crypto asset holders to directly participate in blockchain networks 
consensus mechanisms while maintaining custody of both their staked crypto assets and crypto rewards, thereby promoting the growth and
adoption of blockchain technology.

7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

INTRODUCTION 

The
following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our historical
financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this report. Certain statements in the discussion contain
forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as plans, objectives, expectations
and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements
as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report. When we
refer to the Fiscal 2022 and the Fiscal 2021 we are referring to the years ended December 31, 2022 and December
31, 2021, respectively. 

OVERVIEW 

BTCS
is an early entrant in the cryptocurrency market and one of the first publicly-traded U.S. companies with a primary focus on blockchain
infrastructure and staking. We specialize in operating validator nodes on various DPoS and PoS-based blockchain networks and stake the
native crypto assets on these blockchains to earn rewards in connection with transaction validation. Our core growth for our Digital
Asset Platform, StakeSeeker, comes from our blockchain infrastructure operations. StakeSeeker is a non-custodial platform that enables
users to learn how to earn staking rewards and analyze their crypto portfolios through a comprehensive crypto dashboard and education
center. 

We
employ a StaaS strategy that allows crypto asset holders to earn rewards by participating in network consensus mechanisms through staking
and delegating their crypto assets to Company-operated validator nodes. As a non-custodial validator operator, we receive a percentage
of token holders staking rewards generated as a validator node fee, creating the opportunity for potential scalable revenue and
business growth with limited additional costs. Our non-custodial staking model ensures the self-custody of crypto assets, mitigating concerns about the security of custodial exchanges and similar platforms. 

We
believe that our blockchain infrastructure and StaaS strategy provide us with a unique competitive advantage in the rapidly evolving
blockchain industry. We plan to expand our PoS operations to secure other disruptive blockchain protocols that allow for delegating and
asset leveraging, which presents a significant growth opportunity for the Company. The growth of StakeSeeker s user base as well
as the number and size of staked cryptocurrencies by Delegators to Company-run validator nodes are critical to our success. We believe
that StaaS provides a more accessible and cost-effective way for crypto asset holders to participate in blockchain networks consensus
mechanisms, promoting the growth and adoption of blockchain technology. 

As
a non-custodial StaaS provider, we do not hold or take possession of any Delegator funds, crypto assets, or crypto asset rewards at any
point during the Staking process. Delegation does not involve the transfer of token ownership to a Validator. While staking delegated
 tokens remain in
the Delegator s digital wallets. The blockchain network calculates rewards earned, which are then distributed directly to the Delegator s
wallet. At no point does the Validator gain access or control to the custody of the original staked tokens or rewards earned through
Staking to its node. Therefore, the Company does not have any exposure to the custodial risks that a crypto exchange would have related
to excessive redemptions or withdrawals of crypto assets, suspension of redemptions or withdrawals. Further, we do not issue or hold
crypto assets on behalf of the third parties and have no exposure to the risks an exchange would have with respect to loans, rehypothecation
and margin.

Validator
Revenue 

The
increase in revenue during Fiscal 2022 is from the expansion of our blockchain infrastructure validating revenue. We believe revenues
will increase as the Company continues to expand its blockchain infrastructure efforts and as a result of an improvement in market prices
of the crypto assets we have staked. 

Cost
of Revenues 

The
increase in cost of revenues during Fiscal 2022 is due to our blockchain infrastructure validating operating costs, including, web service
hosting fees and services provided by vendors. We believe our cost of revenues will increase as we continue to ramp up our business.
However, we believe gross margin will improve as we add scale to our blockchain infrastructure operations and reduce costs as a result
of increased operational efficiencies, leading to improved gross profits. 

Operating
expenses 

The
decrease in operating expenses during Fiscal 2022 is primarily due to the 14.9 million equity-based contingent bonuses granted to
employees and our non-employee directors during Fiscal 2021 for the achievement of performance milestones compared to only 2.6
million equity-based compensation in Fiscal 2022. This is partially offset by the 13.3 million impairment loss on crypto assets Crypto Asset Impairment in Fiscal 2022, compared
to only 3.8 million Crypto Asset Impairment in Fiscal 2021. 

We
believe operating expenses will remain consistent as the Company continues to utilize equity-based compensation incentives as a core
part of our compensation strategy. However, volatility in the cryptocurrency markets will subject the Company to the possibility of
additional impairment charges on its crypto asset holdings. 

The
Company is evaluating additional opportunities to reduce costs. As part of our cost cutting measures, in June 2022, the Board of Directors
reduced all director fees for 2022 from 50,000 to 25,000 and reduced the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance
committee chair fees for 2022 to 5,000. Additionally, the Company s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Operating Officer, each agreed to forfeit 25,000 of their annual base salaries for 2022. Collectively, these cost-cutting
measures resulted in cost savings of approximately 141,000 for 2022. 

Other
Income (Expenses) 

The
changes in other income for the years reported was primarily due to the decrease in the fair value of warrant liabilities. This non-cash
expense is driven by the value of our stock price at the end of each quarter which we cannot predict. 

Net
loss 

The
slight decrease in our net loss for the years reported was primarily due to the decrease in operating expenses and changes in other income
(expense) as discussed above. We believe that our net loss may increase as the Company incurs increased costs related to the development
of its Digital Asset Platform and incurs additional Crypto Asset Impairment losses due to volatility in the cryptocurrency markets.

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Recent
Financing 

On
September 14, 2021, the Company entered into an At-The-Market Offering Agreement (the ATM Agreement with H.C. Wainwright
 Co., LLC, as agent H.C. Wainwright ), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time-to-time through
H.C. Wainwright, shares of the Company s Common Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 98,767,500. From the
period September 14, 2021 through March 28, 2023, the Company sold a total of 2,934,433 shares of Common Stock under the ATM Agreement
for aggregate total gross proceeds of approximately 14,986,000 at an average selling price of 5.11 per share, resulting in net
proceeds of approximately 14,510,000 after deducting commissions and other transaction costs. 

Liquidit y 

The
Company s financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity
of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate
on an ongoing basis. At December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 2.1 million of cash. 

We
view our crypto assets as long-term holdings and we do not plan to engage in regular trading of crypto assets. Further certain of our
staked crypto assets may be locked up depending on a the specific blockchain protocol and we may be unable to unstake them in a timely
manner in order to liquidate to the extended desired. During times of instability in the market of crypto assets, we may not be able
to sell our crypto assets at reasonable prices or at all. As a result, our crypto assets may not be able to serve as a source of liquidity
for us to the same extent as cash and cash equivalents. 

As
of March 28, 2023, the Company had approximately 1.5 million of cash and the fair market value of the Company s liquid crypto
assets was approximately 3.6 million, which excludes 15.2 million of staked Ethereum. The Company has no outstanding debt. As of March
28, 2023, the Company also has approximately 6.5 million available under the ATM Agreement over the next twelve
months under the Form S-3 baby shelf rules, although, the amount that we may raise under the Form S-3 may increase or decrease based
upon our stock price. The Company believes that the existing cash and liquid crypto assets held by us, in addition to the funds available
to the Company from the issuance of additional stock through the ATM Agreement, provide sufficient liquidity to meet working capital
requirements, anticipated capital expenditures and contractual obligations for at least the next twelve months. 

Cash
Flows 

Cash
used in operating activities was 0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 4.9 million during the year ended
December 31, 2021. 

Cash
used in investing activities was 9.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 9.5 million for the year ended December
31, 2021. Net cash outflow for investing activities was used primarily for the purchase of crypto assets for blockchain infrastructure
operations. 

Cash
provided by financing activities was 10.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 15.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021. The cash inflows from financing activities in Fiscal 2022 were primarily from proceeds of Common Stock sold pursuant
to the ATM Agreement 11.1 million). This was partially offset by a one-time return of capital distribution of 631,000 made to record
holders as of March 17, 2022. The Company has plans to continue to raise proceeds from the sale of Common Stock to fund operations as
needed. 

Off
Balance Sheet Transactions 

As
of December 31, 2022, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements and we were not a party to any off-balance sheet transactions. We
have no guarantees or obligations other than those which arise out of normal business operations.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

We
believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this management
discussion and analysis: 

Accounting
Treatment of Crypto Assets 

The
Company accounts for its crypto assets as indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill
and Other . An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently,
when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired.
Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. In testing for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform
a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is determined that it is not
more likely than not that an impairment exists, a quantitative impairment test is not necessary. If the Company concludes otherwise,
it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test. To the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new
cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted. 

Crypto
assets held are included in the balance sheets as either current assets or other assets if they are staked and locked up for over
one year. The Company s crypto assets are initially recorded at fair value upon receipt (or carrying value ). The
fair value of crypto assets is determined using the U.S. dollar spot price of the related crypto asset subsequent to its
acquisition. On a quarterly basis, crypto assets are measured at carrying value, net of any impairment losses incurred since
receipt. The Company will record impairment losses as the fair value falls below the carrying value of the crypto assets at any time
during the period, as determined using the lowest U.S. dollar spot price of the related crypto asset subsequent to its acquisition.
The crypto assets can only be marked down when impaired and not marked up when their value increases. 

Such
impairment in the value of crypto assets is recorded as a component of costs and expenses in our statements of operations. The Company
recorded impairment losses of approximately 13.3 million and 3.8 million related to crypto assets during the years ended December 31,
2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Impairment
losses cannot be recovered for any subsequent increase in fair value until the sale or disposal of the asset. Realized gain (loss) on
sale of crypto assets are included in other income (expense) in the statements of operations. The Company recorded realized gains (losses)
on crypto assets of approximately 0.5 million and 3.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

The
presentation of purchases and sales of crypto assets on the Statement of Cash Flows is determined by the nature of the crypto assets,
which can be characterized as productive (i.e. purchased for purposes of staking) or non-productive. The purchase of non-productive crypto
assets and currencies are included as an operating activity, whereas the purchase of productive crypto assets and currencies are included
as investing activities in accordance with ASC 230-10-20 Investing activities. Productive crypto assets that are staked with a
lock-up period of less than 12 months are presented on the Balance Sheet as current assets. Staked crypto assets with remaining lock-up
periods of greater than 12 months are presented as long-term other assets on the Balance Sheet. 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company recognizes revenue under Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606 , Revenue from Contracts with Customers .
The core principle of the new revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those
goods or services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle: 

Step
 1: Identify the contract with the customer 

Step
 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract 

Step
 3: Determine the transaction price 

Step
 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 

Step
 5: Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation 

Revenue
is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration
the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company generates revenue through staking rewards. 

The Company has entered into network-based
smart contracts by running its own crypto asset validator nodes (or nodes as well as by staking crypto assets on nodes
run by third-party operators (either directly or through crypto exchanges). Through these contracts, the Company provides cryptocurrency
to stake on a node for the purpose of validating transactions and adding blocks to a respective blockchain network. The term of a smart
contract can vary based on the rules of the respective blockchain and typically last a few weeks to months after it is canceled by the
operator and requires that the cryptocurrency staked remain locked up during the duration of the smart contract. In exchange for staking
the cryptocurrency and validating transactions on blockchain networks, the Company is entitled to all of the fixed cryptocurrency award
for running the Company s own node and is entitled to a fractional share of the fixed cryptocurrency award a third-party node operator
receives (less crypto asset transaction fees payable to the node operator or exchanges, which are immaterial and are recorded as a deduction
from revenue), for successfully validating or adding a block to the blockchain. The Company s fractional share of awards received
from delegating to a third-party validator node is based on the proportion of cryptocurrency the Company staked to the node to the total
cryptocurrency staked by delegators to the node. 

The
provision of validating blockchain transactions is an output of the Company s ordinary activities. Each separate block creation
or validation under a smart contract with a network represents a performance obligation. The transaction consideration the Company receives
 the cryptocurrency award is a non-cash consideration, which the Company measures at fair value on the date received.
The fair value of the cryptocurrency award received is determined using the quoted price of the related cryptocurrency on the date of
receipt. The satisfaction of the performance obligation for processing and validating blockchain transactions occurs at a point in time
when confirmation is received from the network indicating that the validation is complete, and the awards are available for transfer.
At that point, revenue is recognized. 

15 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation ASC 718 ). ASC
718 addresses all forms of share-based payment awards including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans
and stock incentive shares. Under ASC 718 awards result in a cost that is measured at fair value on the awards grant date, based
on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest and will result in a charge to operations. 

Share-based
payment awards exchanged for services are accounted for at the fair value of the award on the estimated grant date. 

Options 

Stock
options issued under the Company s long-term incentive plans are granted with an exercise price equal to no less than the market
price of the Company s stock at the date of grant and expire up to ten years from the date of grant. These options often vest over
a one-year period. 

The
Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the assumptions used in calculating
the fair value of stock-based awards represent management s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application
of management s judgment. 

Expected
Volatility - The Company uses historical volatility as it provides a reasonable estimate of the expected volatility. Historical volatility
is based on the most recent volatility of the stock price over a period of time equivalent to the expected term of the option. 

Risk-Free
Interest Rate - The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant
for the expected term of the option. 

Expected
Term - The Company s expected term represents the weighted-average period that the Company s stock options are expected
to be outstanding. The expected term is based on the expected time to post-vesting exercise of options by employees. The Company uses
historical exercise patterns of previously granted options to derive employee behavioral patterns used to forecast expected exercise
patterns. 

Expected
Dividend - The Company has not historically declared or paid any cash dividends on its common shares and does not plan to pay any
recurring cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and, therefore, uses an expected dividend yield of zero in its valuation models. 

Restricted
Stock Units (RSUs) 

For
awards vesting upon the achievement of a service condition, compensation cost measured on the grant date will be recognized on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period. Stock-based compensation expense for the market-based restricted stock units with explicit service conditions
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the longer of the derived service period or the explicit service period, regardless of whether
the market condition is satisfied. However, in the event that the explicit service period is not met, previously recognized compensation
cost would be reversed. Market-based restricted stock units subject to market-based performance targets require achievement of the performance
target as well as a service condition in order for these RSUs to vest. 

The
Company estimates the fair value of market-based RSUs as of the grant date and expected derived term using a Monte Carlo simulation that
incorporates pricing inputs covering the period from the grant date through the end of the derived service period. 

Expected
Volatility - The Company uses historical volatility as it provides a reasonable estimate of the expected volatility. Historical volatility
is based on the most recent volatility of the stock price over a period of time equivalent to the expected term of the RSUs. 

Risk-Free
Interest Rate - The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant
for the expected term of the RSUs. 

Expected
Term - The Company s expected term represents the weighted-average period that the Company s RSUs are expected to be
outstanding. The expected term is based on the stipulated 5-year period from the grant date until the market-based criteria are achieved.
If the market-based criteria are not achieved within the five-year period from the grant date, the RSUs will not vest and shall expire. 

Vesting
Hurdle Price - The vesting hurdle prices are determined by taking the vesting Market Cap criteria divided by the shares outstanding
as of the valuation dates. 

Effective
January 1, 2017, the Company elected to account for forfeited awards as they occur, as permitted by ASU 2016-09. Ultimately, the actual
expenses recognized over the vesting period will be for those shares that vested. Prior to making this election, the Company estimated
a forfeiture rate for awards at 0 , as the Company did not have a significant history of forfeitures. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

See
Note 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting standards and pronouncements. 

COVID-19 

The
COVID-19 pandemic has created significant national and global economic disruptions, which may adversely affect our business. However,
based on our current assessment, we do not expect any material impact on our long-term development, our operations, or our liquidity
due to the worldwide spread of COVID-19. We are actively monitoring this situation and the possible effects on its financial condition,
liquidity, operations, suppliers, and the industry. 

Inflation 

In
addition to the impacts of COVID-19, we have experienced, and are experiencing, the impact of domestic and global inflationary pressures
largely outside of our control. This inflationary pressure impacts our cost structure, leading to operational adjustments, and increasing
the cost of retaining talent and certain professional costs, despite our continued focus on controlling our costs where
possible. Management is unable to accurately predict when, or if, these national and global inflationary pressures will subside, or their
long-term impacts on our business and results of operations. We are actively monitoring the situation and assessing potential mitigation
strategies. 

16 

RISK
FACTORS 

There
are numerous and varied risks, known and unknown, that may prevent us from achieving our goals. If any of these risks actually occur,
our business, financial condition or results of operation may be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our
Common Stock could decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment. 

Summary
Risk Factors 

Our
business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that you should consider before investing in our common stock. Set forth below
is a summary of the principal risks we face: 

We
 have a limited operating history, particularly with respect to our developing blockchain infrastructure solutions business, Digital
 Asset Platform and staking-as-a -service operations. 

We
 have a history of operating losses and expect to continue to experience operating losses in future periods. 

We
 have an evolving business model which we may be unable to develop, adapt or execute effectively, and we may be unable to manage our
 growth or implement our business plan as intended or at all. 

We
 are highly dependent on our executive officers, particularly Charles Allen, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Michal
 Handerhan, our Chief Operating Officer, Michael Prevoznik, our Chief Financial Officer, and Manish Paranjape, our Chief Technology
 Officer, and the loss of the services of these individuals could materially harm our business. 

We
 may be subject to regulatory actions, private causes of actions such as intellectual property infringement claims, and restrictions
 and limited access to baking and financial services due to our operations in the cryptocurrency industry, and regulatory or other
 adverse developments in the cryptocurrency industry could otherwise adversely affect us. 

Because of our involvement in staking of crypto
assets through use of our Digital Asset Platform, we are subject to risks inherent in engaging in activities involving financial instruments
owned by third party users, notwithstanding the non-custodial nature of our platform or other features management believes to constitute
meaningful distinctions for regulatory, compliance and other purposes. 

A
 particular crypto asset s status as a security in any relevant jurisdiction is subject to a high degree of uncertainty,
 and if we are unable to correctly characterize a crypto asset, we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny, investigations, fines, sanctions,
 penalties and other adverse consequences, including potentially becoming subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940 which would
 impose significant regulatory burdens and compliance costs. 

Crypto assets and our related activities are characterized by numerous
other risks and uncertainties, including the possibility for adverse developments such as regulatory actions, bans or restrictions, declines
in the price of, demand for or public perception of crypto assets, theft, fraud, hacking, manipulation or malicious coding, price volatility,
the potential for one cryptocurrency to branch into two, variations among and the potential for adverse changes to blockchain algorithms,
and other external forces beyond our control described more fully below. 

The
 future development and growth of cryptocurrencies is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to predict and evaluate,
 and the market for the crypto assets we obtain and hold may not grow as we expect or the prices may decline, including due to political
 or economic crises or other factors which we neither predict nor control. 

The
 cryptocurrency space is subject to continuous regulatory uncertainty, and any adverse regulatory changes or other developments with
 respect to our operations or the crypto assets with which we transact may require us to alter our business model or suspend or cease
 some or all of our operations. 

Our
 focus on PoS blockchain networks exposes us to risk of loss due to features unique to those networks, including by virtue of being
 locked in by smart contracts such that we cannot liquidate a portion of the relevant crypto assets for a period of time during and
 after the staking process, during which the price or value of the crypto assets may depreciate. 

We
 are reliant on a single service provider for cloud computing infrastructure deployed in our blockchain infrastructure solutions business,
 and are therefore exposed to the risks which may arise from potential adverse developments that may be caused or experienced by such
 service provider. 

Our
 critical accounting policies may prove to be incorrect, we may need to implement additional finance and accounting systems, procedures
 and controls, and we face challenges inherent in operating a crypto assets business which is subject to evolving accounting treatment
 for which there is limited precedent. 

Our
stock price may be subject to significant volatility due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including its
potential connection to the price of one or more of the crypto assets with which we are or may become involved. 

17 

Risks
Related to Our Company in General 

We
have a limited operating history, particularly with respect to our new blockchain infrastructure operations which recently commenced
and our platform and staking-as-a-service business model, and we have a history of operating losses, and expect to incur significant
additional operating losses. 

We
have a limited operating history, and only recently commenced our new blockchain infrastructure operations in 2021. Further, we lack
an operating history with respect to our crypto asset analytics and staking-as-a-service platform s functions and operations.
In addition, the PoS blockchain networks on which our operations are centered are a relatively new and evolving means of validating
crypto asset transactions. Therefore, there is limited historical financial information upon which to base an evaluation of our
performance. Our prospects must be considered in light of the uncertainties, risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently
encountered by companies in their early stages of operations in general, and in the cryptocurrency industry in particular with
itself remains a relatively new space imbued with risk and uncertainty. We have generated net losses of 15.9 million and 16.0
million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect to incur additional net losses over the next several
years as we seek to expand operations. The amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve profitability are uncertain.
If we are unsuccessful at executing our business plan, our business, prospects, and results of operations may be materially
adversely affected. 

We
have an evolving business model which we may be unable to develop, adapt or execute effectively. 

As
crypto assets and blockchain technologies become more widely available, we expect the services and products associated with them to
evolve. In 2017, the SEC issued a DAO Report that promoters that use initial coin offerings or token sales to raise capital may be
engaged in the offer and sale of securities in violation of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
 Exchange Act ). More recently, the SEC has brought enforcement actions with respect to crypto assets and related
activities, including custodial staking-as-a-service models, as more particularly described later in these Risk Factors. These or
future developments may force or cause us to potentially change our future business in order to comply fully with the federal
securities laws as well as applicable state securities laws. As a result, to stay current with the industry, our business model may
need to evolve in the future as well. From time to time we may modify aspects of our business model relating to our product mix and
service offerings. For example, a main component of our current business objective is developing a comprehensive crypto asset
analytics and staking-as-a-service platform which enables users to perform or utilize a variety of functions related to crypto
assets, such as portfolio monitoring, and risk assessment all in one place in the hopes of attracting, maintaining and growing a
customer base in the long term. However, our investments into and efforts with respect to this goal may not come to fruition,
including due to adverse developments in regulatory, technological, competitive or other aspects that are beyond our control. We
cannot offer any assurance that our current business plan or any other modifications or undertakings with respect thereto will be
successful or will not result in harm to the business. In addition, we may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could
damage our reputation, limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results. If we are unable to effectively develop,
execute and adjust our business plan, or successfully manage our growth, you could lose some or all of your investment. 

The
loss of our executive officers could have a material adverse effect on us. 

Our success depends on the continued services of our executive officers
who have extensive technological and market knowledge and long-standing industry relationships. In particular, we have relied and will
continue to rely on Charles Allen, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Michal Handerhan, our Chief Operating Officer, Michael Prevoznik,
our Chief Financial Officer, and Manish Paranjape, our Chief Technology Officer, to continue and grow our operations and execute our business
plan. Our reputation among and our relationships with key cryptocurrency industry leaders are the direct result of a significant investment
of time and effort by these individuals to build our credibility in a highly specialized industry. The loss of services of any of our
executive officers could diminish our business and growth opportunities and our relationships with key leaders in the crypto asset industry
and could have a material adverse effect on us. 

Banks
and financial institutions may not provide banking services, or may cut off services, to businesses that engage in cryptocurrency-related
activities, and turmoil among financial institutions arising from or relating
to crypto assets or in general can materially adversely affect us and our industry. 

A
number of companies that engage in crypto asset and/or other cryptocurrency-related activities have been unable to find banks or financial
institutions that are willing to provide them with bank accounts and other services. Similarly, a number of companies and individuals
or businesses associated with cryptocurrencies may have had and may continue to have their existing bank accounts closed or services
discontinued with financial institutions in response to government action, particularly in China, where regulatory response to cryptocurrencies
has been to exclude their use for ordinary consumer transactions within China. More recent government action in the U.S. involving crypto
assets and related activities may cause this trend to expand in the U.S. We also may be unable to obtain or maintain these services for
our business. Many businesses that provide cryptocurrency-related activities may continue to have difficulties in finding banks and financial
institutions willing to provide them services which may decrease the usefulness of cryptocurrencies as a payment system and harm public
perception of cryptocurrencies, and could decrease their usefulness. 

Further,
in March 2023 two large financial institutions in the U.S., Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, which both serviced customers involved
with crypto assets, collapsed as continued negative economic prospects and failures to obtain payment from borrowers, together with a
large number of withdrawals, caused these banks to encounter substantial financial difficulty leading up to their failures. In response
to these events, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC transferred all the deposits, both insured and uninsured,
of these banks to corresponding bridge banks operated by the FDIC as it markets the institution to potential bidders. While
the impact of these developments on the Company and on the crypto asset industry and the economy in general remain unclear, it is possible
that these events underscore a broader financial crisis facing the country, in which crypto assets may have played and/or have yet to
play a role. In the wake of these collapses, the U.S. capital markets and the prices of equity securities and crypto assets have faced
significant volatility as investors continue to evaluate these events and how they may interact with other ongoing issues with the U.S.
economy, including inflation and Federal Reserve interest rate increases. 

The usefulness of cryptocurrencies
as a payment system and the public perception of cryptocurrencies could be damaged if banks or financial institutions were to close the
accounts of businesses engaging in cryptocurrency-related activities, which contingencies may become more likely
in the future if and to the extent crypto assets are considered a significant factor in the recent financial collapses experienced by
the major banks as described above. This could occur as a result of compliance risk, cost, government regulation or public pressure. The
risk applies to securities firms, clearance and settlement firms, national stock and derivatives on commodities exchanges, the over-the-counter
market, and the Depository Trust Company, which, if any of such entities adopts or implements similar policies, rules or regulations,
could negatively affect our relationships with financial institutions and impede our ability to convert cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies.
Such factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our strategy at all, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and harm investors.

A
particular crypto asset s status as a security in any relevant jurisdiction is subject to a high degree of uncertainty,
with a growing number of regulators taking the position that certain crypto assets are securities and bringing enforcement actions accordingly,
and if we are unable to properly characterize a crypto asset or comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject
to regulatory scrutiny, investigations, fines, and other penalties, which may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial
condition. 

The
SEC and its staff have taken the position that certain crypto assets fall within the definition of a security under the
U.S. federal securities laws. The legal test for determining whether any given crypto asset is a security is a highly complex, fact-driven
analysis that evolves over time, and the outcome is difficult to predict. The SEC generally does not provide advance guidance or confirmation
on the status of any particular crypto asset as a security. Furthermore, the SEC s views in this area have evolved over time, and
the SEC s Enforcement Division have recently demonstrated a willingness and intention to bring actions against businesses with
a crypto asset focus, including for failure to register transactions involving crypto assets under the federal securities laws by deeming
such crypto assets to be securities. For example, in February 2023 the SEC charged Kraken with failing to register the offer and sale
of its staking-as-a-service program, whereby investors transfer crypto assets to Kraken for staking in exchange for advertised annual
investment returns. Kraken settled this action by agreeing to cease its custodial staking business and to pay 30 million in disgorgement,
prejudgment interest and civil penalties. While there are material distinctions between Kraken s staking model and ours, including
the fact that we do not take custody of or exert control over the crypto assets that are staked using our platform, the SEC could disagree
with our assessment and seek to enforce the federal securities laws and regulations against our operations. Similarly, in March 2023
the New York Attorney General became the first U.S. regulator to claim in court that Ethereum, one of the major crypto assets which we
hold and stake, is a security in its lawsuit against KuCoin, a crypto asset exchange. If we become subject to regulatory scrutiny or
enforcement actions by securities regulators, it could result in expensive litigation and penalties and cessation of the allegedly noncompliant
operations, which would materially adversely harm us, including due to our recent shift of focus to our non-custodial staking-as-a-service
business and the costs and efforts deployed towards its development. These or additional developments that may arise underscore the risks
in our business, particularly its reliance on the use of crypto assets and staking of users crypto asset holdings. 

Further,
certain crypto assets may be deemed to be a security under the laws of some jurisdictions but not others. Various foreign
jurisdictions may, in the future, adopt additional laws, regulations, or directives that affect the characterization of crypto assets
as securities. As a result of the foregoing recent and potential developments, we may be forced to, or voluntarily elect
to, limit, suspend or cease our staking services operations or certain aspects thereof in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations
and avoid the regulatory scrutiny and adverse consequences that could result. Further, because of how recent these government actions
are and the high probability that further action is forthcoming, we anticipate higher compliance costs and diversion of management s
limited time and attention towards these events until a more definitive regulatory regime is established to govern the crypto asset industry
in which we operate. 

While
we do not currently, nor do we plan to, offer, sell, trade, and clear crypto assets or take custody of crypto assets as part of any potential
staking-as-a-service operations we may undertake, crypto assets we stake and validate transactions for could be deemed to be a security 
under applicable laws. This could be the case even if we conclude that our activities are compliant with these laws and regulations.
Our blockchain infrastructure operations which entails securing blockchains by validating blockchain transactions (most analogous to
Bitcoin mining) could be construed as facilitating transactions in crypto assets; as such we could be subject to legal or regulatory
action in the event the SEC, a foreign regulatory authority, or a court were to determine that a blockchain we secure is a security 
under applicable laws. Because our platform is not registered or licensed with the SEC or foreign authorities as a broker-dealer, national
securities exchange, or ATS (or foreign equivalents), and we do not seek to register or rely on an exemption from such registration or
license to secure blockchains. We recognize that the application of securities laws to the specific facts and circumstances of crypto
assets is a complex and often unpredictable process and subject to change, and staking and securing a blockchain, while similar to Bitcoin
mining, does not guarantee any conclusion under the U.S. federal securities laws, particularly given that each crypto asset and blockchain
network is unique. Therefore, if we do conclude that a particular crypto asset is not a security on advice of our legal counsel, and
the SEC or other government agencies or courts disagree with this assessment, we could be held liable for violation of securities laws.
In addition, new laws may be implemented that prevent or hinder us from operating in the manner we currently conduct our business or
plan to conduct our business, in which case our business may be materially harmed. 

Further,
if any crypto asset is deemed to be a security under any U.S. federal, state, or foreign jurisdiction, or in a proceeding in a court
of law or otherwise, it may have adverse consequences for such crypto asset. For instance, the networks on which such crypto assets are
utilized may be required to be regulated as securities intermediaries, and subject to applicable rules, which could effectively render
the network impracticable for its existing purposes. Further, it could draw negative publicity and a decline in the general acceptance
of the crypto asset. Also, such a development may make it difficult for such supported crypto asset to be traded, cleared, and custodied
as compared to other crypto assets that are not considered to be securities. These events could, among things, result in a decline in
the market prices for the crypto assets on which our operations rely, and thereby reduce the demand for our solutions and the revenue
generated therefrom.

Because
crypto assets may be determined to be Digital Securities, we may inadvertently violate the 1940 Act and incur large losses as a result
and potentially be required to register as an investment company. This would have a material adverse effect on an investment in us. 

We
plan to acquire a portfolio of crypto assets including Ethereum and other crypto assets. There is an increased regulatory
examination of crypto assets and Digital Securities. This has led to regulatory and enforcement activities. As described elsewhere
in these Risk Factors, the SEC and certain state regulators have recently begun to take a more definitive and aggressive stance
indicating that crypto assets and related activities, including custodial staking-based services, entail the offer and sale of
securities subject to applicable securities laws and regulations. We cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will
impact the treatment of Ethereum and other crypto assets, or our operations as they relate to such crypto assets or in
general, under the law. 

Under
the 1940 Act, a company may be deemed an investment company under if the value of its investment securities is more than 40 of its total
assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on a consolidated basis. Crypto assets we may own in the future may be determined
to be Digital Securities by the SEC or a court. Additionally, one or more states may conclude Ethereum, or other crypto assets
held by us in the future are securities under state securities laws which would require registration under state laws including merit
review laws. For example, California defines the term investment contract more strictly than the SEC. In addition, the
New York Attorney General has taken the position that Ethereum is a security under New York law, and if this position is upheld it could
significantly impact Ethereum and other crypto assets, as notwithstanding the decentralized nature of crypto assets, a substantially
large proportion of capital markets activities and the U.S. population are located in New York. 

Future
legislation, SEC rulemaking and other regulatory developments, including interpretations released by a regulatory authority, may impact
the manner in which Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto assets are treated for classification and clearing purposes. The SEC s
July 25, 2017 DAO Report expressed its view that crypto assets may be securities depending on the facts and circumstances, and recent
developments have confirmed that the SEC presently considers many if not most crypto assets to be securities. 

If
a crypto asset we hold were later determined to be a Digital Security, we could inadvertently become an investment company, as defined
by the 1940 Act, if the value of the Digital Securities we owned exceeded 40 of our assets excluding cash. We are subject to the following
risks: 

Contrary
 to legal advice, the SEC or a court may conclude that Ethereum, or other crypto assets we later acquire to be securities; 

based
 on legal advice, we may acquire other crypto assets which we have been advised are not securities but later are held to be securities;
 and 

we
 may knowingly acquire crypto assets that are securities and acquire minority investments in businesses which investments are securities. 

In
the event that the crypto assets held by us exceed 40 of our total assets, exclusive of cash, we may inadvertently become an investment
company. 

In
order to limit our acquisition of Digital Securities to stay within the 40 threshold, we will examine the manner in which a crypto asset
was initially marketed to determine if it may be deemed a Digital Security and subject to federal and state securities laws. Even if
we conclude that a particular crypto asset is not a security under the 1940 Act, certain states take a stricter view which means the
crypto asset may have violated applicable state securities laws. 

Should
the total value of securities which we hold exceed more than 40 of our assets (exclusive of cash) SEC Rule 3a-2 under the 1940 Act
allows an issuer to prevent itself from being deemed an investment company if it reduces its holdings of securities to less than 40 
of its assets (exclusive of cash) and does not go above the 40 threshold more than once every three years. Accordingly, if changes in
the classification of crypto assets causes us to exceed the 40 threshold, we may experience large losses when we liquidate Digital Securities
as a result of continued volatility. 

The
40 requirement may limit our ability to make certain investments or enter into joint ventures that could otherwise have a positive impact
on our earnings. In any event, we do not intend to become an investment company engaged in the business of investing and trading securities. 

To
the extent that crypto assets held by us are deemed by the SEC or a state legislator to fall within the definition of a security, we
may be required to register and comply with additional regulation under the Investment Company Act, including additional periodic reporting
and disclosure standards and requirements and the registration of our Company as an investment company. Such additional registrations:
i) would result in extraordinary, non-recurring expenses, ii) is time consuming and restrictive, iii) would require a restructuring of
our operations, and iv) we would be very constrained in the kind of business we could do as a registered investment company, thereby
materially and adversely impacting an investment in us. Further, if our examination of a crypto asset is incorrect, we may incur regulatory
penalties and private investor liabilities since Section 5 of the Securities Act is a strict liability statute much like selling spoiled
milk and state securities laws generally impose liability for negligence for misrepresentations. 

In
order to comply with the 1940 Act, we anticipate having increased management time and legal expenses in order to analyze which crypto
assets are securities and periodically analyze our total holdings to ensure that we do not maintain more than 40 of our total assets
(exclusive of cash) as securities. If our view that the crypto assets we hold are not securities is challenged by the SEC and courts
uphold the challenge, we may inadvertently violate the 1940 Act and incur substantial legal fees in defending our position. The cost
of such compliance would result in the Company incurring substantial additional expenses, and the failure to register if required would
have a materially adverse impact to conduct our operations. 

20 

Because
of the recent decline in the cryptocurrency market and other adverse developments and publicity surrounding the industry, our business
plans may not be successful and our business and financial condition may be adversely affected. 

Our
business is focused on the cryptocurrency industry, particularly blockchain infrastructure including our Digital Asset Platform. We also
hold and stake a number of crypto assets to generate revenue from the PoS systems on which they operate. The crypto asset industry is
characterized by a high level of volatility, and the collapse in the prices of most popular crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum
has cast doubt on the future of crypto asset-focused businesses such as ours. This trend was further impacted by the recent controversy
and failure surrounding FTX, a crypto asset exchange that collapsed after its Chief Executive Officer was accused of fraud and misappropriation
of corporate funds in a manner that has been compared to both Enron and Madoff. Since then certain other crypto asset-focused companies
have filed for bankruptcy, and more recently in March 2023 three major U.S. banks with involvement in crypto assets collapsed. The result
thus far has been a decline in the crypto assets markets and in the public s perception of the industry. In addition, following
the FTX controversy, regulators began reviewing crypto asset-focused companies and their operations with greater scrutiny, and have brought
enforcement actions seeking to restrict or cease such activities, such as the Kraken and KuCoin actions described above. While we believe
the non-custodial staking model we are pursuing for our platform presents distinctions from custodial methods of holding and controlling
crypto assets such as those that were employed by FTX and Kraken, holders of crypto assets, regulators, and other stakeholders may fail
to appreciate this distinction or to consider it sufficient to utilize our services or invest in our business. If we are unable to separate
ourselves from the recent adverse developments in the crypto asset space, or otherwise develop and execute on our business plan and blockchain
infrastructure in a manner that enables us to establish and maintain material revenue sources, our business and financial condition could
be materially adversely affected. Further, a perceived lack of stability in the crypto asset and the closure or suspension shutdown of
crypto asset exchanges and networks due to business failure, hackers or malware, government-mandated regulation, or fraud, may reduce
confidence in crypto asset networks and result in greater volatility in crypto asset values and on our results of operations. Further,
our focus on crypto assets, and the above-described past and/or any future adverse developments with respect to our operations or industry,
could result in declines or volatility in our stock price, difficulty or inability to obtain adequate financing as needed, on favorable
terms or at all, reduction in consumer demand for our platform and services, the risk of increased losses or asset impairments, and the
potential for legal proceedings and reputational harm which could arise from any of the foregoing. Such external developments have the
potential to affect us even if we believe our financial condition, operations and infrastructure our secure. These potential consequences
could materially adversely affect an investment in us. 

Events
in 2022 and more recently have increased the likelihood that U.S. federal and state legislatures and regulatory agencies will enact
laws and regulations to regulate crypto assets and crypto asset intermediaries, such as crypto exchanges and
custodians. 

The collapse of TerraUSD and
Luna and the bankruptcy filings of FTX and its subsidiaries, Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network, Voyager Digital, Genesis Global and
BlockFi have resulted in calls for heightened scrutiny and regulation of the crypto asset industry, with a specific focus on crypto asset
exchanges, platforms, and custodians. Federal and state legislatures and regulatory agencies are expected to introduce and enact new
laws and regulations to regulate crypto asset intermediaries, such as crypto asset exchanges and custodians. The March 2023 collapses
of Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Bank, and Signature Bank may amplify and/or accelerate these trends. The U.S. regulatory regime - namely the Federal
Reserve Board, U.S. Congress and certain U.S. agencies (e.g., the SEC, the CFTC, FinCEN, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation) as well as the White House have issued reports and
releases concerning crypto assets, including Bitcoin and crypto asset markets. Further, in 2023 the House of Representatives formed two
new subcommittees: the Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion Subcommittee and the Commodity Markets, Digital Assets, and
Rural Development Subcommittee, each of which were formed in part to analyze issues concerning crypto assets and demonstrate a legislative
intent to develop and consider the adoption of federal legislation designed to address the perceived need for regulation of and concerns
surrounding the crypto industry. However, the extent and content of any forthcoming laws and regulations are not yet ascertainable with
certainty, and it may not be ascertainable in the near future. A divided Congress makes any prediction difficult. Further the SEC seems
to have changed tactics and in early 2023 it sued multiple crypto asset companies for selling unregistered securities. We cannot predict
how these and other related events will affect us or the crypto asset business. We cannot assure you that future legislation or regulation
will not have an adverse effect upon us. It is possible that new laws and increased regulation and regulatory scrutiny may require the
Company to comply with certain regulatory regimes, which could result in new costs for the Company. The Company may have to devote increased
time and attention to regulatory matters, which could increase costs to the Company. New laws, regulations, and regulatory actions could
significantly restrict or eliminate the market for, or uses of, crypto assets including Ethereum, which could have a negative effect on
the value of Ethereum, which in turn would have a negative effect on the value of the Company s shares. 

Because
our staking business is dependent on the value of the crypto assets we stake to obtain blockchain rewards, and because those rewards
are paid out in the form of the blockchain s native crypto assets, the ongoing low market values and/or continued or long-term
declines in crypto asset prices will materially and adversely affect our results of operations. 

As
discussed above, the cryptocurrency market experienced a critical decline in 2022 which continues thus far in 2023. Prospects of a recovery
declined when the FTX controversy arose, as well as bankruptcies of other companies and projects in crypto asset and blockchain sector.
Our reliance on staking, which is expected to increase as we continue to seek to commercialize and improve upon our Digital Asset Platform
and non-custodial staking-as-a-service business, means that if the market values of the crypto assets we stake continues to decline or
remain at the relatively low levels they are currently, which appears possible given the adverse developments and wide scale sales of
and skepticism surrounding crypto assets that have resulted, the revenue we generate from staking will diminish. This is because the
rewards for staking a given crypto asset are paid out in more of that same crypto asset. Therefore, if the market price for the crypto
asset declines while staking is ongoing, unless the price later recovers the rewards we receive may not cover the decline in value of
the assets. If this trend continues, our operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected. 

21 

Our
business faces significant scaling obstacles due to its dependence on crypto assets and related infrastructure. 

Crypto
assets on which our current and planned operations depend face significant scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction
settlement times, and attempts to increase the volume of transactions may not be effective. Scaling of crypto assets is essential to
the widespread acceptance of crypto assets as a means of payment or other uses that stakeholders have in the past cited in demonstrating
interest in crypto assets. Many crypto asset networks, including those with which we are or may become involved in our operations, face
significant scaling challenges. For example, crypto assets are limited with respect to how many transactions can occur per second. Participants
in the crypto asset ecosystem debate potential approaches to increasing the average number of transactions per second that a network
can handle and have implemented mechanisms or are researching ways to increase scale, such as increasing the allowable sizes of blocks,
and therefore the number of transactions per block, and sharding (a horizontal partition of data in a database or search engine), which
would not require every single transaction to be included in every single validator s block. However, there is no guarantee that
any of the mechanisms in place or being explored for increasing the scale of settlement of crypto asset transactions will be effective. 

If
adoption of crypto assets as a means of payment or other uses does not occur on the schedule or scale anticipated or at all, the demand
for crypto assets may stagnate or decrease, which could adversely affect future prices of crypto assets we hold or otherwise rely upon
in our operations, and our results of operations and financial condition, which could have a material adverse effect on our business
or the market price for our securities. 

The
further development and acceptance of cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the issuance of and transactions in cryptocurrencies,
which represent a rapidly changing industry, are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. 

The
use of crypto assets to, among other things, buy and sell goods and services and complete transactions, is part of a new and rapidly
evolving industry that employs cryptocurrency assets based upon a computer-generated mathematical and/or cryptographic protocol. Large-scale
acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment has not, and may never, occur. The growth of the cryptocurrency industry in general,
and the use of crypto assets in particular, is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The factors affecting the further development
of the cryptocurrency industry, include but are not limited to: 

continued
 worldwide growth in the adoption and use of crypto assets as a medium of exchange; 

government
 and quasi-government regulation of crypto assets and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of the
 crypto assets systems; 

the
 maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of cryptocurrency networks; 

changes
 in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences; 

the
 availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, including new means of using fiat
 currencies and digital forms of fiat currencies; 

general
 economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to crypto assets; and 

the
 impact of regulators focusing on crypto assets and Digital Securities and the costs associated with such regulatory oversight. 

A
decline in the popularity or acceptance of the Ethereum Network or other blockchains networks we have exposure to could adversely affect
an investment in us. 

The
outcome of these factors could have negative effects on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our business strategy
at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations as well as potentially negative effect on
the value of any Ethereum or other crypto assets we hold or acquire, which would harm investors in our securities. 

22 

If
a malicious actor or botnet obtains control in excess of 50 of the processing power active on a cryptocurrency network, it is possible
that such actor or botnet could manipulate a blockchain in a manner that adversely affects an investment in us. 

If
a malicious actor or botnet (a volunteer or hacked collection of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions
of the computers) obtains a majority of the processing power or staked assets dedicated to either mining or staking a
cryptocurrency, it may be able to alter blockchains on which transactions of cryptocurrency reside and rely by constructing
fraudulent blocks or preventing certain transactions from completing in a timely manner, or at all. The malicious actor or botnet
could control, exclude or modify the ordering of transactions, though depending on blockchain may not generate new units or
transactions using such control. The malicious actor could double-spend its own cryptocurrency (i.e., spend the same
crypto asset in more than one transaction) and prevent the confirmation of other users transactions for as long as it
maintained control. To the extent that such malicious actor or botnet does not yield its control of the processing power or staked
assets on the network, or the cryptocurrency community does not reject the fraudulent blocks as malicious, reversing any changes
made to blockchains may not be possible. The foregoing description is not the only means by which the entirety of blockchains or
cryptocurrencies may be compromised but is only an example and may differ from blockchain to blockchain. 

The possible crossing of the 50 threshold indicates a greater risk that
a single validator could exert authority over the validation of network transactions. To the extent that a blockchain ecosystem including
other validators do not act to ensure greater decentralization of validator voting power, the feasibility of a malicious actor obtaining
control will increase because the botnet or malicious actor could compromise more than 50 voting power and thereby
gain control of blockchain, whereas if the blockchain remains decentralized it is inherently more difficult for the botnet of malicious
actor to aggregate enough voting power to gain control of the blockchain, may adversely affect an investment in our Common Stock. Such
lack of controls and responses to such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern
or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially
the value of any Ethereum or other crypto assets we acquire or hold, and harm investors. 

The
decentralized nature of crypto asset systems may lead to slow or inadequate responses to crises, which may negatively affect our business . 

The
decentralized nature of the governance of crypto asset systems may lead to ineffective decision making that slows development or prevents
a network from overcoming emergent obstacles. Governance of many crypto asset systems is by voluntary consensus and open competition
with no clear leadership structure or authority. To the extent lack of clarity in corporate governance of cryptocurrency systems leads
to ineffective decision making that slows development and growth of such crypto assets, the value of our Common Stock may be adversely
affected. 

Crypto
Exchanges are relatively new and therefore may be more exposed to fraud and failure than established, regulated exchanges for other products.
To the extent that large Crypto Exchanges representing a substantial portion of the crypto asset volume are involved in fraud or experience
security failures or other operational issues, such Exchanges failures may result in a reduction in the price of crypto assets
and adversely affect an investment in us. 

A
number of Crypto Exchanges have been closed due to fraud, failure or security breaches. In many of these instances, the customers of
such Exchanges were not compensated or made whole for the partial or complete losses of their account balances in such Exchanges. While
smaller Exchanges are less likely to have the infrastructure and capitalization that make larger Exchanges more stable, larger Exchanges
are more likely to be appealing targets for hackers and malware (i.e., software used or programmed by attackers to disrupt
computer operation, gather sensitive information or gain access to private computer systems). A lack of stability in an Exchange Market
and the closure or temporary shutdown of larger Crypto Exchanges due to fraud, business failure, hackers or malware, or government-mandated
regulation may reduce confidence in crypto assets overall and result in greater volatility in crypto asset values. These potential consequences
of an Exchange s failure could adversely affect an investment in us. 

There
is a lack of liquid markets, and possible manipulation of blockchain/cryptocurrency-based crypto assets. 

Crypto
assets that are represented and trade on a ledger-based platform may not necessarily benefit from viable trading markets. Stock exchanges
have listing requirements and vet issuers; requiring them to be subjected to rigorous listing standards and rules, and monitor investors
transacting on such platform for fraud and other improprieties. These conditions may not necessarily be replicated on a distributed ledger
platform, depending on the platform s controls and other policies. The laxer a distributed ledger platform is about vetting issuers
of cryptocurrency assets or users that transact on the platform, the higher the potential risk for fraud or the manipulation of the ledger
due to a control event. These factors may decrease liquidity or volume or may otherwise increase volatility or other assets trading on
a ledger-based system, which may adversely affect us. Such circumstances could adversely affect an investment in us. 

23 

Political
or economic crises may motivate large-scale sales of crypto assets, which could result in a reduction in crypto asset values and adversely
affect an investment in us. 

Geopolitical
or economic crises may motivate large-scale sales of crypto assets, which could rapidly decrease the price of crypto assets. For example,
market analysts have indicated that in some cases, such as during large scale adverse economic events, trading and market prices of cryptocurrencies
such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have correlated to some extent with the movement of equity markets, regardless of the stock or asset class.
For example, in March 2020, as global shutdowns ramped up in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other crypto assets plummeted together
with stock prices globally. Similarly, in 2022 as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to combat inflation, crypto asset prices
declined with stock prices in the U.S. These trends are contrary to a formerly commonly held conception that buying and holding crypto
assets can be used as a hedge to investing in the more conventional equity markets, and may eventually result in diminished
popularity of crypto assets in general by the public. Alternatively, as an emerging asset class with limited acceptance as a payment
system or commodity, global crises and general economic downturn may discourage investment in crypto assets as investors focus their
investment on less volatile asset classes as a means of hedging their investment risk. 

As
an alternative to fiat currencies that are backed by central governments, crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are relatively
new, are subject to supply and demand forces based upon the desirability of an alternative, decentralized means of buying and selling
goods and services, and it is unclear how such supply and demand will be impacted by geopolitical events. Nevertheless, political or
economic crises may motivate large-scale acquisitions or sales of crypto assets either globally or locally. Large-scale sales of crypto
assets would result in a reduction in crypto asset values and could adversely affect an investment in us. 

The
price of crypto assets may be affected by the sale of such crypto assets by other vehicles investing in crypto assets or tracking cryptocurrency
markets. 

The
global market for crypto assets is characterized by supply constraints that differ from those present in the markets for commodities
or other assets such as gold and silver. The mathematical protocols under which certain cryptocurrencies are mined or minted permit
the creation of a limited, predetermined amount of currency, while others have no limit established on total supply. To the extent
that other vehicles investing in crypto assets or tracking cryptocurrency markets form and come to represent a significant
proportion of the demand for crypto assets, large redemptions of the securities of those vehicles and the subsequent sale of crypto
assets by such vehicles could negatively affect crypto asset prices and therefore affect the value of our crypto assets. Such events
could have a material adverse affect on an investment in us. 

Current
interpretations require the regulation of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto assets under the CEA by the CFTC, we may be required to register
and comply with such regulations. To the extent that we decide to continue operations, the required registrations and regulatory compliance
steps may result in extraordinary, non-recurring expenses to us. We may also decide to cease certain operations. Any disruption of our
operations in response to the changed regulatory circumstances may be at a time that is disadvantageous to investors. 

Current
and future legislation, CFTC and other regulatory developments, including interpretations released by a regulatory authority, may impact
the manner in which Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto assets are treated for classification and clearing purposes. In particular, derivatives
on these assets are not excluded from the definition of commodity future by the CFTC. We cannot be certain as to how future
regulatory developments will impact the treatment of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto assets under the law. 

Bitcoin
and Ethereum have been deemed to fall within the definition of a commodity and, we may be required to register and comply with
additional regulation under the CEA, including additional periodic report and disclosure standards and requirements. Moreover, we
may be required to register as a commodity pool operator and to register us as a commodity pool with the CFTC through the National
Futures Association. Such additional registrations may result in extraordinary, non-recurring expenses, thereby materially and
adversely impacting an investment in us. If we determine not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration
requirements, we may seek to cease certain of our operations. Any such action may adversely affect an investment in us. 

24 

Our
interactions with a blockchain may expose us to SDN or blocked persons or cause us to violate provisions of law that did not contemplate
distribute ledger technology. 

The
Office of Financial Assets Control of the U.S. Department of Treasury requires us to comply with its sanction program and not conduct
business with persons named on its specially designated nationals SDN list. However, because of the pseudonymous nature
of blockchain transactions we may inadvertently and without our knowledge engage in transactions, to the extent validation constitutes
a transaction, with persons named on OFAC s SDN list. While we don t believe validation constitutes a transaction we can
provide no assurances regulators will agree with that view. Our Company s policy prohibits any transactions with such SDN individuals,
but we may not be adequately capable of determining the ultimate identity of the individual who delegate to our nodes. Additionally,
the U.S Department of Treasury recently has added sanctions that prevent U.S. persons from using cryptocurrencies to circumnavigate financial
sanctions placed on Russia. 

Because
our business requires us to download and retain one or more blockchains to effectuate our ongoing business, it is possible that such
digital ledgers contain prohibited depictions without our knowledge or consent. To the extent government enforcement authorities literally
enforce these and other laws and regulations that are impacted by decentralized distributed ledger technology, we may be subject to investigation,
administrative or court proceedings, and civil or criminal monetary fines and penalties, all of which could harm our reputation and affect
the value of our Common Stock. 

If
federal or state legislatures or agencies initiate or release tax determinations that change the classification of Bitcoin, Ethereum
or other crypto assets as property for tax purposes (in the context of when such crypto assets are held as an investment), such determination
could have a negative tax consequence on our Company or our shareholders. 

Current
IRS guidance indicates that crypto assets such as Ethereum should be treated and taxed as property, and that transactions involving the
payment of Ethereum for goods and services should be treated as barter transactions. While this treatment creates a potential tax reporting
requirement for any circumstance where the ownership of an Ethereum passes from one person to another, usually by means of Ethereum transactions
(including off-blockchain transactions), it preserves the right to apply capital gains treatment to those transactions which may have
adversely affect an investment in our Company. 

On
December 5, 2014, the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance issued guidance regarding the application of state tax law to
crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The agency determined that New York State would follow IRS guidance with respect to the treatment
of crypto assets for state income tax purposes. Furthermore, they defined crypto assets to be a form of intangible property, 
meaning the purchase and sale of crypto assets for fiat currency is not subject to state income tax (although transactions of crypto
assets for other goods and services maybe subject to sales tax under barter transaction treatment). It is unclear if other states will
follow the guidance of the IRS and the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance with respect to the treatment of crypto assets
for income tax and sales tax purposes. If a state adopts a different treatment, such treatment may have negative consequences including
the imposition of greater a greater tax burden on investors in crypto assets or imposing a greater cost on the acquisition and disposition
of crypto assets, generally; in either case potentially having a negative effect on prices in crypto assets and may adversely affect
an investment in our Company. 

Foreign
jurisdictions may also elect to treat crypto assets differently for tax purposes than the IRS or the New York State Department of Taxation
and Finance. To the extent that a foreign jurisdiction with a significant share of the market of crypto asset users imposes onerous tax
burdens crypto users, or imposes sales or value added tax on purchases and sales of crypto assets for fiat currency, such actions could
result in decreased demand for crypto assets in such jurisdiction, which could impact the price of crypto assets and negatively impact
an investment in our Company. 

We
may suffer losses due to staking, delegating, and other related services. 

Crypto
assets which utilize PoS consensus mechanisms enable holders to earn rewards by operating nodes and participating in decentralized governance,
bookkeeping and transaction confirmation activities on their underlying blockchain networks. We stake certain of our crypto assets and
operate nodes on blockchain networks through our blockchain infrastructure operations. Most PoS networks require crypto assets to be
transferred into smart contracts on the underlying blockchain networks not under our or anyone s control. If our validators, any
third-party service providers, or smart contracts fail to behave as expected, suffer cybersecurity attacks, experience security issues,
or encounter other problems, our crypto assets may be irretrievably lost. In addition, most PoS blockchain networks dictate requirements
for participation in the relevant decentralized governance activity, and may impose penalties, or slashing, if the relevant
activities are not performed correctly, such as if the node operator acts maliciously on the network, double signs any
transactions, or experience extended downtimes. Slashing penalties can apply due to prolonged inactivity on a blockchain network and
inadvertent errors such as computing or hardware issues, as well as more serious behavior such as intentional malfeasance. If we are
slashed by an underlying blockchain network, our crypto assets may be confiscated, withdrawn, or burnt by the network, resulting in permanent
losses. Any penalties or slashing events could damage our brand and reputation, cause us to suffer financial losses, and adversely impact
our business. 

25 

Our
blockchain infrastructure operations, including Company owned and run validator nodes on PoS blockchains, are subject to concentration
risk as they are consolidated on Amazon Web Services 

The
development and operation of the Company s validator nodes for non-custodial staking, as well as the development of the Digital
Asset Platform, is hosted on cloud computing by Amazon Web Services AWS ). The consolidation of our proprietary technology
on AWS subjects the Company to cyber security and other risks that face AWS. We have limited control over AWS, the services it provides
us and the safety and security measures related thereto. If AWS fails to maintain the continuous functionality or security of its networks
and related hardware on which we rely for our operations, we may be unable to generate revenue we otherwise would, and could suffer substantial
losses. For example, some PoS networks implement the slashing penalties described above, wherein the crypto assets that were staked to
allow us to participate in the validation process are taken away from us, if a validator node on which the crypto asset is staked is
offline for a certain amount of time. Additionally, if our Delegators crypto assets become subject to slashing, we could experience significant
losses, from resulting claims against us by them, as well as reputational harm and lost customer relationships. If any of the foregoing
or other adverse developments occur as a result of our reliance on a single service provider for our PoS validating operations, it could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Crypto
assets staked on Proof of Stake blockchains are locked in smart contracts and may not be accessible and liquid. 

Crypto
assets which utilize PoS consensus mechanisms are locked in smart contracts while staked which limits liquidity of the underlying crypto
asset. This is because under PoS network protocols, in order to participate in the staking process validators such as us are required
to enter into smart contracts which, among other things, require the validator to continue to keep a specified number of the crypto assets
owned by the validator locked-up in the network for a specified period of time before they can again be transferred
by such validator. This lock-up period often extends beyond the time at which the transaction is validated. We currently stake certain
of our crypto assets and operate nodes on blockchain networks through our blockchain infrastructure services business. During times of
high volatility or downturns, which are common among crypto assets for many reasons including those described elsewhere in these Risk
Factors, we may be unable to liquidate certain crypto assets to the extent desired. We currently carry our staked Ethereum as a non-current
long-term asset on our balance sheet until liquidity for staked Ethereum is unlocked. Staked crypto assets which can be unlocked from
a smart contract in less than one year are carried as current assets on our balance sheet. As such we may experience large losses when
and if we are able to liquidate our crypto assets as a result of continued volatility, further if we are unable to liquidate our crypto
assets we could suffer material financial losses, which would adversely impact our business. 

Because
our current business plan and operations depend on consumers investing in crypto assets and staking and monitoring them using our
non-custodial platform, economic downturns will materially adversely affect us. 

Our
non-custodial staking-as-a-service platform depends on consumers purchasing crypto assets from exchanges and holdings them long-term,
and staking them using our platform, as well as using the other functions offered by or envisioned for our platform such as data analytics
and monitoring crypto asset holdings. Therefore, economic downturns or a recession will cause a reduction in demand for our platform
by causing consumers to reduce spending on investments or non-essential items such as crypto assets. Similarly, a decline in the popularity
or public perception of such crypto assets would yield a similar result. In 2022, the U.S. capital markets in general, and crypto assets
prices in particular, saw significant declines as the Federal Reserve heightened interest rates to combat inflation. This followed initial
declines earlier in 2022 in response to the Ukraine war and worsening supply chain issues and supply shortages. As of the date of this
Report, the U.S. capital markets remain subject to substantial uncertainty, with consumer confidence declining due to a number of factors
including, as a result of the collapse of three major banks in March 2023 and the potential broader implications and financial impact
on the U.S. economy, as well as high inflation and anticipated continued interest rate increases and the enhanced likelihood of a recession
as a result. Give these current market conditions, consumers may elect to sell their crypto assets, or decline to increase their holdings,
rather than hold and stake them using our platform. Because we and our industry depend on consumers holding and staking the crypto assets
long-term, this trend has the potential to materially adversely harm us and our prospects. Particularly in the event of prolonged or
recurring recessionary conditions. 

26 

Our
obligations to comply with the laws, rules, regulations, and policies of a variety of jurisdictions is uncertain and untested, and we
are subject to uncertainty with respect to our potential non-custodial staking-as-a-service business and we may be subject to investigations
and enforcement actions by U.S. and non-U.S. regulators and governmental authorities. 

In
addition to the securities laws and regulations discussed elsewhere in these Risk Factors, laws regulating financial services, the internet,
mobile technologies, digital, and related technologies inside and outside of the U.S. may impose obligations on us, as well as broader
liability. For example, we are required to comply with laws and regulations related to sanctions and export controls enforced by U.S.
Department of Treasury s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, and U.S. anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing
laws and regulations, enforced by FinCEN and certain state financial services regulators. U.S. sanctions laws and regulations generally
restrict dealings by persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction with certain governments, countries, or territories that are the target of
comprehensive sanctions, currently the Crimea Region of Ukraine, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Venezuela as well as with persons
identified on certain prohibited lists. In May 2019, FinCEN issued guidance on the application of FinCEN regulations to certain business
models. While the guidance directly addressed Bitcoin mining, it did not address securing PoS blockchains which while similar to Bitcoin
mining has technical nuanced differences which could potentially alter the analysis. As such, there can be no guarantee that securing
(mining) on PoS blockchain networks will be viewed as compliant, notwithstanding the May 2019 FinCEN guidance. In particular, the nature
of blockchains make it technically impossible in all circumstances to prevent or identify transactions with particular persons or addresses.
While our platform, StakeSeeker, utilizes geo-blocking in an effort to prevent its use by persons located in sanctioned jurisdictions,
if notwithstanding these efforts our current or planned activities are found to constitute facilitating or assisting the
actions of non-U.S. persons that would be prohibited for U.S. persons to perform directly due to U.S. sanctions, despite the fact we
don t take custody of staked crypto assets nor pay delegator crypto rewards, it could result in material negative consequences
for us, including costs related to government investigations, harsh financial penalties, and harm to our reputation. The impact on us
related to these matters could be substantial. We are seeking legal guidance on what, if any, controls and procedures need to be put
in place and whether our activities could constitute facilitation of any illicit activities under the current regulatory framework. 

Regulators
worldwide frequently study each other s approaches to the regulation of the digital economy. Consequently, developments in any
jurisdiction may influence other jurisdictions. New developments in one jurisdiction may be extended to additional services and other
jurisdictions. In addition, digital economies themselves are subject to rapid and unpredictable change that regulators could decide warrants
updates or additions to existing regulatory regimes. As a result, the risks created by any new law or regulation in one jurisdiction
are magnified by the potential that they may be replicated, affecting our business in another place. Conversely, if regulations diverge
worldwide, we may face difficulty adjusting aspects of our business. 

The
complexity of U.S. federal and state and international regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the evolving global regulatory
environment, could result in a single event prompting a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings
by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, harm our
reputation, damage our brands and business, and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Due to the uncertain
application of existing laws and regulations, it may be that, despite our planned regulatory and legal analysis that certain products
and services are currently unregulated, such products or services may indeed be subject to financial regulation, licensing, or authorization
obligations that we have not obtained or with which we have not complied. As a result, we are at a heightened risk of enforcement action,
litigation, regulatory, and legal scrutiny which could lead to sanctions, cease, and desist orders, or other penalties and censures which
could significantly and adversely affect our continued operations and financial condition. 

Security
Risks Related to Our Crypto Asset Holdings 

Our
crypto assets may be subject to loss, damage, theft or restriction on access. 

There
is a risk that part or all of our crypto assets could be lost, stolen, destroyed or become inaccessible. We believe that our crypto
assets will be an appealing target to hackers or malware distributors seeking to destroy, damage or steal our crypto assets. To
minimize the risk of loss, damage and theft, security breaches, and unauthorized access we primarily hold our crypto assets in
various cryptocurrency digital wallets and hold minimal amounts at exchanges. Nevertheless, the digital wallets and exchanges we
utilize may not be impenetrable and may not be free from defect or immune to acts of God, and any loss due to a security breach,
software defect or act of God will be borne by us. Any of these events may adversely affect our operations and, consequently, an
investment in us. 

27 

To
the extent that any of our crypto assets are held by crypto exchanges, we may face heightened risks from cybersecurity attacks and financial
stability of the exchanges. 

All crypto assets not held in a Company s controlled digital wallet
are held at crypto exchanges and subject to the risks encountered by those exchange including DDoS Attacks, other malicious hacking,
a sale of the exchange, loss of the crypto assets by the exchange, security breaches, and unauthorized access of our account by hackers.
The Company may not maintain a custodian agreement with the exchanges with which it holds its crypto assets at. exchanges do not provide
insurance and may lack the resources to protect against hacking and theft. Less than 0.1 of the Company s crypto assets are typically
stored at exchanges, however, this may increase at or around the sales or purchase of crypto assets. We may be materially and adversely
affected if the exchanges suffer cyberattacks or incur financial problems. 

The
loss or destruction of a private key required to access a crypto asset may be irreversible. Our loss of access to our private keys
could adversely affect an investment in our Company. 

Crypto
assets are controllable only by the possessor of both the unique public key and private key relating to the local or online digital wallet
in which the crypto assets are held. We are required by the operation of the crypto asset network to publish the public key relating
to a digital wallet in use by us when it first verifies a spending transaction from that digital wallet and disseminates such information
into the network. We safeguard and keep private the private keys relating to our crypto assets not held at exchanges by utilizing key
sharing and multi-signature storage techniques; to the extent a private key is lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised and no backup
of the private key is accessible, we will be unable to access the crypto assets held by it and the private key will not be capable of
being restored by the network. Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to store our crypto assets could adversely affect
an investment in us. 

Security
threats to us could result in a loss of Company s crypto assets. 

Any
security breach caused by hacking, which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional
malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer
viruses, could harm our business operations or result in loss of our Ethereum and other crypto assets. Any breach of our infrastructure
could result in damage to our reputation which could adversely affect an investment in us. Furthermore, we believe that, as our assets
continue to grow, it may become a more appealing target for security threats such as hackers and malware. 

The
security system and operational infrastructure may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, error or malfeasance of an employee
of ours, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our, private keys, data or Ethereum. Additionally,
outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees of ours to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our
infrastructure. As the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently,
or may be designed to remain dormant until a predetermined event and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may
be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security
system occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security system could be harmed, which could adversely affect an investment
in us. In the event of a security breach, we may be forced to cease operations, or suffer a reduction in assets, the occurrence of each
of which could adversely affect an investment in us. 

Incorrect
or fraudulent crypto asset transactions may be irreversible. 

Crypto
asset transactions are not, from an administrative perspective, reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient
of the transaction. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to a blockchain, an incorrect transfer
of crypto assets or a theft of crypto assets generally will not be reversible, and we may not be capable of seeking compensation for
any such transfer or theft. It is possible that, through computer or human error, or through theft or criminal action, our crypto assets
could be transferred from us in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties. To the extent that we are unable to seek a corrective
transaction with such third party or are incapable of identifying the third party which has received our crypto assets through error
or theft, we will be unable to revert or otherwise recover incorrectly transferred crypto assets. To the extent that we are unable to
seek redress for such error or theft, such loss could adversely affect an investment in us. 

The
limited rights of legal recourse against us, and our lack of insurance protection expose us and our shareholders to the risk of loss
of our crypto assets for which no person is liable. 

The
crypto assets held by us are not insured. Therefore, a loss may be suffered with respect to our crypto assets which are not covered by
insurance and for which no person is liable in damages which could adversely affect our operations and, consequently, an investment in
us. 

Crypto
assets held by us are not subject to FDIC or SIPC protections. 

We
do not and will not hold our Ethereum and other crypto assets with a banking institution or a member of the FDIC or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation SIPC and, therefore, our crypto assets
are not subject to the protections enjoyed by depositors with FDIC or SIPC member institutions. 

28 

Risks
Related to Our Digital Asset Platform (StakeSeeker) Development 

There
is substantial doubt that we will be able to fully develop or commercialize our Digital Asset Platform. 

We
are continuing to develop our Digital Asset Platform with the ultimate goal of consolidating users information so that it can
be more easily accessed and reviewed by users. We may not successfully fully develop this platform as planned, in a cost-efficient manner,
to the extent sought or at all. If we fail to develop a Digital Asset Platform as intended, it could have a material adverse effect on
our business, especially to the extent that we allocate significant capital, labor and other resources to this endeavor rather than focusing
on other business opportunities which may prove to have been more lucrative in hindsight. 

Even
if we do successfully develop our platform and bring it to the marketplace, there is no guarantee that we will attract enough users to
generate revenue or become profitable. Our competitors, most of whom have greater capital and human resources than we do, may develop
technologies that are superior to our platform or commercialize comparable technologies before us, in which case our ability to attract
users and generate revenue therefrom could be rendered unlikely or even impossible. If we fail to obtain users for our platform or find
an alternative means of commercializing our platform to recoup our investment therein, it will have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition. Finally, even if we do fully develop the platform and attract users, events outside of our control such as regulatory
actions against us or crypto assets on which our platform depend, or economic downturns, could force us to cease operating our platform
or render it obsolete. If we fail to fully develop and commercialize our platform in a timely and effective manner, your investment in
us could lose some or all of its value. 

Even
if we develop and commercialize our Digital Asset Platform, we may not be able to generate material revenues. 

The
Digital Asset Platform that we are currently developing will require significant time and capital. Even if we do develop this platform
and acquire a sufficient number of users to generate revenue, we cannot guarantee the revenue would be material or sufficient to justify
the costs we anticipate incurring to develop the platform. Our ability to capitalize on any platform we do develop will depend on a variety
of factors and uncertainties beyond our control, including the competition we face and similar or superior services that may already
exist by the time we begin marketing our platform, the volatile nature of the blockchain industry generally and the unknown demand for
the services we plan to offer through our platform as it is currently envisioned, regulatory developments that have arisen or may arise
in the future, and the advancement of new technologies which could arise in the future and render our platform partially or completely
obsolete. If any of these or other risks come to fruition to prevent our platform from generating material revenue to justify its costs
of production, it would have a material adverse effect on our business. 

The
development of our Digital Asset Platform will depend on the successful efforts of our employees. 

Our
platform development effort is completely dependent on our infrastructure. We use internally developed systems for the platform. Any
future difficulties developing aspects of our platform may cause delays in bringing our platform to market. If our data stored on AWS
and the backups thereof are compromised, our platform, prospects, could be harmed. Despite our implementation of network security measures,
our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, the occurrence of any of which
could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data or the inability to launch our platform. The occurrence of any of the foregoing
risks could materially harm our business. 

We
are subject to cyber security risks and may incur delays in platform development in an effort to minimize those risks and to respond
to cyber incidents. 

Our
Digital Asset Platform is and will continue to be dependent on the secure operation of our website and systems as well as the operation
of the Internet generally. The platform involves reading user data, and storage of user data, and security breaches could expose us to
a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. A number of large Internet companies have suffered
security breaches, some of which have involved intentional attacks. From time to time, we and many other internet businesses also may
be subject to a denial of service attacks wherein attackers attempt to block customers access to our website. If we are unable
to avert a denial of service attack for any significant period, we could sustain delays in the development of the platform and when launched
risk losing future users and have user dissatisfaction. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent
rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks may target us, our users, or exchanges we read data from in general or the communication
infrastructure on which we depend. If an actual or perceived attack or breach of our security occurs, user perception of the effectiveness
of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose our future user. Actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur
increasing costs, and delay development. A person who is able to circumvent our security measures might be able to misappropriate our
or our users proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise
damage our reputation and platform. Any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws,
significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm
our business. 

29 

We
may become subject to data privacy and data security laws and regulations by virtue of our Digital Asset Platform, which could force
us to incur significant compliance costs and expose us to liabilities. 

By
virtue of our platform, including planned additional functions, we may become subject to the various local, state, federal, and international
laws and regulations that apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and processing of personal data.
These data protection and privacy laws and regulations and their applicability to our current and future operations and offerings are
subject to uncertainty and continue to evolve in ways that could adversely impact our business. These laws could have a substantial impact
on our operations, depending in large part on the location of our operations, users, employees and other stakeholders with which we are
or become involved. 

In
the United States, state and federal lawmakers and regulatory authorities have increased their attention on the collection and use of
user data. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which became effective in 2020. The CCPA requires
covered companies to, among other things, provide new disclosures to California users, and affords such users new privacy rights such
as the ability to opt-out of certain sales of personal information and expanded rights to access and require deletion of their personal
information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is
collected, used, and shared. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for security
breaches that may increase security breach litigation. Potential uncertainty surrounding the CCPA may increase our compliance costs and
potential liability, particularly in the event of a data breach, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, including
how we use personal information, our financial condition, the results of our operations or prospects. Since the CCPA was enacted, other
states including Nevada, Maine, Colorado and Virginia have enacted similar legislation designed to protect the personal information of
consumers and penalize companies that fail to comply, and other states have also proposed similar legislation. The costs of compliance
with, and other burdens imposed by, the CCPA, and similar laws may limit our prospective customer base or the use and adoption of our
products and services and/or require us to incur substantial compliance costs, which could have an adverse impact on our business. Additionally,
many foreign countries and governmental bodies in which our users may reside, have laws and regulations concerning the collection, use,
processing, storage, and deletion of personal information obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdiction.
These laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States. Such laws and regulations may require companies
to implement new privacy and security policies, permit individuals to access, correct, and delete personal information stored or maintained
by such companies, inform individuals of security breaches that affect their personal information, require that certain types of data
be retained on local servers within these jurisdictions, and, in some cases, obtain individuals affirmative opt-in consent to
collect and use personal information for certain purposes. 

There
is a risk that as we develop and offer our platform and other services, we may become subject to one or more of these data privacy
and security laws. Despite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to privacy, data
protection, and information security, including by deploying geo-blocking features to limit the jurisdictions from which our
platform can be accessed, it is possible that our practices, offerings, or platform, or third parties on which we rely, could fail.
For instance, the overall regulatory framework governing the application of privacy laws to blockchain technology is still highly
undeveloped and likely to evolve. Our failure, or the failure by our third-party providers or partners, to comply with applicable
laws or regulations and to prevent unauthorized access to, or use or release of personal data, or the perception that any of the
foregoing types of failure has occurred, even if unfounded, could subject us to audits, inquiries, whistleblower complaints, adverse
media coverage, investigations, potential severe criminal or civil sanctions, fines or damages, reputational harm, or expensive and
time-consuming proceedings by governmental agencies and private claims and litigation, any of which could materially adversely
affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. 

We
may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may prevent or delay our product development efforts and stop us from
commercializing or increase the costs of commercializing the Digital Asset Platform. 

Our
commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other intellectual property rights
of third parties however, we may not always be able to determine that we are using or accessing protected information or software. For
example, there could be issued patents of which we are not aware that our products infringe. There also could be patents that we believe
we do not infringe, but that we may ultimately be found to infringe. Moreover, patent applications are in some cases maintained in secrecy
until patents are issued. The publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than
the date on which the underlying discoveries were made and patent applications were filed. Because patents can take many years to issue,
there may be currently pending applications of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that our products infringe. 

Because
of the foregoing, we may be subject to legal claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties. We
expect this risk to increase as we continue to develop and roll-out additional functions in our Digital Asset Platform and potential
StaaS operations in the future. The ready availability of damages, royalties and the potential for injunctive relief has increased the
defense litigation costs of patent infringement claims, especially those asserted by third parties whose sole or primary business is
to assert such claims. Such claims, even if not meritorious, may result in significant expenditure of financial and managerial resources,
and the payment of damages or settlement amounts. 

Accordingly,
we could expend significant resources defending against patent infringement and other intellectual property right claims; which could
require us to divert resources away from operations. Any damages we are required to pay or injunctions against our continued use of such
intellectual property in resolution of such claims may cause a material adverse effect to our business and operations, which could adversely
affect the trading price of our securities and harm our investors. Additionally, we may become subject to injunctions prohibiting us
from using software or business processes we currently use or may need to use in the future or requiring us to obtain licenses from third
parties when such licenses may not be available on financially feasible terms or terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, we may
not be able to obtain on favorable terms, or at all, licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own in
providing ecommerce services to other businesses and individuals under commercial agreements.

Risks
Related to Our Public Company Reporting Requirements and Accounting Matters 

We
may need to implement additional finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls as we grow our business and organization and
to satisfy new reporting requirements . 

We
are required to comply with a variety of reporting, accounting and other rules and regulations. Compliance with existing requirements
is expensive. We may need to implement additional finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls to satisfy our reporting requirements
and such further requirements may increase our costs and require additional management time and resources. For example, many crypto assets,
including those on PoS blockchain networks with which we are or may become involved, demonstrate novel and unique accounting challenges,
including due to smart contracts affecting the underlying crypto assets. Any deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting,
should they arise, could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, negatively affect the market price
of our Common Stock, subject us to regulatory investigations and penalties, and adversely impact our business and financial condition. 

Changes
in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could
significantly affect our financial results . 

Generally
accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a
wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including but not limited to revenue recognition, estimating valuation allowances
and accrued liabilities (including allowances for returns, credit card chargebacks, doubtful accounts and obsolete and damaged inventory),
internal use software and website development (acquired and developed internally), accounting for income taxes, valuation of long-lived
and intangible assets and goodwill, stock-based compensation and loss contingencies, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions,
estimates and judgments by our management. Additional complexities can arise with respect to crypto asset operations. Changes in these
rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change
our reported or expected financial performance. 

Since
there has been limited precedence set for financial accounting of crypto assets, it is unclear how we will
be required to account for crypto asset transactions in the future. 

Since
there has been limited precedence set for the financial accounting of crypto assets, it is unclear how
we will be required to account for crypto asset transactions or assets. Furthermore, a change in regulatory or financial accounting standards
could result in the necessity to restate our financial statements as has happened in the past. Such a restatement could negatively impact
our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operation. 

If
our estimates or judgment relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely
affected. 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates
on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the
section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of these estimates form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Significant estimates and judgments involve the identification of performance obligations in revenue recognition,
evaluation of tax positions, and the valuation of stock-based awards and crypto assets we hold, among others. Our operating results may
be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our
operating results to fall below the expectations of analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our Common
Stock. 

We
are subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Exchange Act), and other federal securities laws, including compliance
with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ). 

The
costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to shareholders
will cause our expenses to be higher than they would have been if we were privately held. It may be time-consuming, difficult and costly
for us to develop, implement and maintain the internal controls and reporting procedures required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may need
to hire additional financial reporting, internal controls and other finance personnel in order to develop and implement appropriate internal
controls and reporting procedures. 

Public
company compliance may make it more difficult to attract and retain officers and directors. 

The
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules implemented by the SEC have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. As a
public company, we expect these rules and regulations to increase our compliance costs and make certain activities more time-consuming
and costly. The impact of the SEC s July 25, 2017 report on Digital Securities (the DAO Report as well as enforcement
actions and speeches made by the SEC s Chairman will increase our compliance and legal costs. As a public company, we also expect
that these rules and regulations will make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance
in the future and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same
or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board or as
executive officers, and to maintain insurance at reasonable rates, or at all.

Risks
Related to our Common Stock 

Our
stock price may be volatile. 

The
market price of our Common Stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors,
many of which are beyond our control, including the following: 

changes
 in our industry including changes which adversely affect crypto assets; 

adverse
 regulatory developments such as the recent actions brought by securities regulators on crypto assets activities; 

public
 announcements and corporate events; 

continued
 volatility in the price of crypto assets; 

our
 ability to obtain working capital financing; 

sales
 of our securities or those of other companies, or of crypto assets, due to external forces such as geopolitical turmoil, inflation,
 federal interest rate adjustments or other events; 

additions
 or departures of key personnel including our executive officers; 

sales
 of our Common Stock; 

exercise
 of our warrants and the subsequent sale of the underlying Common Stock; 

conversion
 of our convertible notes and the subsequent sale of the underlying Common Stock; 

our
 ability to execute our business plan; 

operating
 results that fall below expectations; 

loss
 of any strategic relationship; and 

economic
 and other external factors. 

In
addition, the securities markets have from time-to-time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the
operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of
our Common Stock. As a result, you may be unable to resell your shares at a desired price. 

While
we paid a cash dividend in 2022, and declared a Series V Convertible Preferred stock Series V dividend in 2023, we
do not expect to pay regular or recurring dividends in the future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our
Common Stock. 

While
we declared and paid a cash dividend (which came with the option to be paid in Bitcoin if elected by the shareholder) payable to
holders of our Common Stock as of March 17, 2022, and recently declared a planned Series V dividend distribution to shareholders of
our Common Stock of record as of March 27, 2023, which has since been delayed due to anticipated changes to the structure, as described elsewhere in this Report, we do not anticipate paying dividends on a
regular or recurring basis for the foreseeable future. For information on the risks and uncertainties inherent in the Series V
dividend, see the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 31, 2023 disclosing certain risks and uncertainties
and other information about the dividend including but not limited to the payment of the Series V dividend. 

Any
future payment of dividends on our Common Stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors
affecting us at such time as our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our Common Stock may be less valuable
because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates. 

Our
articles of incorporation allow for our Board to create new series of preferred stock without further approval by our shareholders, which
could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our Common Stock. 

Our
Board has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. Our Board also has the authority
to issue preferred stock without further shareholder approval. For example, our Board approved the Series V in the first
quarter of 2023. As a result, our Board could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred
right to our assets upon liquidation, provide holders of the preferred anti-dilution protection, the right to receive dividend payments
before dividends are distributed to the holders of Common Stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium,
prior to the redemption of our Common Stock. In addition, our Board could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that
has greater voting power than our Common Stock or that is convertible into our Common Stock, which could decrease the relative voting
power of our Common Stock or result in dilution to our existing shareholders. 

Substantial
future sales of our Common Stock by us or by our existing shareholders could cause our stock price to fall. 

Additional
equity financings (in addition to the shares issued under the ATM Agreement) or other share issuances by us, including shares issued
in connection with strategic alliances and corporate partnering transactions, could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. Sales by existing shareholders of a large number of shares of our Common
Stock in the public market or the perception that additional sales could occur could cause the market price of our Common Stock to drop.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of
the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December
31, 2022. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent
limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined effective could provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation. 

Our
management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based
on the framework in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework ). Based on our evaluation under the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated
Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act that
occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

 BTCS Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of BTCS Inc. (The Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the related
statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December
31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

F- 1 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Going
Concern 

As
described further in Note 9 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and does not have
an established source of revenues sufficient to cover all of its operating costs. The ability of the Company to ultimately continue as
a going concern is dependent on executing business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. The Company s cash position
and liquid Digital Assets are sufficient to support its daily operations over the next twelve months based on the cash flow forecasts
provided by management. The cash used in operations in 2022 was approximately 800,000. 

At
December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 1.8 million of liquid Digital Assets (i.e. non-staked) and 2.1 million of cash. During
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company sold a total of 2,172,336 shares of Common Stock under the ATM Agreement for aggregate
total net proceeds of approximately 11,126,331. The Company s cash position and liquid Digital Assets are sufficient to support
its daily operations over the next twelve months. Accordingly, the Company has determined that these factors alleviate the doubt as to
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements.
Management may to continue to fund its business by way of public or private offerings of the Company s stock or through loans from
private investors, in order satisfy the Company s business objective for at least one year from the financial statement issuance
date. However, the Company has concluded that these plans alleviate the doubt related to its ability to continue as a going concern. 

We
determined the Company s ability to continue as a going concern is a critical audit matter due to the estimation and uncertainty
regarding the Company s available capital and the risk of bias in management s judgments and assumptions in their determination.
Our audit procedures related to the Company s assertion on its ability to continue as a going concern included the following, among
others: 

We assessed whether the
 Company s determination that their alleviation of doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern was adequately disclosed. 

We reviewed and evaluated
 management s plans including cash flow projections for alleviating the doubt about going concern.

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may

Income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability
approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that
have been recognized in the Company s financial statements or tax returns. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred
tax assets if all, or some portion, of such assets will more than likely not be realized. Should they occur, the Company s policy
is to classify interest and penalties related to tax positions as income tax expense. Since the Company s inception, no such interest
or penalties have been incurred.

Restricted
Stock Units (RSUs) 

For
awards vesting upon the achievement of a service condition, compensation cost measured on the grant date will be recognized on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period. Stock-based compensation expense for the market-based restricted stock units with explicit service conditions
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the longer of the derived service period or the explicit service period, regardless of whether
the market condition is satisfied. However, in the event that the explicit service period is not met, previously recognized compensation
cost would be reversed. Market-based restricted stock units subject to market-based performance targets require achievement of the performance
target as well as a service condition in order for these RSUs to vest. 

The
Company estimates the fair value of market-based RSUs as of the grant date and expected derived term using a Monte Carlo simulation that
incorporates pricing inputs covering the period from the grant date through the end of the derived service period.

earnings and profits. The return of capital distribution reduces the Company s additional paid in capital balance. The Company
will evaluate the appropriateness of potential future dividends as the Company continues to grow its operations. Dividend distributions

Level
3 Valuation Techniques 

Level
3 financial assets consist of private equity investments for which there is no current public market for these securities such that the
determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s Level 3 investments
were carried at original cost of the investments, with a value of .
The Company has elected to apply the measurement alternative under ASC 321, Investments Equity Securities , for these investments. 

Level
3 financial liabilities consist of the warrant liabilities for which there is no current market for these securities such that the determination
of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. 

Changes
in fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are analyzed each period based on changes in estimates
or assumptions and recorded as appropriate. 

A
significant decrease in the volatility or a significant decrease in the Company s stock price, in isolation, would result in a
significantly lower fair value measurement. Changes in the values of the warrant liabilities are recorded in change in fair value
of warrant liabilities in the Company s statements of operations. 

On
March 2, 2021, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the Offering with certain purchasers pursuant
to which the Company agreed to sell an aggregate of (i) shares of Common Stock, and (ii) Common Stock warrants (the Warrants to purchase up to shares of Common Stock for gross proceeds of million in a private placement. The closing of the Offering
occurred on March 4, 2021. 

The
Warrants require, at the option of the holder, a net-cash settlement following certain fundamental transactions (as defined in the Warrants)
at the Company. At the time of issuance, the Company maintained control of certain fundamental transactions and as such the Warrants
were initially classified in equity. As of December 31, 2022, the Company no longer maintained control of certain fundamental transactions
as they did not control a majority of shareholder votes. As such, the Company may be required to cash settle the Warrants if a fundamental
transaction occurs which is outside the Company s control. Accordingly, the Warrants are classified as liabilities. The Warrants
have been recorded at their fair value using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and will be recorded at their respective fair value at
each subsequent balance sheet date. This model incorporates transaction details such as the Company s stock price, contractual
terms, maturity, risk-free rates, as well as volatility. 

The
Warrants require the issuance of registered shares upon exercise, do not expressly preclude an implied right to cash settlement and are
therefore accounted for as derivative liabilities. The Company classifies these derivative warrant liabilities on the balance sheet as
a current liability.

The
risk-free interest rate was based on rates established by the Federal Reserve Bank. For the Warrants, the Company estimates expected
volatility giving primary consideration to the historical volatility of its Common Stock. The general expected volatility is based on
the standard deviation of the Company s underlying stock price s daily logarithmic returns. The expected life of the warrants
was determined by the expiration date of the warrants. The expected dividend yield was based on the fact that the Company has not historically
paid dividends on its Common Stock and does not expect to pay recurring dividends on its Common Stock in the future.

series, and shall have such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and qualifications,
limitations or restrictions thereof as shall be determined at the time of issuance by the Company s Board of Directors without
further action by the Company s shareholders. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing
a change in control of our company without further action by shareholders and could adversely affect the rights and powers, including
voting rights, of the holders of Common Stock. In certain circumstances, the issuance of preferred stock could depress the market price
of the Common Stock. 

On
January 1, 2021, members of the Company s management subscribed for shares of the Company s Series C-2 Convertible
Preferred Stock (the Series C-2 ), for a total of at per Share of Series C-2. The Company obtained an
independent valuation of the Series C-2 and of compensation expense was recognized, representing the difference between the
fair value and the proceeds received. 

BTCS
Inc. 

 NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The
Series C-2 is not mandatorily redeemable and is not unconditionally redeemable. The Series C-2 is callable by the Company. The Certificate
of Designation required that the Company, within 180 days of the Initial Issuance Date, call a special meeting of stockholders seeking
shareholder ratification of the issuance of the Series C-2. If the ratification of the issuance was not approved prior to the twelve-month
anniversary of the Initial Issuance Date (the Vote Deadline ), the Series C-2 would be redeemed at a price equal to 
of (i) the Stated Value per share plus (ii) all unpaid dividends thereon. Provided; further, if the Company had filed a proxy with the
SEC prior to the Vote Deadline but was unable to conduct a vote prior to the Vote Deadline then the Vote Deadline would have been extended
until such time as the vote was conducted. The Series C-2 holders were not entitled to vote on the ratification. The call provision would
have been automatically triggered if the ratification of the issuance was not approved in a special meeting of stockholders prior to
the twelve-month anniversary of the Initial Issuance Date. The Company held the meeting within the required period and the Series C-2
is no longer redeemable. 

Based
on the guidance in ASC 480-10-S99 ASR 268 ), a redeemable equity instrument is not to be included in permanent equity.
Rather, it should be reported between long-term debt and stockholders equity, without a subtotal that might imply it is a part
of stockholders equity (i.e., temporary equity or mezzanine capital ). ASR 268 specifies that redeemable
stock is any type of equity security, including common or preferred stock, when it has any condition for redemption which is not solely
within the control of the issuer without regard to probability. 

The
Series C-2 Certificate of Designation required the Company to redeem the Series C-2 if stockholder approval was not received by the Vote
Deadline. Stockholder approval was not considered to be solely within the Company s control. Stockholder approval
occurred on March 31, 2021, at which time the Series C-2 was no longer callable by the Company. As such, the Series C-2 was initially
classified in temporary equity under ASR 268 and was reclassified to permanent equity upon stockholder approval on March 31, 2021. 

The
holders of Series C-2 shall be entitled to receive dividends or distributions on each share of Series C-2 on an as-converted basis 
into Common Stock when and if dividends are declared on the Common Stock by the Board of Directors. Dividends shall be paid in cash or
property, as determined by the Board of Directors. 

At
any time or times on or after the two-year anniversary of the Initial Issuance Date, each Holder shall be entitled to convert any portion
of the outstanding Series C-2 held by such Holder into validly issued, fully-paid and non-assessable shares of Common at the Conversion
Rate. The Conversion Amount is subject to adjustment for certain capitalization and Anti-Dilution Events. The Series C-2 will automatically
be converted at the earlier of: (i) the four-year anniversary of the Initial Issuance Date, and (ii) simultaneously with the Company s
Common Stock being listed on a national securities exchange. The Conversion Rate is based upon the Conversion Price of which resulted
in a beneficial conversion feature at the time of issuance. As such, the Company recognized a beneficial conversion amount of 
as a reduction to the carrying amount of the convertible instrument. This discount will be amortized as a dividend over two years, the
earliest conversion date. Upon the conversion of Series C-2 into Common Stock on September 14, 2021, the total amortization of the beneficial
conversion feature is and the remaining discount is netted against additional paid in capital. 

The
Conversion Amount may be adjusted due to certain Anti-Dilution Events. On September 14, 2021, the Series C-2 was converted into 
shares of Common Stock.

directors of the Company. Effective as of January 1, 2021, the Company and each optionee executed Stock Option Agreements evidencing
the option grants. While stockholder approval (or ratification) of the grants was not required (under either the Stock Option Agreements
or by the resolutions of the Board of Directors approving such grants), the Board of Directors voluntarily caused the Company to seek
shareholder ratification of the grants to limit any potential exposure to breach of fiduciary duty claims. As a result, based on the

Term (years) 
 
 - 
 
 Expected stock price volatility 

Risk-free rate of interest 

Expected
Volatility : The Company uses historical volatility as it provides a reasonable estimate of the expected volatility. Historical volatility
is based on the most recent volatility of the stock price over a period of time equivalent to the expected term of the option. 

Risk-Free
Interest Rate : The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant for
the expected term of the option. 

Expected
Term : The Company s expected term represents the weighted-average period that the Company s stock options are expected
to be outstanding. The expected term is based on the expected time to post-vesting exercise of options by employees. The Company uses
historical exercise patterns of previously granted options to derive employee behavioral patterns used to forecast expected exercise
patterns. 

For
awards vesting upon the achievement of the market conditions which were met at the date of grant, compensation cost measured on the date
of grant was immediately recognized. For awards vesting upon the achievement of the market conditions which were not met at the date
of grant, compensation cost measured on the grant date will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on estimation
using a Monte-Carlo simulation.

The
Company s executive officers were granted RSUs as part of a long-term incentive LTI plan, with vesting terms set
for when the Company s market capitalization reaches and sustains a market capitalization for 30 consecutive days above four defined
market capitalization thresholds of million, million, million and million. On December 9, 2022, upon recommendation
of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the LTI plan, whereby the market capitalization threshold
targets were lowered to million, million, million, and million, effective January 1, 2023.

vest annually on each subsequent calendar year-end date over the four years following the one year anniversary of the grant date. 

For
awards vesting upon the achievement of a service condition, compensation cost measured on the grant date will be recognized on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period. Stock-based compensation expense for the market-based restricted stock units with explicit service conditions
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the longer of the derived service period or the explicit service period, regardless of whether
the market condition is satisfied. However, in the event that the explicit service period is not met, previously recognized compensation
cost would be reversed. Market-based restricted stock units subject to market-based performance targets require achievement of the performance
target as well as a service condition in order for these RSUs to vest.

Prior

would be subject to significant limitations pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 382. The Company has not completed its IRC Section
382 Valuation, as required, and the NOL s because of potential Change of Ownerships might be completely worthless. 

Therefore,
Management of the Company has recorded a Full Valuation Reserve, since it is more likely than not that no benefit will be realized for
the Deferred Tax Assets. 

In
assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future
taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal
of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and taxing strategies in making this assessment. In case the deferred tax
assets will not be realized in future periods, the Company has provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of the deferred tax
assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The valuation allowance increased by approximately million as of December 31, 2022.
