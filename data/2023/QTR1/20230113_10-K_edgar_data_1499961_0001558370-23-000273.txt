 Bollinger Motors to have a competitive advantage in the retail electric sport utility and commercial vehicle markets (Please refer to Note 4-Acquisition of Bollinger Motor Inc.). On October 22, 2022, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the Company acquisition of electric vehicle company ELMS (Electric Last Mile Solutions) assets in an all-cash purchase. In the Chapter 7 approved transaction, Mullen acquired ELMS manufacturing plant in Mishawaka Indiana, all inventory, and intellectual property for their Class 1 and Class 3 vehicles (See Note 20 Subsequent Events). The ELMS asset acquisition and the recent acquisition of the majority ownership of Bollinger Motors give Mullen the ability to integrate Bollinger s vehicle platforms, B1 and B2, along with Mullen s FIVE and FIVE RS platforms into an already existing former ELMS manufacturing facility. As a result, this will accelerate the launch of the Bollinger B1 and B2 consumer vehicles. Manufacturing optimization will include moving the Mullen FIVE EV Crossover production to the Mishawaka Factory from the Tunica, MS facility. Mullen FIVE production is planned to begin production in Q4 2024. Tunica will now become the Commercial Manufacturing Center and prepare to produce all Mullen and Bollinger Class 1 to 6 commercial vehicles. Bollinger Motors Launched in 2015, Bollinger Motors is an American automobile designer and manufacturer of electric sport utility and medium-duty vehicle lines. The company also successfully developed proprietary vehicle battery packs, drivetrains, and thermal and vehicle control software units. In 2017, Bollinger built and debuted the critically acclaimed B1 class 3 sport utility vehicle, the first of its kind. The company followed its initial success with the development of the second-generation B1 and B2 vehicles before pausing in favor of commercial truck development. With years of history in class 3 truck development, intellectual property, patents, and expertise, pre-acquisition focus was commercial vehicle development for classes 4-6. With Mullen s acquisition and capital injection, both B1 and B2 have resumed development and the plan is to begin production after the start of production for class 4-6 commercial truck programs. Bollinger Motors brings a significant pipeline of interest from large companies for commercial electric truck classes 4-6 in a wide range of markets such as last-mile delivery, refrigeration, utilities, and their upfitters. On Sept. 1, 2022, Bollinger revealed the B4, a class 4 electric commercial truck. The B4 electric chassis cabs will be the first of the company s commercial lineup to hit the ground in upcoming client test programs. The new Bollinger B4 incorporates years of feedback from dozens of major fleets looking to electrify their vehicles. The result is a cab-forward truck, designed from the ground up to offer maximum cargo volume, accommodate unlimited adaptation and prioritize safety.

 (with start of production in Q4 of 2024), while keeping expenditures low by utilizing strategic partnerships in engineering and manufacturing. 
 For our initial vehicle launches we will use state-of-the-art Li-Ion battery technology. We believe that our future solid state polymer battery technology will eventually allow us to deliver high voltage batteries under 100 per kWh at over two times the energy density of current commercially available lithium batteries. We anticipate the batteries used in our cars will be able to withstand extreme abuse testing, which we believe should make them safer than other commercially available lithium batteries. We plan to utilize a more environmentally sustainable chemistry that does not have a high content of rare precious materials. Our Market Opportunity Sustainable vehicles are the future of transportation In the last few years, we have observed a significant transformation in the motor vehicle landscape. Electric vehicles, which were once only a fringe element in a market dominated by major global automakers, are quickly becoming mainstream. Joining them, our company and several other start-ups are developing EV offerings. Passenger EV sales are set to continue rising sharply in the years ahead as policy pressure continues to increase, more models hit the market, and consumer interest takes off. Plug-in vehicle sales rise from 6.6 million in 2021 to 20.6 million in 2025. This is higher than the 2021 Outlook, due primarily to higher adoption in China. The rising cost of batteries does not derail near-term EV adoption. Some of the factors that are driving high battery raw material costs war, inflation, trade friction are also pushing the price of gasoline and diesel to record highs, which is driving more consumer interest in EVs. Internal combustion engine ICE vehicles are also becoming more expensive to produce. Most importantly, the market is shifting from being driven primarily by policy to where organic demand is the most important factor. Supply is a larger constraint on adoption than demand in many countries. The truck market use cases are highly varied. In urban duty cycles, battery electric trucks of any size become the cheapest option for several use cases in the 2020s. That is due to a combination of factors, including improving battery technologies and modest driving ranges. - Source: Bloomberg Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022. In our view, this trend is driven by several factors. A rising environmental consciousness is encouraging customers to weigh their emission footprint. As a zero-emission alternative to traditional internal combustion engine ICE options, an EV that can match or exceed an ICE in performance is a natural choice. Assisting with that choice, local and national governments are offering various forms of rebates and credits for the purchase of an EV and have otherwise begun to support the rise of e-mobility by accelerating the push for zero emission vehicles due to increased awareness of the impacts of global warming. As EV sales grow, parts volume is expected to grow in tandem, allowing automakers to purchase parts at a lower cost and further accelerating the switch to EVs. Lastly, the continuing improvement in battery technology,

 continuing build-out of electric charging infrastructure, and the growing comfort with EV range capabilities could ease range anxiety and facilitate adoption. Source: Derived from data in Bloomberg Electric Vehicle Outlook 2020 The rise of the Sports Utility Vehicle When designing our first EV offering in 2021, our team elected to develop a Sport Utility Vehicle SUV because of the recognized growth in SUV sales. According to market research, today s customers increasingly prefer SUVs to traditional sedans or crossovers. The importance of Commercial and Fleet Strategies Fleet and Commercial segments represent over 20 of the total U.S. market and is comprised of Government, Commercial and Rental segments. Mullen s Fleet First strategy with a Class One commercial van offering, followed quickly by Class 3 and Class 4 cab chassis models planned for 2023, takes advantage of segments vacated by competitors, and allows a first mover advantage for the company. O ur goal is to build strong customer relationships with fleet operators and companies that rent or lease vehicles to fleet operators and to capture a significant market opportunity as the broad trend of vehicle electrification continues Our Vehicles In 2022, we increased our existing product lines to include a Commercial EV Class 1 van and a Class 3 Cab chassis. The recent Bollinger Motors acquisition further expanded the product lines to include the B1 SUV and B2 pickup truck as well as Commercial Class 4-6 chassis, all of which are fully electric and built/assembled within the USA. Mullen FIVE and Mullen FIVE RS: The Mullen FIVE represents Mullen Automotive s entry into the full-electric, mid-size luxury SUV market. The Mullen FIVE is competitively priced starting at 55,000 - for the United States market before federal and state incentives are applied. Offering at least two optional packages, with a price range from a base price of 55,000 to 75,000 (for additional features), will allow customers to purchase a vehicle with options that best fit their budgetary and performance needs. The Mullen FIVE RS is a n ultra-high-performance EV that will feature a top speed of 200 mph and acceleration from 0-60 mph in just 1.9 seconds. The vehicle will be equipped with 800-volt architecture, all-wheel drive, a two-speed gearbox, and over 1,000 horsepower. Mullen Class 1 Van: The Mullen 1 van features specifications offering a good fit for a variety of applications like package delivery and service routes. Riding on a 120-inch wheelbase and measuring in at 186 inches long, 65 inches wide, and 75 inches tall, it has 160 cubic-feet of cargo volume accessible via dual sliding side doors or

 a tall rear liftgate. It features a curb weight of 3,329 pounds and can carry a maximum payload of 1,700 pounds up to 110 miles with its 42kWh battery. Turning radius is approximately 20 feet, about the same as the smaller Ford Transit van. Mullen Class 3: The Mullen 3 is a Class 3 commercial electric vehicle targeting over 5,800 pounds of max payload, 11,000 pounds gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) and approximately 120 miles of range with its 81 KwH battery. The cab-over-chassis design of the vehicle is configurable and can be outfitted with a dry box, flat bed, stake bed, and other customizable cargo options. The cab-over design not only provides great visibility for the driver, but also results in a tight turning circle of approximately 38 ft, which makes this truck extremely maneuverable on narrow city streets. We believe the introduction of the Mullen 3 will expand our target vocations, including delivery, construction, landscaping, towing, and refrigeration. Bollinger B1 and B2: By designing the Bollinger B1, all-electric four-wheel-drive SUV from the ground up, the Bollinger Motors team created a new platform of electric trucks capable of exceptional off-road performance, combined with never-before-seen cargo and utility features. The Bollinger all-wheel-drive dual-motor drivetrain creates instantly available torque, 50/50 weight distribution, unbeatable traction and best-in-class ground clearance boasting a 10 to 20 adjustable ride height. The Bollinger B2 electric pickup truck is the big brother of the B1 SUV, same everything inside and out, except for the long pickup truck bed. The B2 is a powerful electric pickup truck with a six-foot bed that can carry 16-feet of cargo length through a patented full-vehicle-length passthrough with gates closed. Bollinger B4 Chassis Cab: The all-new Bollinger B4 chassis is designed from the ground up with driver safety and fleet efficiency as first priority. These purpose-built electric trucks have been designed to be custom configured by fleets to fit their duty cycle needs, making transitioning to electric as seamless as possible with minimal down time. With a GVWR of 14,001 to 16,000 pounds, the Bollinger B4 can carry over 8,350 lbs. of payload when equipped with dual battery packs. With a 158 in wheelbase, this chassis can be upfitted with a body length up to 18 ft., yet still be capable of an impressive turning circle. These attributes make this truck an excellent choice for city driving. Every aspect of these trucks has been streamlined to be as versatile as possible. The cab forward design provides better visibility and frees up space behind the driver for more cargo area. Bollinger B4 Platform: The DNA and driving force behind the Bollinger B4 Chassis Cab is the Bollinger B4 Platform. It incorporates years of our obsessive electric truck development and feedback from commercial customers looking to electrify their fleets in the best, most efficient way possible. The result is a highly configurable chassis base, which can be upfitted to accommodate most fleet duty cycles, prioritizing efficiency, handling, comfort for fleet drivers, and the overall safety of humans in and around it. Mullen I-GO : Perfect for urban European markets, the Mullen I-GO bridges the gap between the growing demand for quick deliveries and space constraints in dense cities throughout Europe. The I-GO commercial EV is EU standard homologated, certified, and ready for sale in initial markets of UK, Germany, Spain, France, and Ireland, with the first sample vehicle to be delivered to our Ireland distributor in January 2023. The I-GO is a small class 1 vehicle with dimensions that include a 96 inch wheelbase and gross vehicle weight of 1,753 lbs. I- GO Platform:

After successfully completing a series of validations tests at the cell level, testing will proceed to the vehicle pack level. In a combined effort with our partner to bring this technology to market, both parties agree to work on the design, development, and testing of battery packs and battery management systems for electric vehicles. While we continue our testing, our manufacturing team is working on establishing the future assembly processes for volume production. Our Growth Strategy We intend to leverage the following growth strategies to drive stakeholder value: Continue to develop the Mullen FIVE. We intend to continue to invest in research and development and work on establishing partnerships that would enable us to start initial vehicle production in the fourth quarter of 2024. Recognize the significant opportunities within the Commercial and Fleet Markets . In addition to entering the largest passenger vehicle segment where the Mullen Five will compete, Mullen through acquisition will aggressively enter the rapidly expanding Electric Commercial vehicle segment in 2023. 
 Our Manufacturing Approach We have a 124,700 sq ft facility located in Tunica, Mississippi that was purchased during 2021 and currently there is a planned expansion of approximately 200,000 sq ft giving Mullen over 320,000 sq ft for our commercial production lines . Mullen s commercial EV lineup includes Class 1-3 cargo van and cab chassis offerings and Bollinger Motors Class 4-6 chassis products.

 Through the ELMS asset acquisition, Mullen acquired a 675,000 sq ft manufacturing facility. This was the original manufacturing plant for General Motors Hummer H2 production, and later the Mercedes-Benz R-Class. There have been many upgrades to the plant by the prior owners and most importantly the plant has been converted to manufacture Electric Vehicles. This plant will be the Retail Vehicle Manufacturing plant, currently planned to produce the Mullen FIVE and the Bollinger B1 and B2.

 Marketing Strategy Consumer Marketing of Passenger Vehicles We will utilize strategic regional and national tradeshows, sporting and automotive events to showcase our vehicles in person and generate further interest, reservations and vehicle orders. Beginning in October 2022, the Company launched the Strikingly Different EV Crossover Tour of the Mullen FIVE. The Mullen FIVE EV Crossover vehicle on tour is equipped with a completely updated infotainment system featuring PERSONA, Mullen s proprietary Personal Vehicle Assistant (PVA), which utilizes facial recognition technology to provide every driver with a highly personalized experience. Participants had the opportunity to interact with and witness PERSONA in action. The nine City Tour ran through mid-December 2022 with the final stop at the Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina. We also intend to increase our online focus in 2023 to include online vehicle ordering, allowing customers full online vehicle purchase, with trade-in quote, financing, and insurance options. Customer delivery is planned to be scheduled for Mullen At Home delivery or delivered to closest Mullen Lounge Point location, as described below. Mullen Lounge Point Lounge Point is expected to be the retail center experience for our retail sales network in North America and is planned to feature full vehicle sales interaction including test drives, reservations, orders, trade-in, finance, insurance, and delivery. Our approach is planned to be focused on superior consumer experience in an easily accessible retail environment with a no pressure sales approach. Our focus will be on delivering a premium vehicle experience while fitting nicely into everyday consumer life. It is expected that our initial set of retail Lounge Points will be established in high foot traffic centers where consumers visit daily and not on a distant dealer row. This could be Main Street, outdoor based malls, entertainment complexes, commuter hubs and weekend leisure destinations. Mullen Service Point and Mobile Service It s envisioned that Mullen Service Points will be established near our planned retail sales Lounge Points, but not directly in the same location. Our sales and service locations are expected to serve different customer opportunities and require drastically different layouts and square footage requirements. Establishing Service Points away from sales points lowers our square footage cost and is expected to allow us to focus on an exceptional customer experience. It is expected that Mullen Service Points will be outfitted with the latest tools and repair service technology to efficiently service our vehicles. We also envision offering vehicle collision repair and detailing services.

 We envision operating a mobile fleet of service vehicles that will be available for offsite vehicle repair and service. It is expected that our mobile service technicians will be able to address and resolve most vehicle repairs while at the customer s home or place of work. It is expected that over-the-air OTA software updates and repairs will be made available to our vehicles via Wi-Fi or cellular connection. We believe we will be able to address specific vehicle alerts, allowing us to diagnosis and possibly fix the vehicle remotely, depending on the problem. It is also expected that general software updates will be conducted OTA as well. In general, OTA repairs and updates require less service visits for customers and better overall customer experience. Mullen Commercial Sales, Service and Distribution Commercial marketing strategy includes forming partnerships with strong existing top performing commercial dealerships that will cover the National fleet business requirements. On December 13, 2022, the Company announced Randy Marion Isuzu LLC as its first dealer group partner for Mullen s commercial EV lineup, which is set to launch in the U.S. in 2023 (See Note 20 - Subsequent Events). Additional large commercial dealers will be added in 2023 to expand the coverage, with initial dealers identified in California based on criteria driven by potential customers, size of fleets and state incentives. Government Procurement Programs The Company also plans to focus on U.S. Government vehicle procurement programs. The Biden administration issued an executive order in 2021 focused on revitalizing the electric-vehicle (EV) program of the U.S. government, requiring the replacement of the government s entire fleet of about 650,000 vehicles with American-made EVs. Currently today, approximately 1 of the federal fleet consists of EV vehicles. The Company focus is establishing Mullen s EV lineup within the overall federal fleet procurement process. Research and Development As an emerging automaker, we will rely heavily on research and development to establish and strengthen our market position. We will primarily conduct our research and development activities at our headquarters in Irvine, California, for the Mullen FIVE and at our Troy, Michigan facility for the Commercial Platforms. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we incurred research and development expense of approximately 21.7 million, which includes the development of 2 Mullen Five show cars that were debuted at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November 2021 and the building of our Mullen Five demonstrator vehicles. Other expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research as well as contract and professional services. Intellectual Property We place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio. As part of our business, we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations and designs such as with respect to patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other measures, including through employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements. Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We have nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements with our consultants and employees, and we seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information through non-disclosure agreements with our vendors and business partners. Trademarks and Patents We plan to file additional applications for the registration of our trademarks and issuances of patents in the United States and foreign jurisdictions as our business expands under current and planned distribution arrangements. Protection of registered trademarks and issued patents in some jurisdictions may not be as extensive as the protection provided by the 
 15 

Table of Contents 
 United States. There are no assurances given that pending applications will be granted or that they will, if granted, contain all of the claims currently included in the applications. Refer to Intellectual Property Table. Company Patents Trademarks Status Total U.S. Non U.S. U.S. Non U.S. Comments Mullen Automotive 5 7 7 42 Issued/Registered 61 Not included are 117 patents pending Bollinger Motors 8 8 5 6 Issued/Registered 27 Not included are 5 trademarks pending/allowed; 8 patents are pending Total 88 Trade Secrets We own certain intellectual property, including trade secrets, which we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with employees and other parties. Even where these agreements exist, there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors. We intend to protect our legal rights concerning intellectual property by all appropriate legal action. Consequently, we may become involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of any of the foregoing proprietary rights. Any patent litigation could result in substantial cost and divert the efforts of management and technical personnel. Government Regulation and Credits We operate in an industry that is subject to extensive environmental regulation, which has become more stringent over time. The laws and regulations to which we are subject govern, among others, water use; air emissions; use of recycled materials; energy sources; the storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials; the protection of the environment, natural resources and endangered species; and the remediation of environmental contamination. Compliance with such laws and regulations at an international, regional, national, provincial and local level is an important aspect of our ability to continue our operations. Environmental standards applicable to us are established by the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate, including standards adopted by regulatory agencies as well as the permits and licenses required by such agencies. Each of these sources is subject to periodic modifications and we anticipate increasingly stringent requirements. Violations of these laws, regulations or permits and licenses may result in substantial civil and criminal fines, penalties, and possibly orders to cease the violating operations or to conduct or pay for corrective works. In some instances, violations may also result in the suspension or revocation of permits and licenses. Emissions In the Unites States, Europe and China, there are vehicle emissions performance standards that may provide an opportunity for us to sell emissions credits. United States California has greenhouse gas emissions standards that closely follow the standards of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA ). The registration and sale of Zero Emission Vehicles ZEVs in California will earn us ZEV credits that we can sell to other OEMs. Other states within the United States have adopted similar standards include 
 16 

Table of Contents 
 Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont. We intend to take advantage of these regimes by registering and selling ZEVs in these other states. ZEV credits in California are calculated under the ZEV Regulation and are paid in relation to ZEVs sold and registered in California including Battery Electric Vehicles BEVs and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles FCEVs ). The ZEV program assigns ZEV credits to each vehicle manufacturer. Vehicle manufacturers are required to maintain ZEV credits equal to a set percentage of non-electric vehicles sold and registered in California. Each vehicle sold and registered in California earns a number of credits based on the drivetrain type and the all-electric range AER of the vehicle under the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule Test Cycle. Plug-in hybrid vehicles PHEVs receive between 0.4 and 1.3 credits per vehicle sold and registered in California. Battery electric and fuel cell vehicles receive between one and four credits per vehicle sold in California, based on range. The credit requirement was 7 in 2019 which required about 3 of sales to be ZEVs. The credit requirement will rise to 22 in 2025, which will require about 8 of sales to be ZEVs. If a vehicle manufacturer does not produce enough EVs to meet its quota, it can choose to buy credits from other manufacturers who do, or pay a 5,000 fine for each credit such manufacturer is short. This could provide an opportunity for us to sell credits to other manufacturers that may not have met their quota. EPA Emissions and Certificate of Conformity The United States Clean Air Act requires that we obtain a Certificate of Conformity issued by the EPA and a California Executive Order issued by the California Air Resources Board CARB concerning emissions for our vehicles. A Certificate of Conformity is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act s standards, and an Executive Order is required for vehicles sold in states that have sought and received a waiver from the EPA to utilize California standards. CARB sets the California standards for emissions control for certain regulated pollutants for new vehicles and engines sold in California. States that have adopted the California standards as approved by EPA also recognize the Executive Order for sales of vehicles. There are currently four states which have adopted the California standard for heavy-duty vehicles. The Greenhouse Gas Rule was incorporated into the Clean Air Act on August 9, 2011. Even though Mullen s vehicles have zero-emissions, Mullen is still required to seek an EPA Certificate of Conformity for the Greenhouse Gas Rule and a CARB Executive Order for the CARB Greenhouse Gas Rule. Vehicle Safety and Testing Our vehicles will be subject to, and will be required to comply with, numerous regulatory requirements established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA ), including applicable United States federal motor vehicle safety standards FMVSS ). All Mullen products will fully comply with all applicable FMVSS without the need for any exemptions and expect our future vehicles to either fully comply or comply with limited exemptions related to specific new technologies. Additionally, there are regulatory changes being considered for several FMVSS, and while we anticipate compliance, there is no assurance until final regulation changes are enacted. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSSs, before the vehicles can be sold in the U.S. Some examples of FMVSS rules that will apply to our vehicles are crashworthiness, crash avoidance and EV requirements. We will also be required to comply with other federal laws administered by the NHTSA, including Theft Prevention Act requirements, consumer information labeling requirements, Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign and owner s manual requirements. The Automobile Information and Disclosure Act requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, this law allows inclusion 
 17 

Table of Contents 
 of city and highway fuel economy ratings, as determined by the EPA, as well as crash test ratings as determined by the NHTSA if such tests are conducted. Our vehicles that may be sold outside of the United States are subject to similar foreign safety, environmental and other regulations. Many of those regulations are different from those applicable in the United States and may require redesign and/or retesting. The European Union has established new rules regarding additional compliance oversight that were scheduled to commence in 2020, and there is also regulatory uncertainty related to the United Kingdom s withdrawal from the European Union. These changes could impact the rollout of new vehicle features in Europe. In addition to the various territorial legal requirements Mullen is obligated to meet, we plan to engineer the Mullen FIVE to deliver 5-star performance in the two main voluntary vehicle safety performance assessment programs, United States New Car Assessment Program NCAP and Euro NCAP. 5-star is the maximum attainable score. These independent organizations have introduced several additional safety related tests aimed at improving the safety of passenger vehicles, both for occupants and pedestrians involved in collisions with vehicles. Some of these tests are derived from the legal tests, such as side impact, but have higher performance requirements. Others are unique to the program. Areas covered by these tests include: Mobile Progressive Deformable Barrier, Full width rigid barrier, mobile side impact barrier and others. 
 We intend that the Mullen FIVE will also be equipped with certain advanced driving assistance features which may allow us to garner further Euro NCAP awards for features which are not yet a formal part of the 5-Star rating. This will help promote the advanced societal benefits of the Mullen FIVE. Recent Acquisitions Bollinger Motors 60 Controlling Interest On September 7, Mullen Automotive, Inc.

 Risk Factors Risks Related to our Capital Requirements and Financial Condition We have incurred significant losses since inception and we expect that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, which makes it difficult to assess our future viability. We have not been profitable since operations commenced, and we may never achieve or sustain profitability. In addition, we have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields such as the electric vehicle EV industry. Development and deployment of EV technology and vehicles is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We have not yet commercialized any of our proposed EV products or generated any revenue from sales of such products. We have devoted significant resources to research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. We will require significant additional capital to continue operations and to execute current business strategy. Mullen cannot estimate with reasonable certainty the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our proposed products and there is no certainty that we will be able to raise the necessary capital on reasonable terms or at all. We will require substantial additional financing to effectuate our business plan, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development efforts or other operations. For the years ended September 30, 2022, and 2021, we incurred net losses of 154.7 million and 44.2 million, respectively, and net cash used in operating activities was 63.1 million and 17.5 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of 305.1 million. We will need significant capital to, among other things, conduct research and development, increase our production capacity, and expand our sales and service network. 
 22 

Table of Contents 
 We expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses for the next several years as we advance our product development and commercialization efforts. No substantial revenue from operations will likely be available until, and unless, such efforts are successful. We expect our capital expenditures to continue to be significant in the foreseeable future as we expand our business, and that once our cars are in production our level of capital expenditures will be significantly affected by user demand for our products and services. The fact that we have a limited operating history means we have limited historical data on the demand for our products and services. As a result, our future capital requirements may be uncertain and actual capital requirements may be different from those we currently anticipate. We will likely need to seek equity or debt financing to finance a portion of our capital expenditures. Such financing might not be available to us in a timely manner, or on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Our ability to obtain the necessary financing to carry out our business plan is subject to a number of factors, including general market conditions and investor acceptance of our business plan. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms and conditions of such financing unattractive or unavailable to us. In particular, recent disruptions in the financial markets and volatile economic conditions could affect our ability to raise capital. If we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish certain valuable rights to our product candidates, technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable. If we raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of any new equity securities may have preferential rights over our Common Stock and further may restrict our ability to obtain additional financing even if needed to continue operations. Further, the ability to fund our needs through equity issuances, warrants or convertible debt is or may be limited by covenants in certain of our existing and future funding or other agreements. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we would have increased debt service obligations and may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt or making capital expenditures, or subject to specified financial ratios, any of which could restrict our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates or operate as a business. Additional capital may not be available when we need it, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing, manufacturing or distribution capabilities, development activities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our proposed products or other development activities. We might not be able to obtain any funding, and we might not have sufficient resources to conduct our business as projected, both of which could mean that we would be forced to curtail or discontinue our operations. We have not yet manufactured or sold any production vehicles to customers and may never develop or manufacture any vehicles. We have no experience as an organization in high volume manufacturing of the planned electric vehicles and we cannot assure you that us or our partners will be able to develop efficient, automated, cost-efficient manufacturing capability and processes, and reliable sources of component supplies that will enable us to meet the quality, price, engineering, design and production standards, as well as the production volumes, required to successfully mass market our EVs. Even if we are able to successfully develop and sell or lease our vehicles, there can be no assurance that we will be commercially successful and achieve or sustain profitability. As a new entrant into our industry, we will face significant risks and challenges to our business and prospects, including, among other things, with respect to our ability to: design and produce safe, reliable and quality vehicles on an ongoing basis; obtain the necessary regulatory approvals in a timely manner; build a well-recognized and respected brand; establish and expand our customer base;

 successfully market our vehicles and the other services we intend to provide; properly price our services, including our charging solutions, financing and lease options, and successfully anticipate the take-rate and usage of such services by users; successfully service our vehicles after sales and maintain a good flow of spare parts and customer goodwill; establish and maintain our operational efficiency; predict our future revenues and appropriately budget for our expenses; attract, retain and motivate talented employees; anticipate trends that may emerge and affect our business; and anticipate and adapt to changing market conditions, including technological developments and changes in the competitive landscape. 
 If we fail to adequately address any or all of these risks and challenges, our business may be materially and adversely affected. Our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future business prospects. As we attempt to transition from research and development activities to commercial production and sales, it is difficult, if not impossible, to forecast our future results, and we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. The estimated costs and timelines that we have developed to reach full scale commercial production are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties involved in the transition from a start-up company focused on research and development activities to the large-scale manufacture and sale of vehicles. There can be no assurance that our estimates related to the costs and timing necessary to complete the design and engineering of our EVs and tool our facilities will prove accurate. These are complex processes that may be subject to delays, cost overruns and other unforeseen issues. For example, the tooling required within our facilities may be more expensive to produce than predicted, or have a shorter lifespan, resulting in additional replacement and maintenance costs, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Similarly, we may experience higher raw material waste in the composite process than we expect, resulting in higher operating costs and hampering our ability to be profitable. In addition, market conditions, many of which are outside of our control and subject to change, including general economic conditions, the availability and terms of financing, the impacts and ongoing uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic, fuel and energy prices, regulatory requirements and incentives, competition and the pace and extent of vehicle electrification generally, will impact demand for our electric vehicles, and ultimately our success. There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional debt or equity financings or enter strategic partnerships. Since our inception, we have financed our operations through convertible debt and preferred stock financings. We intend to continue to finance our operations through debt or equity financing and/or strategic partnerships. The failure to obtain sufficient financing or strategic partnerships could adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives and continue as a going concern.

 Our senior lender has a security interest on all our assets and the Internal Revenue Service has liens on our assets, and if these lienholders foreclose, that would be detrimental to our business, our financial condition and our ability to continue as a going concern. Our senior lender has a security interest on all of our assets. In addition, we have liabilities of 1.7 million due to the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS ). We are in default on such loan. Should either our senior lender or the IRS foreclose, each could secure judgments against our assets. This would be materially detrimental to our business, our financial condition and our ability to operate as a going concern. We have not paid cash dividends on our Common Stock in the past and do not expect to pay dividends on our Common Stock in the future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our Common Stock. We have never paid cash dividends on our Common Stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the near future. The payment of dividends on our Common Stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as the Board of Directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our Common Stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates. We may not be able to maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Markets. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Markets. To maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other requirements including, without limitation, a requirement that our closing bid price be at least 1.00 per share. On September 7, 2022, we were notified by NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Staff about bid price deficiency. The Board and Management are reviewing plans to regain compliance with the 1.00 closing bid price requirement. If the Company does not regain compliance with the bid price requirement by March 6, 2023 , the Company may be eligible for an additional 180-calendar day compliance period so long as it satisfies the criteria for initial listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market and the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and the Company provides written notice to Nasdaq of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If we fail to continue to meet all applicable continued listing requirements for The Nasdaq Capital Market in the future and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock, our ability to obtain financing to repay debt and fund our operations. Our commitments to issue shares of Common Stock or securities that are convertible into shares of Common Stock may cause significant dilution to stockholders. Pursuant to Amendment No. 3, the investors paid 150 million and in lieu of receiving shares of Series D Preferred Stock and Warrants, the investors received the Notes, which outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest on the Notes convert into shares of Common Stock. The conversion price per share of Common Stock is equal to the lower of (i) 0.303, the closing price of the Common Stock on Nasdaq on November 14, 2022, and (ii) (A) if mandatorily converted on November 21, 2022, the closing price of the Common Stock on Nasdaq on November 18, 2022 or (B) if converted after January 3, 2022, the closing price of the Common Stock on Nasdaq on January 3, 2022, both (A) and (B) being subject to a floor price of 0.10 per share. For no additional consideration, for every share of Common Stock issued to a holder upon conversion of a Note, the holder shall receive Warrants exercisable for 185 of the Common Stock at an exercise price equal to the conversion price applicable at the time of conversion of such Note, subject to further adjustment as provided in the Warrant. Amendment No. 3 further provides that the remaining 90 million of the Commitment Amount shall be paid in two tranches, on January 24, 2023, and February 24, 2023. The purchase price per share of Series D Preferred Stock will be the lower of (i) 1.27, the closing price of the Company s stock on the date the Securities Purchase Agreement was executed, or (ii) the closing price of the Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the respective Purchase Date, subject to a floor price of 0.10 per share. For no additional consideration, for every share of Series D Preferred Stock purchased, such investor shall receive Warrants exercisable for 185 shares of Series D Preferred Stock purchased by the investors at an exercise price equal to the purchase price for shares of Series D Preferred Stock.

 Finally, Amendment No. 3 further provides that from April 1, 2023 until June 30, 2023, the investors shall have the right, but not the obligation, at any time from time to time, in each investors sole and absolute discretion to purchase additional shares of Series D Preferred Stock from the Company in an amount equal to such investor s pro rata portion of 100,000,000 on the same terms and conditions as applicable to the purchase and sale of shares of Series D Preferred Stock as provided under the Securities Purchase Agreement, including that each investor exercising such right shall receive a proportional amount of Warrants exercisable for 110 of shares of Series D Preferred Stock purchased by the investors at an exercise price equal to the purchase price for shares of Series D Preferred Stock. Implementation of Amendment No. 3 would cause issuance of additional shares Common Stock or issuance of shares Common Stock upon the conversion of shares of Series D Preferred Stock and Warrants, which in turn would dilute the percentage ownership interest of holders of our Common Stock, dilute the book value per share of our Common Stock and increase the number of our publicly traded shares, which could depress the market price of our Common Stock. Our commitment to issue shares of Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Notes, our Preferred Stock and the Warrants could encourage short sales by third parties which could contribute to the future decline of stock price. Our commitment to issue shares of Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Notes, our Preferred Stock and the Warrants has the potential to cause significant downward pressure on the price of our Common Stock. In such an environment, short sellers may exacerbate any decline of our stock price. If there are significant short sales of our Common Stock, the share price of our Common Stock may decline more than it would in an environment without such activity. This may cause other holders of our Common Stock to sell their shares. If there are many more shares of our Common Stock on the market for sale than the market will absorb, the price of our common shares will likely decline. Our investors may participate in short sales of our Common Stock. They may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers, which may in turn engage in short sales of the shares of Common Stock in the course of hedging in positions they assume. Our investors may also sell shares of Common Stock short and deliver shares of Common Stock covered by their investments to close out short positions and to return borrowed shares in connection with such short sales. Our investors may also loan or pledge shares of Common Stock to broker-dealers that in turn may sell such shares. Such activity could cause a decline in the market price of the shares of our Common Stock. Our stockholders are subject to significant dilution upon the occurrence of certain events which could result in a decrease in our stock price. As of January 6, 2023, we had outstanding 1,693,663,180 shares of Common Stock. As of that same date, we also had outstanding 1,925 shares of Series A Preferred Stock convertible into an aggregate of 192,500 shares of Common Stock, 1,211,757 shares of Series C Preferred Stock convertible into an aggregate of 1,211,757 shares of Common Stock and 363,097 shares of Series D Preferred Stock convertible into an aggregate of 363,097 shares of Common Stock. The issuance of shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of such shares of Preferred Stock would dilute the percentage ownership interest of holders of our Common Stock, dilute the book value per share of our Common Stock and increase the number of our publicly traded shares, which could depress the market price of our Common Stock. In addition, the shares of Series D Preferred Stock contain weighted average anti-dilution provisions which, subject to limited exceptions, would increase the number of shares issuable upon conversion of such preferred stock (by reducing the conversion price of the Series D Preferred Stock) in the event that we in the future issue Common Stock, or securities convertible into or exercisable to purchase Common Stock, at a price per share lower than the conversion price then in effect. We may have insufficient authorized and reserved shares . If at any time there are warrants, preferred stock and convertible notes that remain outstanding, and the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and unreserved shares of Common Stock to satisfy its obligation to reserve for issuance the Required Reserve Amount (an Authorized Share Failure ), then the Company shall promptly take all action reasonably necessary to increase the Company s authorized shares of Common Stock to an amount sufficient to allow the Company to reserve the Required Reserve Amount for the convertible securities then outstanding. In no event later than 
 26 

Table of Contents 
 ninety (90) days after the occurrence of such Authorized Share Failure, the Company shall hold a meeting of its stockholders for the approval of an increase in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock. In connection with such meeting, the Company shall provide each stockholder with a proxy statement and shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit its stockholders approval of such increase in authorized shares of Common Stock and to cause its board of directors to recommend to the stockholders that they approve such proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such time of an Authorized Share Failure, the Company is able to obtain the written consent of a majority of the shares of its issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock to approve the increase in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock, the Company may satisfy this obligation by obtaining such consent and submitting for filing with the SEC the Information Statement on Schedule 14-C. Risks Related to our Business and Operations Potential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute stockholder value. In 2022, we have been an active acquirer of two entities. We have sought merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services. Acquiring related electric businesses involve various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things: 

potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target entity; 

exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target entity; 

difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target entity; 

potential disruption to our business; 

potential diversion of our management s time and attention; 

the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target entity; 

difficulty in estimating the value of the target entity; and 

potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target entity. We regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other businesses. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur at any time. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may be unable to develop, manufacture and obtain required regulatory approvals for a car of sufficient quality to appeal to customers on schedule or at all, or may be unable to do so on a large scale. Our business depends in large part on our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell or lease our EVs. Our ability to effectively compete in the EV market will depend in large part on our entry into the ESUV market through the offering of competitively priced vehicles to a wider variety of potential buyers. 
 27 

Table of Contents 
 We initially plan to manufacture vehicles in collaboration with one or more automotive component and engineering services suppliers, including large OEMs or tier-one automotive suppliers. We have not yet executed definitive supply or manufacturing agreements with any OEM or tier-one automotive supplier for the supply of parts for production of our initially proposed ESUVs or any of our other future vehicle offerings. If we are unable to negotiate and finalize such supply and manufacturing agreements with an OEM or a tier-one automotive supplier, we will not be able to produce any ESUVs and will not be able to generate significant revenue, or the vehicles may become more expensive to deliver with a higher bill of materials, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. The continued development and the ability to start manufacturing our vehicles are and will be subject to risks, including with respect to: our ability to secure necessary funding; our ability to accurately manufacture vehicles within specified design tolerances; obtaining required regulatory approvals and certifications; compliance with environmental, safety, and similar regulations; securing necessary components, services, or licenses on acceptable terms and in a timely manner; delays in delivering final component designs to our suppliers; our ability to attract, recruit, hire, retain and train skilled employees; quality controls that prove to be ineffective or inefficient; delays or disruptions in our supply chain including raw material supplies; our ability to maintain arrangements on reasonable terms with our manufacturing partners and suppliers, engineering service providers, delivery partners, and after sales service providers; and other delays, backlog in manufacturing and research and development of new models, and cost overruns. 
 Our ability to develop, manufacture and obtain required regulatory approvals for a vehicle of sufficient quality to appeal to customers on schedule and on a large scale is unproven, and the business plan is still evolving. We may be required to introduce new vehicle models and enhanced versions of existing models. To date, we have limited experience, as a company, designing, testing, manufacturing, marketing and selling or leasing our electric vehicles and therefore cannot assure you that we will be able to meet customer expectations. Any failure to develop such manufacturing processes and capabilities within our projected costs and timelines would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. Our vehicles will make use of lithium-ion battery cells, which have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame, and, if such results occur, bodily injury or death could result and could subject us to lawsuit, product recalls, or redesign efforts. The battery packs within our proposed vehicles will make use of lithium-ion cells. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. While the battery pack is designed to contain any single cell s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells, once our vehicles are commercially available, a field or testing failure of battery packs in our vehicles could occur, which could result in bodily injury or death and could subject us to lawsuit, product recalls, or redesign efforts, all of which would be time consuming and expensive and could harm our brand image. Also, negative 
 28 

Table of Contents 
 public perceptions regarding the suitability of lithium-ion cells for automotive applications, the social and environmental impacts of cobalt mining, or any future incident involving lithium-ion cells, such as a vehicle or other fire, could seriously harm our business and reputation. The efficiency of a battery s use over time when driving electric vehicles will decline over time, which may negatively influence potential customers decisions whether to purchase an electric vehicle. The cells used in EV battery modules degrade over time, influenced primarily by the age of the cells and the total energy throughput over the life of the EV. This cell degradation results in a corresponding reduction in the vehicle s range. Although common to all EVs, cell degradation, and the related decrease in range, may negatively influence potential customer s EV purchase decisions. We are substantially reliant on our relationships with OEMs, suppliers and service providers for the parts and components in our vehicles, as well as for the manufacture of our initial vehicles. If any of these OEMs, suppliers or service partners choose to not do business with us, then we would have significant difficulty in procuring and producing our vehicles and our business prospects would be significantly harmed. Collaboration with third parties for the manufacturing of vehicles is subject to risks with respect to operations that are outside our control. We could experience delays to the extent our current or future partners do not continue doing business with us or fail to meet agreed upon timelines, experience capacity constraints or otherwise are unable to deliver components or manufacture vehicles as expected. There is a risk of potential disputes with partners, and we could be affected by adverse publicity related to our partners whether or not such publicity is related to their collaboration with us. In addition, although we intend to be involved in material decisions in the supply chain process, given that we also rely on our partners to meet our quality standards, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain high quality standards. We may in the future enter into strategic alliances, including joint ventures or minority equity investments, with various third parties to further our business purpose. These alliances could subject us to a number of risks, including risks associated with sharing proprietary information, non-performance by the third party, and increased expenses in establishing new strategic alliances, any of which may materially and adversely affect our business. We will rely on complex machinery for our operations and production involves a significant degree of risk and uncertainty in terms of operational performance and costs. We will rely heavily on complex machinery for our operations and our production will involve a significant degree of uncertainty and risk in terms of operational performance and costs. It is expected that our manufacturing plant will consist of large-scale machinery combining many components. The manufacturing plant components are likely to suffer unexpected malfunctions from time to time and will depend on repairs and spare parts to resume operations, which may not be available when needed. Unexpected malfunctions of the manufacturing plant components may significantly affect the intended operational efficiency. Operational performance and costs can be difficult to predict and are often influenced by factors outside of our control, such as, but not limited to, scarcity of natural resources, environmental hazards and remediation, costs associated with decommissioning of machines, labor disputes and strikes, difficulty or delays in obtaining governmental permits, damages or defects in electronic systems, industrial accidents, fire, and seismic activity and natural disasters. Should operational risks materialize, they may result in the personal injury to or death of workers, the loss of production equipment, damage to manufacturing facilities, monetary losses, delays and unanticipated fluctuations in production, environmental damage, administrative fines, increased insurance costs and potential legal liabilities, all which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition or prospects. There are complex software and technology systems that need to be developed in coordination with vendors and suppliers in order to reach production for our EVs, and there can be no assurance such systems will be successfully developed. Our vehicles will use a substantial amount of third-party and in-house software codes and complex hardware to operate. The development of such advanced technologies is inherently complex, and we will need to coordinate with our vendors 
 29 

Table of Contents 
 and suppliers in order to reach production for our EVs. Defects and errors may be revealed over time and our control over the performance of third-party services and systems may be limited. Thus, our potential inability to develop the necessary software and technology systems may harm our competitive position. We are relying on third-party suppliers to develop a number of emerging technologies for use in our products, including solid-state polymer battery technology. These technologies are not today, and may not ever be, commercially viable. There can be no assurances that our suppliers will be able to meet the technological requirements, production timing, and volume requirements to support our business plan. In addition, the technology may not comply with the cost, performance useful life and warranty characteristics we anticipate in our business plan. As a result, our business plan could be significantly impacted, and we may incur significant liabilities under warranty claims which could adversely affect our business, prospects, and results of operations. We may experience significant delays in the design, manufacture, regulatory approval, launch and financing of our vehicles, which could harm our business and prospects. Any delay in the financing, design, manufacture, regulatory approval or launch of our vehicles, including entering into agreements for platform sharing, supply of component parts, and manufacturing, could materially damage our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results and could cause liquidity constraints. Vehicle manufacturers often experience delays in the design, manufacture and commercial release of new products. To the extent we delay the launch of our vehicles, our growth prospects could be adversely affected as we may fail to establish or increase our market share. We rely on third-party suppliers for the provision and development of the key components and materials used in our vehicles. To the extent our suppliers experience any delays in providing us with or developing necessary components, we could experience delays in delivering on our timelines. We will be dependent on our suppliers, a significant number of which are single or limited source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our vehicles in a timely manner and at prices and volumes acceptable to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and operating results. While we plan to obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible, many of the components used in our vehicles will be purchased by us from a single source. While we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components for our single source components, we may be unable to do so in the short term (or at all) at prices or quality levels that are acceptable to us. In addition, we could experience delays if our suppliers do not meet agreed upon timelines or experience capacity constraints. Any disruption in the supply of components, whether or not from a single source supplier, could temporarily disrupt production of our vehicles until an alternative supplier is able to supply the required material. Changes in business conditions, unforeseen circumstances, governmental changes, and other factors beyond our control or which we do not presently anticipate, could also affect our suppliers ability to deliver components to us on a timely basis. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and prospects. If any of our suppliers become economically distressed or go bankrupt, we may be required to provide substantial financial support or take other measures to ensure supplies of components or materials, which could increase our costs, affect our liquidity or cause production disruptions. We expect to purchase various types of equipment, raw materials and manufactured component parts from our suppliers. If these suppliers experience substantial financial difficulties, cease operations, or otherwise face business disruptions, we may be required to provide substantial financial support to ensure supply continuity or would have to take other measures to ensure components and materials remain available. Any disruption could affect our ability to deliver vehicles and could increase our costs and negatively affect our liquidity and financial performance.

 We have a limited operating history and face significant challenges as a new entrant into the automotive industry, our vehicles are in development, and we do not expect our first vehicle to be produced until the second quarter of 2024, at the earliest, if at all. We have a short operating history in the automobile industry, which is continuously evolving. We have no experience as an organization in high volume manufacturing of the planned EVs. We cannot assure you that us or our partners will be able to develop efficient, automated, cost-efficient manufacturing capability and processes, and reliable sources of component supplies that will enable us to meet the quality, price, engineering, design and production standards, as well as the production volumes, required to successfully mass-market future vehicles. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and significant challenges we face as a new entrant into our industry, including, among other things, with respect to our ability to: design and produce safe, reliable and quality vehicles on an ongoing basis; obtain the necessary regulatory approvals in a timely manner; build a well-recognized and respected brand; establish and expand our customer base; properly price our services, including our charging solutions, financing and lease options, and successfully anticipate the take-rate and usage of such services by users; successfully service our vehicles after sales and maintain a good flow of spare parts and customer goodwill; improve and maintain our operational efficiency; maintain a reliable, secure, high-performance and scalable technology infrastructure; predict our future revenues and appropriately budget for our expenses; attract, retain and motivate talented employees; anticipate trends that may emerge and affect our business; anticipate and adapt to changing market conditions, including technological developments and changes in competitive landscape; navigate an evolving and complex regulatory environment. 
 If we fail to adequately address any or all of these risks and challenges, our business may be materially and adversely affected. We are an early-stage company with a history of losses and expect to incur significant expenses and continuing losses for the foreseeable future. There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have incurred a net loss since our inception. We believe that we will continue to incur operating and net losses each quarter until at least the time we begin significant deliveries of our vehicles. Even if we are able to successfully develop, manufacture, and sell or lease our vehicles, there can be no assurance that they will be commercially successful. We expect the rate at which we will incur losses to be significantly higher in future periods as we, among other things: design, develop and manufacture our vehicles; build up inventories of parts and components for our vehicles; increase our sales and marketing activities, including opening new Mullen Experience Centers; develop our distribution infrastructure; 
 31

 and increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations. We may find that these efforts are more expensive than we currently anticipate or that these efforts may not result in revenues, which would further increase our losses. Our independent registered public accounting firm has included an emphasis of matter paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern in its opinion on our September 30, 2022, consolidated financial statements due to our lack of revenues and insufficient capital for us to fund our operations. Our business model has yet to be tested and any failure to commercialize our strategic plans would have an adverse effect on our operating results and business, harm our reputation and could result in substantial liabilities that exceed our resources. Investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by a new enterprise, many of which are beyond our control, including substantial risks and expenses while establishing or entering new markets, setting up operations and undertaking marketing activities. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of these risks, expenses, complications, delays, and the competitive environment in which we operate. There is, therefore, nothing at this time upon which to base an assumption that our business model will prove successful, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue, raise additional capital or operate profitably. We will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by early commercial stage companies, including scaling up our infrastructure and headcount, and may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties or delays in connection with our growth. In addition, as a result of the capital-intensive nature of our business, we can be expected to continue to sustain substantial operating expenses without generating sufficient revenues to cover expenditure. Any investment in our company is therefore highly speculative and could result in the loss of your entire investment. We may not be able to accurately estimate the supply and demand for our vehicles, which could result in a variety of inefficiencies in our business and hinder our ability to generate revenue. If we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements, we could incur additional costs or experience delays. It is difficult to predict our future revenues and appropriate budget for our expenses, and we may have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. We will be required to provide forecasts of our demand to our suppliers several months prior to the scheduled delivery of products to our prospective customers. Currently, there is no historical basis for making judgments on the demand for our vehicles or our ability to develop, manufacture, and deliver vehicles, or our profitability in the future. If we overestimate our requirements, our suppliers may have excess inventory, which indirectly would increase our costs. If we underestimate our requirements, our suppliers may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt the manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and revenues. In addition, lead times for materials and components that our suppliers order may vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, contract terms and demand for each component at a given time. If we fail to order sufficient quantities of product components in a timely manner, the delivery of vehicles to our customers could be delayed, which would harm our business, financial condition and operating results. We could experience cost increases or disruptions in the supply of raw materials or other components used in our vehicles. If we are unable to establish an arrangement for the sustainable supply of batteries for our vehicles, our business would be materially and adversely harmed. We may be unable to adequately control the costs associated with our operations. We expect to incur significant costs related to procuring raw materials required to manufacture and assemble our vehicles. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on factors beyond our control. Our business also depends on the continued supply of battery cells for our vehicles. We are exposed to multiple risks relating to availability and pricing of quality solid-state polymer battery cells and lithium-ion battery cells. Furthermore, currency fluctuations, tariffs or shortages in petroleum and other economic or political conditions may result in significant increases in freight charges and raw material costs. Substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials or components would increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins. In addition, a growth in popularity of 
 32 

Table of Contents 
 electric vehicles without a significant expansion in battery cell production capacity could result in shortages, which would result in increased costs in raw materials to us or impact our prospects. If our vehicles fail to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market, and sell or lease our electric vehicles could be harmed. Once production commences, our vehicles may contain defects in design and manufacture that may cause them not to perform as expected or that may require repair, recalls, and design changes. Our vehicles will use a substantial amount of software code to operate, and software products are inherently complex and often contain defects and errors when first introduced. We have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate the long-term performance of our systems and vehicles. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in the vehicles prior to their sale to consumers. If any of our vehicles fail to perform as expected, we may need to delay deliveries or initiate product recalls, which could adversely affect our brand in our target markets and could adversely affect our business, prospects, and results of operations. Our services may not be generally accepted by our users. If we are unable to provide quality customer service, our business and reputation may be materially and adversely affected. Our servicing may primarily be carried out through third parties certified by us. Although such servicing partners may have experience in servicing other vehicles, they will initially have limited experience in servicing our vehicles. There can be no assurance that our service arrangements will adequately address the service requirements of our customers to their satisfaction, or that us or any of our proposed service partners will have sufficient resources to meet these service requirements in a timely manner as the volume of vehicles we deliver increases. The automotive market is highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in this industry. Both the automobile industry generally, and the electric vehicle segment, in particular, are highly competitive, and we will be competing for sales with both internal combustion engine ICE vehicles and other EVs. Many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products, including their electric vehicles. We expect competition for electric vehicles to intensify due to increased demand and a regulatory push for alternative fuel vehicles, continuing globalization, and consolidation in the worldwide automotive industry. Factors affecting competition include product quality and features, innovation and development time, pricing, reliability, safety, fuel economy, customer service, and financing terms. Increased competition may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in downward price pressure and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. The automotive industry and our technology are rapidly evolving and may be subject to unforeseen changes. Developments in alternative technologies, including but not limited to hydrogen, may adversely affect the demand for our electric vehicles. We may be unable to keep up with changes in EV technology or alternatives to electricity as a fuel source and, as a result, our competitiveness may suffer. Developments in alternative technologies, such as advanced diesel, ethanol, fuel cells, or compressed natural gas, or improvements in the fuel economy of the ICE, may materially and adversely affect our business and prospects in ways we do not currently anticipate. Any failure by us to successfully react to changes in existing technologies could materially harm our competitive position and growth prospects. We may be subject to risks associated with autonomous driving technology. It is expected that our proposed vehicles will be designed with connectivity for future installation of an autonomous hardware suite, and we plan to partner with a third-party software provider in the future to implement autonomous capabilities. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify a third party to provide the necessary hardware and software to enable autonomous capabilities in an acceptable timeframe, on terms satisfactory to us, or at all. Autonomous driving technologies are subject to risks and there have been accidents and fatalities associated with such 
 33 

Table of Contents 
 technologies. The safety of such technologies depends in part on driving interactions, and drivers may not be accustomed to using or adapting to such technologies. To the extent accidents associated with our autonomous driving systems occur, we could be subject to liability, negative publicity, government scrutiny, and further regulation. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects. Our distribution model is different from the predominant current distribution model for automobile manufacturers, which makes evaluating our business, operating results and future prospects difficult. Our distribution model is different from the predominant current distribution model for automobile manufacturers, which makes evaluating our business, operating results and future prospects difficult. Our distribution model is not common in the automotive industry today. We plan to conduct vehicle sales directly to users rather than through dealerships. This model of vehicle distribution is relatively new and, with limited exceptions, unproven, and subjects us to substantial risk. For example, we will not be able to utilize long-established sales channels developed through a franchise system to increase sales volume. Moreover, we will be competing with companies with well-established distribution channels. Our success will depend in large part on our ability to effectively develop our own sales channels and marketing strategies. If we are unable to achieve this, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial results and results of operations. We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in our failure to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management is working to remediate our current material weaknesses and prevent potential future material weaknesses by hiring additional qualified accounting and financial reporting personnel, and further reviewing and enhancing our accounting processes. We may not be able to fully remediate any future material weaknesses until these steps have been completed and have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. If we are not able to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our financial statements and related disclosures may be inaccurate, which could have materially adverse effects on our business and our stock price. Our future growth is dependent on the demand for, and upon consumers willingness to adopt, electric vehicles. Our future growth is dependent on the demand for, and upon consumers willingness to adopt electric vehicles, and even if electric vehicles become more mainstream, consumers choosing us over other EV manufacturers. Demand for electric vehicles may be affected by factors directly impacting automobile prices or the cost of purchasing and operating automobiles such as sales and financing incentives, prices of raw materials and parts and components, cost of fuel and governmental regulations, including tariffs, import regulation and other taxes. Volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sales, which may result in downward price pressure and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, the demand for our vehicles and services will highly depend upon the adoption by consumers of new energy vehicles in general and electric vehicles in particular. The market for new energy vehicles is still rapidly evolving, characterized by rapidly changing technologies, competitive pricing and competitive factors, evolving government regulation and industry standards, and changing consumer demands and behaviors. Other factors that may influence the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles, and specifically electric vehicles, include: perceptions about EV quality, safety, design, performance and cost, especially if adverse events or accidents occur that are linked to the quality or safety of electric vehicles, whether or not such vehicles are produced by us or other manufacturers; range anxiety;

 the availability of new energy vehicles, including plug-in hybrid EVs; the availability of service and charging stations for EVs; the environmental consciousness of consumers, and their adoption of EVs; perceptions about and the actual cost of alternative fuel; and macroeconomic factors. 
 Any of the factors described above may cause current or potential customers not to purchase EVs in general, and our EVs in particular. If the market for EVs does not develop as we expect or develops more slowly than we expect, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be affected. The unavailability, reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Any reduction, elimination, or discriminatory application of government subsidies and economic incentives because of policy changes, or the reduced need for such subsidies and incentives due to the perceived success of the electric vehicle or for other reasons, may result in the diminished competitiveness of the alternative fuel and electric vehicle industry generally or our electric vehicles in particular. This could materially and adversely affect the growth of the alternative fuel automobile markets and our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. While certain tax credits and other incentives for alternative energy production, alternative fuel and electric vehicles have been available in the past, there is no guarantee these programs will be available in the future. If current tax incentives are not available in the future, our financial position could be harmed. In addition, we may apply for federal and state grants, loans and tax incentives under government programs designed to stimulate the economy and support the production of alternative fuel and electric vehicles and related technologies, and our ability to obtain funds or incentives from government sources is subject to the availability of funds under applicable government programs and approval of our applications to participate in such programs. The application process for these funds and other incentives will likely be highly competitive. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining any of these additional grants, loans and other incentives. If we are not successful in obtaining any of these additional incentives and we are unable to find alternative sources of funding to meet our planned capital needs, our business and prospects could be materially adversely affected. If we fail to manage our future growth effectively, we may not be able to develop, manufacture, market and sell or lease our vehicles successfully. We intend to expand our operations significantly, which will require hiring, retaining and training new personnel, controlling expenses, establishing facilities and experience centers, and implementing administrative infrastructure, systems and processes. In addition, because our electric vehicles are based on a different technology platform than traditional ICE vehicles, individuals with sufficient training in electric vehicles may not be available to be hired, and we will need to expend significant time and expense training employees we hire. We also require sufficient talent in additional areas such as software development. Furthermore, as we are a relatively young company, our ability to train and integrate new employees into our operations may not meet the growing demands of our business, which may affect our ability to grow. Any failure to effectively manage our growth could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. For example, to manage the expected growth of our operations and increasing complexity, we will need to improve our operational and financial systems, procedures, and controls and continue to increase systems automation to reduce reliance on manual operations. Any inability to do so will affect our billing and reporting. Our current and planned systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our complex arrangements and the rules governing revenue and

 expense recognition for our future operations and expected growth. Delays or problems associated with any improvement or expansion of our operational and financial systems and controls could adversely affect our relationships with our customers, cause harm to our reputation and brand and could also result in errors in our financial and other reporting. Insufficient warranty reserves to cover future warranty claims could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Once our cars are in production, we will need to maintain warranty reserves to cover warranty-related claims. If our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our vehicles, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. We may become subject to significant and unexpected warranty expenses. There can be no assurances that then-existing warranty reserves will be sufficient to cover all claims. We may not succeed in establishing, maintaining and strengthening the Mullen brand, which would materially and adversely affect customer acceptance of our vehicles and components and our business, revenues and prospects. Once our cars are in production, our business and prospects will heavily depend on our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen the Mullen brand. If we are not able to establish, maintain and strengthen our brand, we may lose the opportunity to build a critical mass of customers. Our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen the Mullen brand will depend heavily on the success of our marketing efforts. The automobile industry is intensely competitive, and we may not be successful in building, maintaining and strengthening our brand. Many of our current and potential competitors, particularly automobile manufacturers headquartered in the United States, Japan, the European Union and China, have greater name recognition, broader customer relationships and substantially greater marketing resources than we do. If we do not develop and maintain a strong brand, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely impacted. Doing business internationally creates operational and financial risks for our business. Our business plan includes eventual expansion into other international markets. Conducting and launching operations on an international scale requires close coordination of activities across multiple jurisdictions and time zones and consumes significant management resources. If we fail to coordinate and manage these activities effectively, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. International sales entail a variety of risks, including currency exchange fluctuations, challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations, tariffs and other trade barriers, unexpected changes in legislative or regulatory requirements of foreign countries into which we sell our products and services, difficulties in obtaining export licenses or in overcoming other trade barriers, laws and business practices favoring local companies, political and economic instability, difficulties protecting or procuring intellectual property rights, and restrictions resulting in delivery delays and significant taxes or other burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws. We are highly dependent on the services of David Michery, our Chief Executive Officer. We are highly dependent on the services of David Michery, our founder and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Michery is the source of many, if not most, of the ideas and execution driving us. If Mr. Michery were to discontinue his service to us due to death, disability or any other reason, we would be significantly disadvantaged. Our business may be adversely affected by labor and union activities. Although none of our employees are currently represented by a labor union, it is common throughout the automobile industry generally for many employees at automobile companies to belong to a union, which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. We may also directly and indirectly depend upon other companies with unionized work forces, such as parts suppliers and trucking and freight companies, and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or operating results.

 We face risks related to health epidemics, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We face various risks related to public health issues, including epidemics, pandemics, and other outbreaks, including the recent pandemic of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus known as COVID-19. The impact of COVID-19, including changes in consumer and business behavior, pandemic fears and market downturns, and restrictions on business and individual activities, has created significant volatility in the global economy and led to reduced economic activity. The spread of COVID-19 has also created a disruption in the manufacturing, delivery and overall supply chain of vehicle manufacturers and suppliers and has led to a global decrease in vehicle sales in markets around the world. The pandemic has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders, and business shutdowns. These measures may adversely impact our employees and operations and the operations of our customers, suppliers, vendors and business partners, and may negatively impact our sales and marketing activities. In addition, various aspects of our business cannot be conducted remotely. These measures by government authorities may remain in place for a significant period of time and they are likely to continue to adversely affect our manufacturing plans, sales and marketing activities, business and results of operations. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, recommending that all non-essential personnel work from home and cancellation or reduction of physical participation in sales activities, meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers, vendors and business partners. The reduction of economic activity also disrupted some contractual obligations due to work stoppage requirements. Some employees chose the option to work from home rather than come to the office. As a result, there were some reductions in employee productivity, employee layoffs and employee salaries. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, prospects and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, our severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat our impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating activities can resume. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience an adverse impact to our business as a result of our global economic impact, including any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. Specifically, difficult macroeconomic conditions, such as decreases in per capita income and level of disposable income, increased and prolonged unemployment, or a decline in consumer confidence as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our vehicles. Under difficult economic conditions, potential customers may seek to reduce spending by forgoing our vehicles for other traditional options or may choose to keep their existing vehicles and cancel reservations. There are no comparable recent events that may provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of COVID-19 and a pandemic, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain. Reservations for our vehicles are cancellable. The potentially long wait from the time a reservation is made until the time the vehicle is delivered, and any delays beyond expected wait times, could impact user decisions on whether to ultimately make a purchase. Any cancellations could harm our financial condition, business, prospects, and operating results. We may face legal challenges in one or more states attempting to sell directly to customers which could materially adversely affect our costs. Our business plan includes the direct sale of vehicles to business customers, and potentially, to individual customers. Most, if not all, states require a license to sell vehicles within the state. Many states prohibit manufacturers from directly selling 
 37 

Table of Contents 
 vehicles to customers. In other states, manufacturers must operate a physical dealership within the state to deliver vehicles to customers. As a result, we may not be able to sell directly to customers in each state in the United States. For customers residing in states in which we will not be allowed to sell or deliver vehicles, we may have to arrange alternate methods of delivery of vehicles. This could include delivering vehicles to adjacent or nearby states in which we are allowed to directly sell and ship vehicles and arranging for the customer to transport the vehicles to their home states. These workarounds could add significant complexity, and as a result, costs, to our business. Failure of information security and privacy concerns could subject us to penalties, damage our reputation and brand, and harm our business and results of operations. We expect to face significant challenges with respect to information security and privacy, including the storage, transmission and sharing of confidential information. We will transmit and store confidential and private information of our customers, such as personal information, including names, accounts, user IDs and passwords, and payment or transaction related information. We have adopted information security policies and deployed measures to implement the policies, including, among others, encryption technologies, and plans to continue to deploy additional measures as we grow. However, advances in technology, an increased level of sophistication and diversity of our products and services, an increased level of expertise of hackers, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other factors can still result in a compromise or breach of the measures that we use. If we are unable to protect our systems, and hence the information stored in our systems, from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction, such problems or security breaches could cause a loss, give rise to our liabilities to the owners of confidential information or even subject us to fines and penalties. In addition, complying with various laws and regulations could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices, including our data practices, in a manner adverse to our business. In addition, we will need to comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR ), which became effective on May 25, 2018, and the State of California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 CCPA ). Both the GDPR and the CCPA impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provide certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored. Compliance with existing, proposed and recently enacted laws (including implementation of the privacy and process enhancements called for under the GDPR) and regulations can be costly; any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks. Compliance with any additional laws and regulations could be expensive and may place restrictions on the conduct of our business and the manner in which we interact with our customers. Any failure to comply with applicable regulations could also result in regulatory enforcement actions against us, and misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against us by governmental entities or others, and damage to our reputation and credibility, and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits. Significant capital and other resources may be required to protect against information security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches or to comply with our privacy policies or privacy-related legal obligations. The resources required may increase over time as the methods used by hackers and others engaged in online criminal activities are increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving. Any failure or perceived failure by us to prevent information security breaches or to comply with privacy policies or privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other customer data, could cause our customers to lose trust in us and could expose us to legal claims. Any perception by the public that online transactions or the privacy of user information are becoming increasingly unsafe or vulnerable to attacks could inhibit the growth of online retail and other online services generally, which may reduce the number of orders we receive.

 We may need to defend ourselves against patent or trademark infringement claims, and we may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our intellectual property, which may be time-consuming and would cause us to incur substantial costs and harm our business and competitive position. Companies, organizations, or individuals, including our competitors, may hold or obtain patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, develop, sell, lease or market our vehicles or components, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business. From time to time, we may receive communications from holders of patents or trademarks regarding their proprietary rights. Companies holding patents or other intellectual property rights may bring suits alleging infringement of such rights or otherwise assert their rights and urge us to take licenses. Our applications and uses of trademarks relating to our design, software or artificial intelligence technologies could be found to infringe upon existing trademark ownership and rights. In addition, if we are determined to have infringed upon a third party s intellectual property rights, we may be required to do one or more of the following: cease selling or leasing, incorporating certain components into, or using vehicles or offering goods or services that incorporate or use the challenged intellectual property; pay substantial damages; seek a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all; redesign our vehicles or other goods or services; or establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services. 
 In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to obtain a license to the infringed technology or other intellectual property right, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs, negative publicity and diversion of resources and management attention. Further, we may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our intellectual property, which could harm our business and competitive position. We rely or will rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets (including know-how), employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, copyrights, trademarks, intellectual property licenses, and other contractual rights to establish and protect our rights in our technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, third parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property or seek court declarations that they do not infringe upon our intellectual property rights. Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly, and the steps we have taken or will take may not prevent misappropriation. From time to time, we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. Patent, trademark, and trade secret laws vary significantly throughout the world. A number of foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Therefore, our intellectual property rights may not be as strong or as easily enforced outside of the United States. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which, would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

 Patent applications that we may file may not issue as patents and any patents that may be granted to us may expire and may not be extended, our rights may be contested, circumvented, invalidated or limited in scope, or our rights may not protect us effectively, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to prevent others from commercially exploiting products similar to theirs. We cannot be certain that we are the first inventor of the subject matter to which we may file a particular patent application, or if we are the first party to file such a patent application. If another party has filed a patent application for the same subject matter as we have, we may not be entitled to the protection sought by the patent application. Further, the scope of protection of issued patent claims is often difficult to determine. As a result, we cannot be certain that the patent applications that we file will issue, or that our issued patents will afford protection against competitors with similar technology. In addition, our competitors may design around our issued patents, which may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results. We cannot assure you that we will be granted patents pursuant to any applications that we may file. Even if we file patent applications and we are issued patents in accordance with them, it is still uncertain whether these patents will be contested, circumvented or invalidated in the future. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with meaningful protection or competitive advantages. The claims under any patents that are issued from our patent applications may not be broad enough to prevent others from developing technologies that are similar or that achieve results similar to ours. The intellectual property rights of others could also bar us from licensing and exploiting any patents that are issued from our applications. Numerous patents and pending patent applications owned by others exist in the fields in which we have developed and are developing our technology. These patents and patent applications might have priority over our patent applications and could subject our patent applications to invalidation. Finally, in addition to those who may claim priority, any of our patents may also be challenged by others on the basis that they are otherwise invalid or unenforceable. We may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our employees former employers. Many of our employees were previously employed by other automotive companies or by suppliers to automotive companies. We may be subject to claims that we or these employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize our products, which could severely harm our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and demand on management resources. Our vehicles are subject to motor vehicle standards and substantial regulation, and the failure to satisfy such mandated safety standards or regulations, or unfavorable changes to such regulations, would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. All vehicles sold must comply with international, federal, and state motor vehicle safety standards. In the United States, vehicles that meet or exceed all federally mandated safety standards are certified under the federal regulations. Rigorous testing and the use of approved materials and equipment are among the requirements for achieving federal certification. Failure by us to have our future model electric vehicle satisfy motor vehicle standards would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Additionally, our electric vehicles, and the sale of motor vehicles in general, are subject to substantial regulation under international, federal, state, and local laws. We expect to incur significant costs in complying with these regulations. Regulations related to the electric vehicle industry and alternative energy are currently evolving and we face risks associated with changes to these regulations. To the extent the laws change, our vehicles may not comply with applicable international, federal, state or local laws, which would have an adverse effect on our business. Compliance with changing regulations could be burdensome, time consuming, and expensive. To the extent compliance with new regulations is cost prohibitive, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected.

 Internationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time. Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell or lease vehicles directly to consumers could have a negative and material impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. We may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims. We may become subject to product liability claims, even those without merit, which could harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. The automobile industry experiences significant product liability claims and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform as expected or malfunction resulting in personal injury or death. Our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given we have limited field experience for our vehicles. A successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award. Moreover, a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our vehicles and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other future vehicle candidates, which would have material adverse effect on our brand, business, prospects and operating results. Any insurance coverage might not be sufficient to cover all potential product liability claims. Any lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages either in excess of our coverage, or outside of our coverage, may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial condition. We may not be able to secure additional product liability insurance coverage on commercially acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed, particularly if we do face liability for our products and are forced to make a claim under our policy. We are or will be subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, financial and economic sanctions and similar laws, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties, collateral consequences, remedial measures and legal expenses, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation. We are or will be subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, financial and economic sanctions and similar laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which we conduct or in the future may conduct activities, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA ), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and other anti-corruption laws and regulations. The FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 prohibit us and our officers, directors, employees and business partners acting on our behalf, including agents, from corruptly offering, promising, authorizing or providing anything of value to a foreign official for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA also requires companies to make and keep books, records and accounts that accurately reflect transactions and dispositions of assets and to maintain a system of adequate internal accounting controls. The U.K. Bribery Act also prohibit non-governmental commercial bribery and soliciting or accepting bribes. A violation of these laws or regulations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation. Our policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations may not be sufficient and our directors, officers, employees, representatives, consultants, agents, and business partners could engage in improper conduct for which we may be held responsible. Non-compliance with anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering or financial and economic sanctions laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, and severe administrative, civil and criminal sanctions, collateral consequences, remedial measures and legal expenses, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation. In addition, changes in economic sanctions laws in the future could adversely impact our business and investments in our shares. Failure to improve our operational and financial systems to support our expected growth, increasingly complex business arrangements and rules governing revenue and expense recognition and any inability to do so will adversely affect our billing and reporting. To manage the expected growth and increasing complexity of our operations, we will need to improve our operational and financial systems, procedures, and controls and continue to increase systems automation to reduce reliance on manual operations. Any inability to do so will affect our billing and reporting. Our current and planned systems, procedures and

 controls may not be adequate to support our complex arrangements and the rules governing revenue and expense recognition for our future operations and expected growth. Delays or problems associated with any improvement or expansion of our operational and financial systems and controls could adversely affect our relationships with our customers, cause harm to our reputation and brand and could also result in errors in our financial and other reporting. Failure to build our finance infrastructure and improve our accounting systems and controls could impair our ability to comply with the financial reporting and internal controls requirements for publicly traded companies. As a public company, we will operate in an increasingly demanding regulatory environment, which requires us to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ), the regulations of the Nasdaq CM, the rules and regulations of the SEC, expanded disclosure requirements, accelerated reporting requirements and more complex accounting rules. Company responsibilities required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act include establishing corporate oversight and adequate internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud. The Company must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in our Form 10-K filing. Prior to the Closing, we have never been required to test our internal controls within a specified period and, as a result, we may experience difficulty in meeting these reporting requirements in a timely manner. We anticipate that the process of building our accounting and financial functions and infrastructure will require significant additional professional fees, internal costs and management efforts. We expect that we will need to implement a new internal system to combine and streamline the management of our financial, accounting, human resources and other functions. However, such a system would likely require us to complete many processes and procedures for the effective use of the system or to run our business using the system, which may result in substantial costs. Any disruptions or difficulties in implementing or using such a system could adversely affect our controls and harm our business. Moreover, such disruption or difficulties could result in unanticipated costs and diversion of management s attention. In addition, we may discover additional weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and results of operations could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the Nasdaq CM, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. All of our debt obligations and our senior equity securities will have priority over our Common Stock with respect to payment in the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and our outstanding senior securities restrict our ability to pay dividends on our Common Stock. If we were to liquidate, dissolve or wind up, our Common Stock would rank below all debt claims against us and claims of all of our outstanding shares of preferred stock. As a result, holders of Common Stock of the combined company will not be entitled to receive any payment or other distribution of assets upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the combined company until after all our obligations to our debt holders have been satisfied and holders of senior equity securities have received any payment or distribution due to them. In addition, our Certificate of Incorporation currently requires us to pay substantial monthly dividends on our Series C Preferred in cash or in stock. Although we can pay such an amount in shares of our Common Stock, the issuance of additional shares may dilute the Company s equity and adversely affect the trading price of the shares of our Common Stock.

 If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our Common Stock will depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Currently, we do not have any analyst coverage and may not obtain analyst coverage in the future. In the event we obtain analyst coverage, we will not have any control over such analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. Not applicable. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. Our corporate headquarters is in Brea, CA, where we occupy approximately 24,730 rentable square feet under a sublease that expires in March 2026 with lease payments of 33,136 per month. We use this space primarily for our senior management, technology, product design, sales and marketing, finance, legal, human resources, general administrative and information technology teams. On August 1, 2022, the Company announced the opening of its Automotive Development Center in Irvine, CA. The 16,000 square foot facility houses the Automotive Team, which includes Engineering Design and Development, Styling, Program Management, Marketing and Finance. In August 2022, the lease was modified to include the second floor of the building. The leased space increased to 31,603 square feet, and the lease payments are approximately 75,000 per month which includes rent, insurance, and CAM. Our Battery Innovation Center BIC located in Monrovia, CA. We lease 71,753 square foot space to house the following areas: Battery, Powertrain, Thermal, and Infotainment teams. Lease payments are 71,447 per month. We own the manufacturing facility located in Robinsonville, Tunica County, MS, which was purchased in November 2021. The Advanced Manufacturing Engineering Center AMEC is 124,000 square foot engineering facility on 100 acres. On November 30, 2022, the Company purchased an automobile manufacturing facility in Mishawaka, St. Joseph County, IN as part of the ELMS asset acquisition. The site gross area is 1,392,395 square feet. The Mishawaka assembly plant consists of a body shop, paint shop, general assembly area, and water treatment plant. The Company leases 31,002 square feet of office space in Troy, MI. The lease payments are 21,750 per month; however, the payments will increase to 22,750 per month, beginning January 2023. The Detroit EV Team is comprised of Engineering and Technology Teams. Bollinger Motors maintains its offices within a 36,300 square foot building located in Oak Park, MI and has operated at this facility since August 2020. The lease payments for this facility were approximately 25,000 per month during 2022. Bollinger Motors recently entered into a new five-year lease agreement for this Oak Park facility which will become effective January 1, 2023 with initial lease payments of approximately 27,000 per month. Additionally, Bollinger Motors still maintains a lease in Ferndale, MI from where the company previously operated prior to August 2020. The lease payments for this facility were approximately 6,000 per month in 2022. However, the Ferndale facility was subleased for the entirety of 2022 with sublease income of approximately 7,000 per month. The sublease is in place until October 2024 when this lease is set to expire.

 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. Mullen Technologies, Inc. v. Qiantu Motor (Suzhou) Ltd. This claim was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California Case No. 3:19-cv-01979-W-DEB on October 11, 2019. This matter arises out of a contract dispute between Mullen and Qiantu related to the engineering, design, support, and homologation of Qiantu s K50 vehicle by Mullen. On July 1, 2020, the court ordered this matter to arbitration. It was submitted to the American Arbitration Association on February 9, 2021, for arbitration in Denver, Colorado.

Market Information Our Common Stock began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol NETE on October 3, 2012. In connection with the reverse merger, the ticker symbol for the Company s Common Stock changed from NETE to MULN at the opening of trading on November 5, 2021. Holders As of September 30, 2022, our Common Stock was held by 811 registered shareholders of record. The number of record holders was determined from the records of our transfer agent and does not include beneficial owners of Common Stock whose shares are held in the names of various securities brokers, dealers and registered clearing agencies. Our transfer agent is Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company. Dividends We have not historically declared any dividends. We have no present intention of paying any cash dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future, as any earnings will be used to help generate growth. The decision on the payment of dividends in the future rests within the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, our earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as other relevant factors. There are no restrictions in our certificate of incorporation or bylaws that restrict us from declaring dividends. Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans The information included under Item 12 of Part III of this Report is hereby incorporated by reference into Item 5 of Part II of this Report. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities Sale of Unregistered Securities Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities For the three months ended September 30, 2022, we did not repurchase any shares of our Common Stock. ITEM 6. [RESERVED] ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Report. This discussion and analysis contain forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the heading Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Report. Certain amounts in this section may not foot due to rounding. In connection with the Merger Agreement (as defined below), and as disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 12, 2021, our fiscal year end has changed from December 31 to September 30, effective for

Table of Contents 
 our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. As a result, and unless otherwise indicated , references to our fiscal year 2022 and prior years mean the fiscal year ended on September 30 of such year. Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Mullen Investment Properties, LLC, and its 60 owned subsidiary, Bollinger Motors. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated, if any. The financial statements reflect the consolidated financial position and results of operations of Mullen, which have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States As a result, we expect that the financial results of our reports for the periods after we begin commercial operations will not be comparable to the financial results included in this Annual Report. Components of Results of Operations We are an early-stage company, and our historical results may not be indicative of our future results for reasons that may be difficult to anticipate. Accordingly, the drivers of our future financial results, as well as the components of such results, may not be comparable to our historical or projected results of operations. Revenues We do not currently generate any revenue. Once we commence production and commercialization of our vehicles, we expect that most of our revenue will be initially derived from direct sales of cargo vans, Class 4 through 6 delivery vehicles, and Sport Utility Vehicles SUVs ). Cost of Goods Sold To date, we have not recorded cost of goods sold, as we have not recorded commercial revenue. Once we commence the commercial production and sale of our EVs, we expect cost of goods sold to include mainly vehicle components and parts, including batteries, direct labor costs, amortized tooling costs, and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative G A expenses include all non-production expenses incurred by us in any given period. This includes expenses such as professional fees, salaries, rent, repairs and maintenance, utilities and office expense, employee benefits, depreciation and amortization, advertising and marketing, settlements and penalties, taxes, licenses and other expenses. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in G A expenses. We expense advertising costs as incurred in accordance with ASC 720-35, Other Expenses Advertising Cost. Research and Development Expense To date, our research and development expenses have consisted primarily of external engineering services in connection with the design of our initial EV and development of the first prototype. As we ramp up for commercial operations, we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase for the foreseeable future as we expand our hiring of engineers and designers and continues to invest in new vehicle model design and development of technology. Income Tax Expense / Benefit Our income tax provision consists of an estimate for U.S. federal and state income taxes based on enacted rates, as adjusted for allowable credits, deductions, uncertain tax positions, changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in the tax law. We maintain a valuation allowance against the full value of our U.S. and state net deferred tax assets because we believe the recoverability of the tax assets is not more likely than not.

During the year, there was minimal activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Research and Development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses primarily consist of the Mullen FIVE EV show car development and are primarily comprised of personnel-related costs for employees and consultants. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased by approximately 55.9 million or 288 from approximately 19.4 million in the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, to approximately 75.3 million in the twelve months ended September 30,

 2022, primarily due to increases in professional services, marketing, and payroll related expenses with the growth of personnel and resources. Interest Expense Interest expense increased by approximately 5.8 million or 27 from approximately 21.2 million through the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, to approximately 26.9 million through the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to an increase in convertible debt. Gain on extinguishment of debt During November 2020, the U.S. Small Business Administration SBA approved the CARES Act loan forgiveness amount of 875,426 in principal and accrued interest on November 20, 2020. Net Loss Net loss was 740.3 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, an increase of 696.1 million or 1,573 from 44.2 million in the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. Liquidity and Capital Resources To date, we have yet to generate any revenue from our business operations. We have funded our capital expenditure and working capital requirements through the sale of equity and debt securities, as further discussed below. Our ability to successfully commence commercial operations and expand our business will depend on many factors, including our working capital needs, the availability of equity or debt financing and, over time, our ability to generate cash flows from operations. As of September 30, 2022, our cash, restricted cash and cash equivalents amounted to approximately 84.4 million and our total debt amounted to approximately 9.0 million. Debt To date, our current working capital and development needs have been primarily funded through the issuance of convertible indebtedness, convertible preferred stock and Common Stock. Short-term debt comprises a component of our funding needs. Short-term debt is generally defined as debt with principal maturities of one-year or less. Long-term debt is defined as principal maturities of one year or more. Short and Long-Term Debt The short-term debt classification primarily is based upon loans due within twelve-months from the balance sheet date, in addition to loans that have matured and remain unpaid. Management plans to renegotiate matured loans with creditors for favorable terms, such as reduce interest rate, extend maturities, or both; however, there is no guarantee favorable terms will be reached. Until negotiations with creditors are resolved, these matured loans remain outstanding and will be classified within short-term debt on the balance sheet. Interest and fees on loans are being accounted for within accrued interest. The loans are secured by substantially all the Company s assets. Several principal shareholders have provided loans to and hold convertible debt of the Company and are related parties.

Years Ended September 30, Net cash provided by (used in): 2022 2021 Operating activities (65,795,610) (17,522,115) Investing activities (47,154,109) (161,783) Financing activities 197,282,630 17,692,704 Cash Flows used in Operating Activities Our cash flow used in operating activities to date has been primarily comprised of costs related to research and development, payroll and other general and administrative activities. As we continue to ramp up hiring ahead of starting commercial operations, we expect our cash used in operating activities to increase significantly before we start to generate any material cash flow from our business. Net cash used in operating activities was 65.8 million in the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, an increase from 17.5 million net cash used in the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. Net losses for the year ended September 30, 2022, were 740.3 million offset by non-cash operating activities of 484.4 million financing loss on warrants and 122.8 on revaluation of warrant liabilities. Stock based compensation for employees, directors and consultants totaled 43.7 million. Cash Flows used in Investing Activities Our cash flows used in investing activities, to date, have been comprised mainly of purchases of equipment and have not been material. We expect these costs to increase substantially in the near future as we ramp up activity ahead of commencing commercial operations. Net cash used in investing activities was 47.1 million in the year ended September 30, 2022, a decrease from 0.2 million used in investing activities the year ended September 30, 2021. The primary factor in the increased cash outflows was the Bollinger Motors acquisition. Cash Flows provided by Financing Activities Through September 30, 2022, we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of convertible notes and equity securities. Net cash provided by financing activities was 197.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 primarily due to issuance of preferred shares, as compared to 17.7 million net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2021, which included (i) 12.2 million net proceeds from issuance of notes payable; (ii) 42.3 million in net proceeds from issuance of Common Stock; (iii) 142.9million in proceeds to issue Preferred C and D shares.

Years Ended September 30, 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total Total Debt 3,856,497 5,164,552 9,021,049 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In the preparation of these financial statements, our management is required to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Management considers an accounting judgment, estimate or assumption to be critical when (1) the estimate or assumption is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (2) the use of different judgments, estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Stock-Based Compensation and Common Stock Valuation We recognize the cost of share-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the estimated grant-date fair value of the awards. Cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. Our management reverses previously recognized costs for unvested options in the period that forfeitures occur. Mullen determines the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is impacted by the following assumptions: Expected Term We use the simplified method when calculating the expected term due to insufficient historical exercise data. 
 52 

Table of Contents 
 Expected Volatility As our shares were not actively traded during the periods presented, the volatility is based on a benchmark of comparable companies within the automotive and energy storage industries. Expected Dividend Yield The dividend rate used is zero as we have never paid any cash dividends on Common Stock and does not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. Risk-Free Interest Rate The interest rates used are based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term equal to the expected life of the award. 
 Common Stock Valuations The grant date fair value of our Common Stock (pre-merger with Net Element) was typically determined by our board of directors with the assistance of management and a third-party valuation specialist. Given our pre-revenue stage of development, management believed that an Option Pricing Model OPM was the most appropriate method for allocating enterprise value to determine the estimated fair value of our Common Stock. Application of the OPM involved the use of estimates, judgment, and assumptions that are highly complex and subjective, such as those regarding our expected future revenue, expenses, and cash flows, discount rates, market multiples, the selection of comparable companies, and the probability of future events. Once Mullen s stock became publicly traded, the Board of Directors elected to determine the fair value of our post-merger Common Stock based on the closing market price the day before the date of grant. Warrant Valuations Management determined the fair value of the warrant liability for Series C warrants on recognition date and on subsequent dates as a maximum of (i) Black Scholes value for cash exercise of relevant warrants and (ii) current market value of the number of shares the Company would be required to issue upon cashless warrant exercise on a relevant date in accordance with warrant contract conditions. At each warrant exercise date and each accounting period end the warrant liability for the remaining unexercised warrants is marked-to-market value and the resulting gain or loss is recorded. The contracts for the Series D Warrants contain cashless exercise provisions similar to Series C Warrants described above. Therefore, Management applied similar accounting treatment to recognition, measurement and presentation of the warrant liabilities. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Accounting standard updates issued but not yet added were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Not Applicable. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. The consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the reports of the independent registered public accounting firm are filed as part of this Report and incorporated herein by reference.

 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures DCP that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed by us under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, is: (a) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms; and (b) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating our DCP, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and implemented, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. We conducted an evaluation pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our DCP as of September 30, 2022, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our DCP were not effective as of September 30, 2022, because of material weaknesses (the Material Weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and our dispositions of the assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2022. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In conducting our review of our internal control over financial reporting, we identified the continuing Material Weakness described below. 
 Based on management s review of key accounting and information technology policies and procedures as of September 30, 2022, we have determined that although such policies and procedures exist, they are not all formalized in a written procedure format that is up to date. Management has since identified, prioritized and prepared several of the critically important accounting policies and procedures and these are being reviewed and implemented. As a result of absence of formalized review of key controls across several business processes and insufficiently formalized documentation evidencing such review, management s ability to evaluate the design and monitor the 
 54 

Table of Contents 
 effective operation of these preventative and detective internal controls is limited. Accordingly, management s ability to timely detect, prevent and remediate deficiencies and potential fraud risks has been assessed as inadequate. The Company identified certain design deficiencies in its management and analytical review controls associated with the financial close process. These deficiencies, individually or in the aggregate, combined with inadequate compensating controls, created a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements might not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The Company lacks in-house accounting expertise to identify rights and obligations and reflected in non-standard agreements, requiring specialized accounting for complex transactions. 
 Management s Plan for Remediation We are engaged in ongoing efforts to remediate the control deficiencies that constituted the Material Weaknesses by implementing changes to our internal control over financial reporting, including, without limitation: a) ensuring that the Company can attract and retain staff with sufficient experience and knowledge in GAAP financial reporting matters; b) continuing professional training and academic education on accounting subjects for accounting staff; c) subscribing to relevant online services, other supplemental internal and external resources relating to SEC reporting; d) using GAAP Disclosure and SEC Reporting Checklists; e) engaging third-party accounting consulting firms to assist us in creating process narratives and the review of our application of GAAP on complex business combination, significant asset acquisitions, debt, and equity financing transactions; f) enhancing the precision relating to management review controls related to our financial statement close and financial reporting involving estimates, judgments, and assumptions; g) Augmenting the design of the financial statement closing and financial reporting process including inadequate documentation of accounting treatment of significant and unusual transactions. We believe these most recent measures will aid to remediate the control deficiencies that gave rise to the Material Weaknesses, but the Material Weaknesses will not be considered fully remediated until controls have been designed and implemented for a sufficient period of time for our management to conclude that the control environment is operating effectively. Additional remediation measures may be required, which may require additional implementation time. There is no assurance that our remediation efforts will be successful or that our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures will be effective. Attestation Report This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. As a non-accelerated filer, we are not subject to the attestation requirement. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Except as described above, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Mullen Automotive Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mullen Automotive Inc. (the Company at September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, deficiency in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern Uncertainty The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As described in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has sustained net losses, has indebtedness in default, and has a deficiency in working capital of approximately 36.0 million at September 30, 2022, which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Valuation of Intangible Assets and Goodwill in Acquisitions As described in Notes 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the 60 acquisition for consideration of 148.2 million (enterprise value 247.0 million) and the transaction was accounted for as business combinations. The Company recorded acquired intangible assets and goodwill at fair value on the date of acquisition using a discounted cash flow methodology. The methods used to estimate the fair 
 F-2 

Table of Contents 
 value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill involve significant assumptions. The significant assumptions applied by management in estimating the fair value of acquired intangible assets included income projections and discount rates. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of intangible assets in acquisitions are a critical audit matter are (1) there was a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in applying procedures relating to the fair value of intangible assets acquired due to the significant judgment by management when developing the estimates and (2) significant audit effort was required in evaluating the significant assumptions relating to the estimates, including the income projections and discount rates. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others, reading the purchase agreements, and testing management s process for estimating the fair value of intangible assets. Testing management s process included evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation models, testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the models, and testing the reasonableness of significant assumptions, including the income projections and discount rates. Evaluating the reasonableness of the income projections involved considering the current performance of the acquired business, the consistency with external market and industry data, and whether these assumptions were consistent with other evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions, including the discount rates, by comparing them against discount rate ranges that were independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable companies. Accounting for Contracts that Qualify as Liabilities As described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, during the year, the Company had an insufficient number of authorized shares available for issuance for the conversion of Series C Preferred Stock and exercise of warrants to purchase common stock. These financial instruments were measured at fair value on a recurring basis until the Company had sufficient authorized common stock. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of financial instruments is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value of the liabilities. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s significant assumptions related to the valuation models used and related variable inputs used within those models. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing management s process for developing the fair value estimate; evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation techniques; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the model; and evaluating the significant assumptions used by management. Evaluating management s assumptions related to the volatility amounts and discount rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering the current and historical performance, the consistency with external market and industry data, and whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. /s/ We have served as the Company s auditor since 2020.

Upon sale or disposition, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations. Company management continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying balances of its property, equipment and leasehold improvements may not be recoverable in accordance with the provisions of ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.

 . The Company acquired intangible assets in connection with the Bollinger acquisition which are being amortized over its estimated economic lives. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may have occurred. If such events or changes in circumstances arise, the Company compares the carrying amount of the long-lived assets to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the long-lived assets. If the estimated aggregate undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the long-lived assets, an impairment charge, calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets, is recorded. The fair value of the long-lived assets is determined based on the estimated discounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets. The Company has not recorded any such impairment charges during the years ended September 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. and , respectively.

Purchase accounting is open with respect to taxes until all tax basis information can be gathered. The following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price consideration to acquire Bollinger Motors: Cash consideration- deferred Stock consideration (book value of 41.2 million) Total Consideration Total consideration of million was paid or payable to Bollinger Motors and Bollinger shareholders as follows: Cash consideration due to Bollinger Motors is approximately million, of which million was paid at closing and million is to be paid in installments through August 5, 2023.

 Patents Trademarks Non-compete agreements Other non-current assets Accounts payable ) Refundable deposits ) Deferred tax liability ) Other current liabilities ) Estimated fair value of 100 of net assets acquired As a result of the acquisition transaction, Mullen acquired controlling interest of Bollinger. Acquired intellectual property, patents and non-compete agreements have finite life. The finite-lived intangible assets will be amortized using the straight-line method of the respective lives of each asset. Below are the acquired intangibles with their relative useful lives and method of amortization: Straight-line Patents Straight-line Trademarks Straight-line Non-compete agreements Straight-line Valuation Methodology The fair value of Intellectual Property was determined using the Relief from Royalty Method. This method was applied to the core intellectual property of Bollinger Motors consisting of the designs, trademarks and processes. Under the MPEEM, the Company determines free cash flows for a group of assets, and then adjusts it for a contributory charge for the use of other identifiable tangible and intangible assets. The present value of the resulting excess cash flows is adjusted for any tax benefits and the resulting amount represents the fair value of the intangible asset. The fair value of the Company s patents was determined using the Relief from Royalty Method. The method considers what a purchaser could afford, or would be willing to pay, for a license of similar intellectual property rights. The royalty stream is then capitalized reflecting the risk and return relationship of investing in the asset.

Termination of Employment. If Participant ceases to be employed by the Company and/or a Subsidiary prior to completion of the Vesting Requirements, Participant agrees that the RSUs awarded will be immediately and unconditionally forfeited without any action required by Participant or the Company, to the extent that the Vesting Requirements have not been met as of such cessation of employment. 3. No Ownership Rights Prior to Issuance of Common Stock. Participant shall not have any rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying the RSUs, including but not limited to the right to vote or receive dividends with respect to such shares of Common Stock, until and after the shares of Common Stock have been actually issued to Participant and transferred on the books and records of the Company. 4.

(b) Participant acknowledges that as of the date of this Agreement, the Agreement and the Plan set forth the entire understanding between Participant and the Company regarding the acquisition of shares of Common Stock underlying the RSUs in the Company and supersedes all prior oral and written agreements pertaining to the RSUs. (c) Participant understands that the Company has reserved the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time, and that the award of RSUs under the Plan at one time does not in any way obligate the Company or its Subsidiaries to grant additional RSUs in any future year or in any given amount.

No Right to Continued Employment. Neither the RSUs nor any terms contained in this Agreement shall confer upon Participant any expressed or implied right to be retained in the service of Company or any Subsidiary for any period at all, nor restrict in any way the right of Company or any such Subsidiary, which right is hereby expressly reserved, to terminate his or her employment at any time with or without cause. Participant acknowledges and agrees that any right to receive delivery of shares of Common Stock is earned only by continuing as an employee of Company or a Subsidiary at the will of Company or such Subsidiary, or satisfaction of any other applicable terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and the Plan, and not through the act of being hired, being granted the RSUs or acquiring shares of Common Stock hereunder. 9. Compliance with Laws and Regulations. The award of the RSUs to Participant and the obligation of the Company to deliver shares of Common Stock hereunder shall be subject to (a) all applicable federal, state, and local and laws, rules and regulations, and (b) any registration, qualification, approvals or other requirements imposed by any government or regulatory agency or body which the Company shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or applicable.

Acuitas understands that such securities have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws by reason of specific exemptions under the provisions thereof which depend in part upon the investment intent of it and of the other representations made by it in this Agreement. Acuitas understands that the Company is relying upon the representations and agreements contained in this Agreement (and any supplemental information) for the purpose of determining whether this transaction meets the requirements for such exemptions. Acuitas understands that such securities are restricted securities under applicable federal securities laws and that the Securities Act and the rules of the Commission provide in substance that it may dispose of such securities only pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and it understands that, except with regard to the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement that apply to such securities, the Company has no obligation or intention to register any of such securities or the offering or sale thereof, or to take action so as to permit offers or sales pursuant to the Securities Act or an exemption from registration thereunder (including pursuant to Rule 144 thereunder). Accordingly, Acuitas understands that under the Commission s rules, it may dispose of such securities only in private placements which are exempt from registration under the Securities Act, in which event the transferee will acquire restricted securities, subject to the same limitations that apply to such securities in the hands of it. Consequently, Acuitas understands that it must bear the economic risks of the investment in such securities for an indefinite period of time. Acuitas agrees: (A) that it will not sell, assign, pledge, give, transfer, or otherwise dispose of such securities or any interest therein, or make any offer or attempt to do any of the foregoing, unless the transaction is registered under the Securities Act and complies with the requirements of all applicable state securities laws, or the transaction is exempt from the registration provisions of the Securities Act and all applicable requirements of state securities laws; (B) that the certificates representing such securities or the books and records of the Company s transfer agent will bear a legend making reference to the foregoing restrictions; and (C) that the Company and its affiliates shall not be required to give effect to any purported transfer of such securities, except upon compliance with the foregoing restrictions.

Acuitas acknowledges that the Company did not offer to sell such securities to it by means of any form of general solicitation or advertising, including but not limited to: (A) any advertisement, article, notice or other communication published in any newspaper, magazine or similar media or broadcast over television or radio or (B) any seminar or meeting whose attendees were invited by any general solicitation or general advertising. The Parties acknowledge and agree that they are solely responsible for paying any attorneys fees and costs they incurred and that neither Party nor its attorney(s) will seek any award of attorneys fees or costs from the other Party, except as provided herein. 2. [Reserved] . 3. Mutual Release . The Parties, on behalf of themselves, their predecessors, successors, direct and indirect parent companies, direct and indirect subsidiary companies, companies under common control with any of the foregoing, affiliates, and assigns, and its and their past, present, and future officers, directors, shareholders, interest holders, members, partners, attorneys, agents, employees, managers, representatives, assigns, and successors in interest, and all persons acting by, through, under, or in concert with them, and each of them, hereby release and discharge the other Party, together with their predecessors, successors, direct and indirect parent companies, direct and indirect subsidiary companies, companies under common control with any of the foregoing, affiliates and assigns and its and their past, present, and future officers, directors, shareholders, interest holders, members, partners, attorneys, agents, employees, managers, representatives, assigns, and successors in interest, and all persons acting by, through, under, or in concert with them, and each of them, from all known and unknown charges, complaints, claims, grievances, liabilities, obligations, promises, agreements, controversies, damages, actions, causes of action, suits, rights, demands, costs, losses, debts, penalties, fees, wages, medical costs, pain and suffering, mental anguish, emotional distress, expenses (including attorneys fees and costs actually incurred), and punitive damages, of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, which either Party has, or may have had, against the other Party, whether or not apparent or yet to be discovered, or which may hereafter develop, for any acts or omissions related to or arising from the issuance of the Excess Stock, including all losses, costs, liabilities, obligations, expenses, fines, penalties, interest, expenditures, claims, awards, settlements, judgments, damages, reasonable and documented out-of-pocket attorneys fees and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of investigating, defending and prosecuting litigation relating to the issuance of the Excess Stock. This Agreement resolves any claim for relief that is, or could have been alleged, no matter how characterized, including, without limitation, compensatory damages, damages for breach of contract, bad faith damages, reliance damages, liquidated damages, damages for humiliation and embarrassment, punitive damages, costs, and attorneys fees related to or arising from the issuance of the Excess Stock. The Company agrees that each Buyer s full settlement of all claims or losses as described in this paragraph 3 is contingent upon the Company having filed with the Commission (at the Company s sole cost and expense) a registration statement registering the resale of the shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to the conversion or exercise of securities issued upon exercise of the Settlement Additional Purchase Right (which registration statement shall include 100 and 200 of the shares of Common Stock initially issuable upon conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock and the 
 3 

Warrants, respectively), the Company having brought such registration statement effective on or before April 1, 2023 and the Company using its commercially reasonable efforts to keep such registration continuously effective with respect to such shares, and to keep such registration statement or any subsequent shelf registration statement free of any material misstatements or omissions, until the earlier of the following: (1) each Buyer ceases to hold any of the shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the conversion of the Additional Securities; (2) the date all such shares may be sold without restriction under Rule 144, including without limitation, any volume and manner of sale restrictions which may be applicable to affiliates under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act and without the requirement for the Company to be in compliance with the current public information required under Rule 144(c)(1) or Rule 144(i)(2), as applicable, and (3) two years from the effective date of the registration statement registering such shares. On or before April 1, 2023, the Company will qualify as a well-known seasoned issuer as that term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act, provided that notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any other agreements between the Parties hereto the Company may, in order to meet the conditions of such qualification, issue additional shares of its Common Stock to Acuitas or to other persons. To the extent that the Company qualifies as a well-known seasoned issuer, the Company will file a registration statement on Form S-3 with automatic effectiveness on or before April 1, 2023 to register the resale of the shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to the conversion or exercise of securities issued upon exercise of the Settlement Additional Purchase Right. 4. No Outstanding or Known Future Claims/Causes of Action .

No Admission of Liability . The Parties acknowledge that the Settlement Payment and the granting of the Settlement Additional Purchase Right provided herein was agreed upon as a compromise and final settlement of disputed claims and that neither the payment of the Settlement Payment nor the grant of the Settlement Additional Purchase Right may be construed as an admission of liability by either Party and is not to be construed as an admission that either Party engaged in any wrongful, tortious, or unlawful activity. The Company specifically disclaims and denies (a) any liability to Acuitas and (b) engaging in any wrongful, tortious, or unlawful activity. 7. Agreement is Legally Binding .

Collectively, the Company and the Buyers shall be referred to as the Parties . Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the same meaning as set forth in the Securities Purchase Agreement (as defined below). RECITALS WHEREAS, the Parties entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 7, 2022 (as amended, the Securities Purchase Agreement ), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained therein, the Buyers have purchased and shall purchase on the Purchase Date the Commitment Amount of shares of the Company s Series D Preferred Stock, par value 0.001 per share (the Series D Preferred Stock ), and Warrants. WHEREAS, on November 15, 2022, the Parties entered into Amendment No. 3 Amendment No. 3 to the Securities Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which, the Buyers paid 150 million and, in lieu of receiving shares of Series D Preferred Stock and Warrants, received notes convertible into shares of the Company s Common Stock and Warrants Notes ). WHEREAS, the Company is currently in default under the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Notes and the Warrants (the Default ). WHEREAS, the Buyers agree to waive the Default and all damages that are incurred as a result of the Default prior to February 1, 2023 (the Waiver ). WHEREAS, in consideration for the Waiver, the Company shall grant the Buyers the right to purchase from the Company additional shares of Series D Preferred Stock and Warrants in an amount equal to such Buyer s pro rata portion of 10,000,000 on the same terms and conditions as applicable to the purchase and sale of shares of Series D Preferred Stock as provided under the Securities Purchase Agreement, subject to certain conditions and modifications described herein (the Second Additional Purchase Right ). NOW, THEREFORE , in consideration of the foregoing premises and the respective representations and warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Company and the Buyers agree as follows: AGREED TERMS 1. Settlement by the Company . In consideration for the settlement of the claims described herein, the Company agrees to grant each Buyer the Second Additional Purchase Right, which may be exercised by each Buyer from time to time, in its sole and absolute discretion in accordance with the same terms that apply to Additional Purchases as described in Section 4(p) of the Securities Purchase Agreement; provided, however, that (i) any Buyer that exercises its Second Additional Purchase Right shall receive Additional Warrants exercisable for 185 of shares of Common Stock at an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Common Stock as of the date of the Trading Day immediately prior to 

the exercise of the Second Additional Purchase Right and (ii) that Additional Warrants issued pursuant to the Second Additional Purchase Right will be in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A . Shares of Series D Preferred Stock and Warrants purchased pursuant to the Second Additional Purchase Right shall be subject to the same terms and conditions of the Securities Purchase Agreement as if they were Additional Purchase Shares or Additional Warrants, respectively. Each Buyer acknowledges that the securities it is acquiring pursuant to the Second Additional Purchase Right are securities as defined in Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Each Buyer represents that it is acquiring such securities solely for its own beneficial account, for investment purposes, and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution of the securities. Each Buyer understands that such securities have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws by reason of specific exemptions under the provisions thereof which depend in part upon the investment intent of it and of the other representations made by it in this Agreement. Each Buyer understands that the Company is relying upon the representations and agreements contained in this Agreement (and any supplemental information) for the purpose of determining whether this transaction meets the requirements for such exemptions. Each Buyer understands that such securities are restricted securities under applicable federal securities laws and that the Securities Act and the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission provide in substance that it may dispose of such securities only pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and it understands that, except with regard to the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement that apply to such securities, the Company has no obligation or intention to register any such securities or the offering or sale thereof, or to take action so as to permit offers or sales pursuant to the Securities Act or an exemption from registration thereunder (including pursuant to Rule 144 thereunder). Accordingly, each Buyer understands that under the Commission s rules, it may dispose of such securities only in private placements which are exempt from registration under the Securities Act, in which event the transferee will acquire restricted securities, subject to the same limitations that apply to such securities in the hands of it. Consequently, each Buyer understands that it must bear the economic risks of the investment in such securities for an indefinite period of time.] Each Buyer agrees: (A) that it will not sell, assign, pledge, give, transfer, or otherwise dispose of such securities or any interest therein, or make any offer or attempt to do any of the foregoing, unless the transaction is registered under the Securities Act and complies with the requirements of all applicable state securities laws, or the transaction is exempt from the registration provisions of the Securities Act and all applicable requirements of state securities laws; (B) that the certificates representing such securities or the books and records of the Company s transfer agent will bear a legend making reference to the foregoing restrictions; and (C) that the Company and its affiliates shall not be required to give effect to any purported transfer of such securities, except upon compliance with the foregoing restrictions. Each Buyer acknowledges that the Company did not offer to sell such securities to it by means of any form of general solicitation or advertising, including but not limited to: (A) any advertisement, article, notice or other communication published in any newspaper, magazine or similar media or broadcast over television or radio or (B) any seminar or meeting whose attendees were invited by any general solicitation or general advertising.

Reserved . 3. Mutual Release . The Parties, on behalf of themselves, their predecessors, successors, direct and indirect parent companies, direct and indirect subsidiary companies, companies under common control with any of the foregoing, affiliates, and assigns, and its and their past, present, and future officers, directors, shareholders, interest holders, members, partners, attorneys, agents, employees, managers, representatives, assigns, and successors in interest, and all persons acting by, through, under, or in concert with them, and each of them, hereby release and discharge the other Party, together with their predecessors, successors, direct and indirect parent companies, direct and indirect subsidiary companies, companies under common control with any of the foregoing, affiliates and assigns and its and their past, present, and future officers, directors, shareholders, interest holders, members, partners, attorneys, agents, employees, managers, representatives, assigns, and successors in interest, and all persons acting by, through, under, or in concert with them, and each of them, from all known and unknown charges, complaints, claims, grievances, liabilities, obligations, promises, agreements, controversies, damages, actions, causes of action, suits, rights, demands, costs, losses, debts, penalties, fees, wages, medical costs, pain and suffering, mental anguish, emotional distress, expenses (including attorneys fees and costs actually incurred), and punitive damages, of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, which either Party has, or may have had, against the other Party, whether or not apparent or yet to be discovered, or which may hereafter develop, for any acts or omissions related to or arising from the Default, including all losses, costs, liabilities, obligations, expenses, fines, penalties, interest, expenditures, claims, awards, settlements, judgments, damages, reasonable and documented out-of-pocket attorneys fees and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of investigating, defending and prosecuting litigation relating to the Default that were incurred prior to February 1, 2023.

On or before April 1, 2023, the Company will qualify as a well-known seasoned issuer as that term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act, provided that notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any other agreements between the Parties hereto the Company may, in order to meet the conditions of such qualification, issue additional shares of its Common Stock to the Buyers or to other persons.

The Holder shall not be required to deliver the original of this Warrant in order to effect an exercise hereunder.

Nothing herein shall limit the Holder s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company s failure to timely deliver the Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant as required pursuant to the terms hereof. (d) Cashless Exercise .

(e) Disputes . In the case of a dispute as to the determination of the Exercise Price or the arithmetic calculation of the number of Warrant Shares to be issued pursuant to the terms hereof (including, without limitation, the Net Number), the Company shall promptly issue to the Holder the number of Warrant Shares that are not disputed, provided that following such issuance to Holder such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with Section 13. (f) Limitations on Exercises and Exchan g es . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Warrant, this Warrant shall not be exercisable or exchangeable by the Holder hereof to the extent (but only to the extent) that the Holder or any of its affiliates would beneficially own in excess of 9.99 of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding after giving effect to the issuance of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act (the Maximum Percentage ). To the extent the above limitation applies, the determination of whether this Warrant shall be exercisable or exchangeable (vis- -vis other convertible, exercisable or exchangeable securities owned by the Holder or any of its affiliates) and of which such securities shall be exercisable or exchangeable (as among all such securities owned by the Holder) shall, subject to such Maximum Percentage limitation, be determined on the basis of the first submission to the Company for conversion, exercise or exchange (as the case may be). No prior inability to exercise or exchange this Warrant pursuant to this paragraph shall have any effect on the applicability of the provisions of this paragraph with respect to any subsequent determination of exercisability or exchangeability.

The provisions of this paragraph shall be implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this paragraph to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Maximum Percentage beneficial ownership limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such Maximum Percentage limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor Holder of this 

 Warrant. The holders of Common Stock shall be third party beneficiaries of this paragraph and the Company may not waive this paragraph without the consent of holders of a majority of its Common Stock. For any reason at any time, upon the written or oral request of the Holder, the Company shall within two (2) Business Days confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding, including by virtue of any prior conversion or exercise or exchange of convertible or exercisable or exchangeable securities into shares of Common Stock, including, without limitation, pursuant to this Warrant or securities issued pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement.
