EXPLANATORY
NOTES 

The
Dallas Market Center Mortgage Loan, which constituted approximately 10.5 of the asset pool of the issuing entity as of its cut-off
date, is an asset of the issuing entity and is part of a loan combination that includes the Dallas Market Center Mortgage Loan
and one other pari passu loan, which is not an asset of the issuing entity. This loan combination, including the Dallas
Market Center Mortgage Loan, is being serviced and administered pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, which is incorporated
by reference as Exhibit 4.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The
Exhibit Index describes exhibits provided by certain parties (in their capacities indicated on the Exhibit Index) with respect
to the Selig Office Portfolio Mortgage Loan and the 170 Broadway Mortgage Loan, which constituted approximately 9.9 and 1.6 ,
respectively, of the asset pool of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date. The Selig Office Portfolio Mortgage Loan and
the 170 Broadway Mortgage Loan are each an asset of the issuing entity and are each part of a loan combination that includes (a)
with respect to the Selig Office Portfolio Mortgage Loan, two other pari passu loans, which are not assets of the issuing
entity or (b) with respect to the 170 Broadway Mortgage Loan, one other pari passu loan, which is not an asset of the issuing
entity. A pari passu portion of each loan combination was securitized in the Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2015-GC29
transaction, Commission File Number 333-189017-08 (the CGCMT 2015-GC29 Transaction ). These loan combinations,
including the Selig Office Portfolio Mortgage Loan and the 170 Broadway Mortgage Loan, are being serviced and administered pursuant
to the pooling and servicing agreement for the CGCMT 2015-GC29 Transaction, which is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.2
to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The
master servicer of a pooling and servicing agreement or trust and servicing agreement also functions as the primary servicer of
the related mortgage loans serviced and administered pursuant to such agreement unless a separate primary servicer is identified
herein. If this report does not identify a separate primary servicer, the servicer compliance statement provided by the master
servicer under any such agreement also encompasses its responsibilities as primary servicer of the related mortgage loan or mortgage
loans. 

Midland
Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National Association is the master servicer of the mortgage loans serviced under the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement, the special servicer of the mortgage loans serviced under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement prior to
October 7, 2022 and the primary servicer and special servicer of the Selig Office Portfolio Mortgage Loan and the 170 Broadway
Mortgage Loan. As a result, Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National Association is a servicer as
defined in Item 1108(a)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, in the capacities described above, because it is servicing mortgage loans that
constituted 10 or more of the assets of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date. The assessments of compliance with applicable
servicing criteria, accountants attestation reports and servicer compliance statements delivered by Midland Loan Services,
a Division of PNC Bank, National Association in the capacities described above are listed in the Exhibit Index. 

Berkeley
Point Capital LLC d/b/a Newmark is an affiliate of Cantor Commercial Real Estate Lending L.P., one of the sponsors. Therefore,
the Depositor included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K a servicer compliance statement for Berkeley Point Capital LLC d/b/a
Newmark pursuant to Item 1123. Because Berkeley Point Capital LLC d/b/a Newmark is servicing less than 5 of the pool assets,
an assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria and an accountants attestation report pursuant to Item 1122
of Regulation AB are not required by Regulation AB. As the attestation made in the servicer compliance statement required
by Item 1123 relates to a review of the servicing activities of Berkeley Point Capital LLC d/b/a Newmark under the applicable
servicing agreement, and that review was conducted in conjunction with the servicer s preparation of its assessment of compliance
with applicable servicing criteria, that assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria and the accompanying accountants 
attestation report are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the sake of completeness. 

Deutsche
Bank Trust Company Americas is the custodian of the Selig Office Portfolio Mortgage Loan and the 170 Broadway Mortgage Loan. As
a result, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is a servicing function participant in the capacities described above, because
it is servicing mortgage loans that constituted 5 or more of the assets of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date. The assessments
of compliance with applicable servicing criteria and accountants attestation reports delivered by Deutsche Bank Trust Company
Americas in the capacities described above are listed in the Exhibit Index. 

Situs
Holdings, LLC is the operating advisor of the Selig Office Portfolio Mortgage Loan and the 170 Broadway Mortgage Loan. As a result,
Situs Holdings, LLC is a servicing function participant in the capacities described above, because it is servicing mortgage loans
that constituted 5 or more of the assets of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date. The assessments of compliance with applicable
servicing criteria and accountants attestation reports delivered by Situs Holdings, LLC in the capacities described above
are listed in the Exhibit Index. 

The
assessments of compliance with applicable servicing criteria, accountants attestation reports and servicer compliance statements
of the certificate administrator of the 170 Broadway Mortgage Loan and the Selig Office Portfolio Mortgage Loan are omitted from
this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the certificate administrator pursuant to the related pooling and servicing agreement or trust
and servicing agreement does not perform any activities that address servicing criteria with respect to the issuing entity and
because they are each not a servicer that meets the criteria in Item 1108(a)(2)(i) through (iii) of Regulation AB.

Item
1117 of Regulation AB, Legal Proceedings. 

The
registrant knows of no material pending legal proceeding involving the trust or any party related to the trust, other than routine
litigation incidental to the duties of those respective parties, and the following, with respect to Deutsche Bank Trust Company
Americas, as Trustee and Custodian, and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, Certificate Administrator and Custodian. 

Deutsche
Bank Trust Company Americas DBTCA and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company DBNTC have been sued
by investors in civil litigation concerning their role as trustees of certain residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS trusts. 

On
June 18, 2014, a group of investors, including funds managed by Blackrock Advisors, LLC, PIMCO-Advisors, L.P., and others, filed
an action against DBNTC and DBTCA in New York State Supreme Court alleging that DBNTC and DBTCA failed to perform purported duties,
as trustees for 544 private-label RMBS trusts, to enforce breaches of representations and warranties as to mortgage loans held
by the trusts and to enforce breaches by servicers of their mortgage loan servicing obligations for the trusts. During the course
of the litigation, plaintiffs dismissed the case from New York State Supreme Court and refiled two separate cases, one in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the BlackRock SDNY Case and the other in the
Superior Court of California, Orange County (the BlackRock California Case ). Pursuant to a settlement among
the parties, the BlackRock SDNY Case was dismissed on December 6, 2018, and the BlackRock California Case was dismissed
on January 11, 2019. 

On
September 27, 2017, DBTCA was added as a defendant to a case brought by certain special purpose entities including Phoenix Light
SF Limited in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, in which the plaintiffs previously alleged incorrectly
that DBNTC served as trustee for all 43 of the trusts at issue. On September 27, 2017, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint
that names DBTCA as a defendant in addition to DBNTC. DBTCA serves as trustee for one of the 43 trusts at issue. DBNTC serves
as trustee for the other 42 trusts at issue. Plaintiffs third amended complaint brings claims for violation of the U.S.
Trust Indenture Act of 1939 TIA ); breach of contract; breach of fiduciary duty; negligence and gross negligence;
violation of New York s Streit Act; and breach of the covenant of good faith. However, in the third amended complaint, plaintiffs
acknowledge that, before DBTCA was added to the case, the court dismissed plaintiffs TIA Act claims, negligence and gross
negligence claims, Streit Act claims, claims for breach of the covenant of good faith, and certain theories of plaintiffs 
breach of contract claims, and plaintiffs only include these claims to preserve any rights on appeal. Plaintiffs allege damages
of hundreds of millions of dollars. On November 13, 2017, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to the third amended complaint.
On December 7, 2018, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion for summary judgment. Also on December 7, 2018, plaintiffs, jointly with Commerzbank
AG (see description of Commerzbank case below), filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On October 27, 2021, DBNTC and DBTCA
filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment relating to plaintiffs standing. On February 8, 2022, the court issued
an order in which it granted DBNTC and DBTCA s supplemental motion for summary judgment, granted in part DBNTC and DBTCA s
initial motion for summary judgment, and denied plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment. As a result of that order,
all of plaintiffs claims were dismissed with prejudice. On March 10, 2022, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit with respect to the court s orders on the motions to dismiss and for summary
judgment. 

On
November 30, 2017, DBTCA was added as a defendant to a case brought by Commerzbank AG Commerzbank in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York, in which Commerzbank previously alleged incorrectly that DBNTC served as
trustee for all 50 of the trusts at issue. On November 30, 2017, Commerzbank filed a second amended complaint that names DBTCA
as a defendant in addition to DBNTC. DBTCA serves as trustee for 1 of the 50 trusts at issue. DBNTC serves as trustee for the
other 49 trusts at issue. Commerzbank s second amended complaint brings claims for violation of the TIA; breach of contract;
breach of fiduciary duty; negligence; violation of the Streit Act; and breach of the covenant of good faith. However, in the second
amended complaint, Commerzbank acknowledges that, before DBTCA was added to the case, the court dismissed Commerzbank s
TIA claims for the trusts governed by pooling and servicing agreements, as well as its Streit Act claims and claims for breach
of the covenant of good faith, and Commerzbank only includes these claims to preserve any rights on appeal. The second amended
complaint alleges that DBNTC and DBTCA caused Commerzbank to suffer hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, but
the complaint does not include a demand for money damages in a sum certain. On January 29, 2018, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer
to the second amended complaint. On December 7, 2018, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion for summary judgment. Also on December 7,
2018, Commerzbank, jointly with the Phoenix Light plaintiffs, filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On February
8, 2022, the court issued an order in which it granted in part DBNTC and DBTCA s motion for summary judgment and denied
plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment. As a result of that order, many of plaintiffs claims and theories
were dismissed with prejudice. Discovery is ongoing. 

On
December 30, 2015, IKB International, S.A. in Liquidation and IKB Deutsche Industriebank A.G. (collectively, IKB ),
as an investor in 37 RMBS trusts, filed a summons with notice in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County,
against DBNTC and DBTCA as trustees of the trusts. On May 27, 2016, IKB served its complaint asserting claims for breach of contract,
breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, violation of the Streit Act, violation of the TIA, violation
of Regulation AB, and violation of Section 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. IKB alleges that DBNTC and DBTCA are liable for over
U.S. 268 million in damages. On October 5, 2016, DBNTC and DBTCA, together with several other trustees defending lawsuits by
IKB, filed a joint motion to dismiss. On January 6, 2017 and June 20, 2017, IKB voluntarily dismissed with prejudice all claims
as to seven trusts. On January 27, 2021, the court granted in part and denied in part DBNTC and DBTCA s motion to dismiss.
The court granted the motion to dismiss with respect to IKB s claims for violations of the Streit Act, Regulation AB, and
Section 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, as well as certain aspects of IKB s claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary
duty, and violation of the TIA. The court denied the remainder of the motion to dismiss. IKB s remaining claims for breach
of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and violation of the TIA will proceed. On
May 10, 2021, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a notice of appeal with the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division, First Department, regarding
certain aspects of the court s order on the motion to dismiss. On May 20, 2021, IKB filed a notice of cross appeal with
respect to other aspects of that order. On August 30, 2022, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department affirmed
in part and reversed in part the court s order on the motion to dismiss. On November 10, 2022, the First Department granted
DBNTC and DBTCA s motion for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals, and denied IKB s separate motion for reargument
and leave to appeal. On June 2, 2021, IKB filed a motion for re-argument regarding certain aspects of the court s order
on the motion to dismiss, which the court denied on August 3, 2021. On May 13, 2021, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to the complaint.
On October 28, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to seven additional
trusts. On December 29, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to one additional
trust. On April 22, 2022, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to 17 certificates
at issue (including all claims as to 5 trusts), leaving 17 trusts at issue. Discovery is ongoing. 

It
is DBTCA s belief that it has no pending legal proceedings (including, based on DBTCA s present evaluation, the litigation
disclosed in the foregoing paragraphs) that would materially affect its ability to perform its duties under the related servicing
agreement. 

In
the last several years, U.S. Bank National Association U.S. Bank and other large financial institutions have been
sued in their capacity as trustee or successor trustee for certain residential mortgage backed securities RMBS trusts.
The complaints, primarily filed by investors or investor groups against U.S. Bank and similar institutions, allege the trustees
caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers to comply with
the governing agreements for these RMBS trusts. Plaintiffs generally assert causes of action based upon the trustees purported
failures to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties, notify
securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers
and abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default. 

U.S.
Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions
were not the cause of losses to investors, that it has meritorious defenses, and it has contested and intends to continue contesting
the plaintiffs claims vigorously. However, U.S. Bank cannot assure you as to the outcome of any of the litigation, or the
possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. 

On
March 9, 2018, a law firm purporting to represent fifteen Delaware statutory trusts (the DSTs that issued securities
backed by student loans (the Student Loans filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against U.S. Bank
National Association U.S. Bank in its capacities as indenture trustee and successor special servicer, and three
other institutions in their respective transaction capacities, with respect to the DSTs and the Student Loans. This lawsuit is
captioned The National Collegiate Student Loan Master Trust I, et al. v. U.S. Bank National Association, et al., C.A. No. 2018-0167-JRS
(Del. Ch.) (the NCMSLT Action ). The complaint, as amended on June 15, 2018, alleged that the DSTs have been harmed
as a result of purported misconduct or omissions by the defendants concerning administration of the trusts and special servicing
of the Student Loans. Since the filing of the NCMSLT Action, certain Student Loan borrowers have made assertions against U.S.
Bank concerning special servicing that appear to be based on certain allegations made on behalf of the DSTs in the NCMSLT Action. 

U.S.
Bank believes that it has performed its obligations as indenture trustee and special servicer in good faith and in compliance
in all material respects with the terms of the agreements governing the DSTs (the Governing Agreements ), and accordingly
that the claims against it in the NCMSLT Action are without merit. 

U.S.
Bank has filed a motion seeking dismissal of the operative complaint in its entirety with prejudice pursuant to Chancery Court
Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) or, in the alternative, a stay of the case while other prior filed disputes involving the DSTs and
the Student Loans are litigated. On November 7, 2018, the Court ruled that the case should be stayed in its entirety pending resolution
of the first-filed cases. On January 21, 2020, the Court entered an order consolidating for pretrial purposes the NCMSLT Action
and three other lawsuits pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery concerning the DSTs and the Student Loans (the Consolidated
Action ). U.S. Bank and other parties to the Consolidated Action have briefed and argued motions for judgment on the pleadings
pursuant to Chancery Court Rule 12(c) regarding disputed issues of contractual interpretation at issue in one or more of the cases
comprising the Consolidated Action, including the NCMSLT Action. The Court has not yet ruled on these motions or on U.S. Bank s
dismissal motion in the NCMSLT Action.

 BERKELEY POINT CAPITAL LLC D/B/A NEWMARK, AS PRIMARY SERVICER

MANAGEMENT S
ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 

PURSUANT
TO ITEM 1122 
 OF REGULATION AB 

Management
of Berkeley Point
Capital LLC d/b/a
 Newmark Newmark is responsible for
assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth
in Item 1122(d) of Regulation
 AB of the Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC relating
 to its role in
 the servicing of commercial mortgage-backed
 securities transactions conducted
by Newmark (the
 Platform 
 as of
 and for the
 year ended December
 31, 2022 (the
 Reporting Period ).
 Appendix A
identifies the individual asset-backed
 transactions and
 securities defined
 by management as
constituting the Platform. 

Newmark s
management has assessed
 Newmark s compliance
with the applicable
servicing criteria during the
Reporting Period. In making this assessment,
 management used the criteria
 set forth
by the SEC 
 in paragraph (d) of
Item 1122 of
Regulation AB, excluding the criteria set forth
in Appendix B,
 which management
 has determined are not
 applicable to
 the servicing
 activities it
 performs with respect
 to the
Platform. 

With
 respect to applicable
servicing criteria identified
in Appendix C, there
 were no
 activities performed
 for the
Reporting Period with 
 respect to
the Platform, because
there was no occurrence of events that
 would require
Newmark to perform such activities. 

With
respect to servicing criteria
 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(vi)
 and 1122(d)(2)(vii),
 management has
 engaged Midland
Loan Services, a division
of PNC Bank,
 National Association Midland to perform the activities
required by these servicing
 criteria. Newmark management
has determined that Midland is
 not a servicer 
 as defined
in Item 1101(j) of
Regulation AB, and Newmark s
 management has elected
 to take responsibility for assessing
 compliance with the servicing
 criteria applicable
to Midland as permitted
 by the
 SEC s Compliance and Disclosure
Interpretation C D1 200.06,
Vendors Engaged by Servicers
 (C DI 200.06) 

 (formerly
 SEC Regulation
 AB Manual
 of Publicly
 Available Telephone
Interpretations, 17.06). Management
 has policies and
procedures in place designed
to provide reasonable assurance that
 Midland s activities comply in
all material respects 
 with the
 servicing criteria
applicable to Midland.
 Newmark has not
identified and is not
aware of any material instances of noncompliance by
 Midland with the applicable servicing
criteria during the Reporting
 Period, with
 respect to the
 Platform taken
as a whole, nor has
 it identified any
material deficiencies in its policies
 and procedures
 to monitor the
 compliance by
 Midland with
 the applicable
 servicing criteria
 during the Reporting
 Period with
 respect to
 the Platform taken
as a whole.
 Newmark is
solely responsible for determining
that it meets the
 SEC requirements
 to apply C DI 200.06 for
Midland and the related criteria. 

Based
 on such assessment,
management believes that 
 with respect to
 the Reporting
 Period, Newmark
 has complied
 in all
material respects with
the servicing criteria set 
 forth in
Item 1122(d) of Regulation
AB of the SEC, including
 servicing criteria
 1122(d)(1)(v),1122(d)(2)(vi)
 and 1122(d)(2)(vii)
for which compliance is 
 determined based on C DI 200.06
 as described above relating
 to its
role in the
 servicing of the
 Platform.

pwc
(logo) 

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To
the Board of Directors, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Assessment of Compliance
with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that Midland Loan Services, a division of PNC Bank, National Association Midland 
or the Company ), complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s
Regulation AB for all transactions serviced on the Enterprise! Loan Management System (the Platform as of December 31, 2022 and for the year then ended excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B), 1122(d)(3)(i)(C), 1122(d)(3)(i)(D),
1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(iv), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the
servicing activities performed by them with respect to the Platform. Midland s management is responsible for its assertion
and for the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination. 

As
described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(i), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(iv),
1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company has engaged certain vendors to perform the activities
required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered servicers 
as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with
the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division
of Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules adopted under Regulation AB and the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act Interpretation 200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies
and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects
with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC
requirements to apply Interpretation 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed
no procedures with respect to the Company s determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and
in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining,
on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected asset-backed transactions
and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether
the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the
period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred
prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during
the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s
compliance with the servicing criteria.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Members of 

 LNR Partners, LLC 

We have examined management s assertion, included
in the accompanying Management Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria included on Appendix
A, that LNR Partners, LLC (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities
and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the commercial mortgaged-backed securities transactions for which the Company
served as special servicer and that were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act
of 1933 as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the Platform ), excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), (3)(i)(C),
(3)(i)(D), (3)(ii), (3)(iii), (3)(iv), (4)(v), (4)(ix), (4)(x), (4)(xi), (4)(xii), (4)(xiii), (4)(xiv) and (4) (xv) (the servicing
criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, which management has determined are not applicable to the activities
performed by the Company with respect to the Platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the servicing
criteria and its assertion. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s
compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the servicing criteria is fairly stated,
in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the servicing activities related to the Platform, determining
whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing
activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included
servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction included in the Platform. Further, an examination is not designed
to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have affected the
balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that the evidence
we obtained in our examination is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

As described in management s assertion, for servicing
criteria Item 1122(d)(2)(vii), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform certain activities required by this servicing criteria.
The Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation
AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to this
vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI
200.06 ). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed
to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria
applicable to this vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI
200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s
determination of its eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

Our examination does not provide a legal determination
on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

In our opinion, management s assertion
that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, for the commercial
mortgage-backed securities Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. Management is responsible
for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s
assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence
about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions
and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining
whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing
criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company

ethical requirements related to our examination engagement.

our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2022, for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities Platform is fairly stated, in all material
respects.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

Berkeley
Point Capital LLC 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assessment of Compliance with Applicable
Servicing Criteria Pursuant to Item 1122 of Regulation AB, that Berkeley Point Capital LLC d/b/a Newmark (the Company) complied
with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the
commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions conducted by Newmark platform as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022,
except for Items 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(ii), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i), 1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(iv),
1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities performed
by them with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. Refer to Appendix A of Management s Assessment of
Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria Pursuant to Item 1122 of Regulation AB for the asset backed transactions covered
by this platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based
on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence
about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset backed transactions
and securities that comprise the platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform and determining
whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing
criteria and as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations of the Division of Corporation Finance, Section
200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected
transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not
designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances
or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any
other transactions. Although the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with items 1122(d)(4)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(viii),
1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(xii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by the Company
during the year ended December 31, 2022 that required these servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe that the evidence
we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

A
member firm of Ernst Young Global Limited 

We
are required to be independent of Berkeley Point Capital LLC d/b/a Newmark and to meet our other ethical responsibilities,
in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our examination engagement. 

Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

As
described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(vi) and 1122(d)(2)(vii) , the
Company has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that this
vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to
take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria applicable to this vendor as permitted by
C DI 200.06. As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed
to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable
to this vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06
for the vendor and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s
eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of
the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB, including servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(vi) and 1122(d)(2)(vii)
for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022
for the commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions platform, is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Deutsche
Bank National Trust Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assertion of Compliance, that Trust
 Agency Services department of Deutsche Bank National Trust Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (collectively
the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s
Regulation AB for the publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended) and certain privately-issued (i.e., for which transaction-level reporting is required pursuant to contractual obligation)
residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities issued on or after
January 1, 2006, for which the Company provides trustee, certificate administrator, securities administration, paying agent or
custodian services, as defined in the transaction agreements, excluding publicly-issued securities sponsored or issued by any
government sponsored entity (the Platform ), as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 except for criteria 1122(d)(4)(iv)
 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the
servicing platform covered by this report. Refer to Appendix A of Management s Assertion of Compliance for the asset backed
transactions covered by this platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing
criteria based on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence
about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset backed transactions
and securities that comprise the platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform and determining
whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing
criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company
during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either
prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during
the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible
for assessing compliance with criteria 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii) of Regulation AB,
there were no servicing activities performed by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022 that required these servicing
criteria to be complied with. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion. 

We
are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant
ethical requirements related to our examination engagement. 

Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2022 for the platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.
